The syllabus looks wonderful. I'm looking forward to learning from Professor Rabkin, as well as from our fellow course mates. Cheers.  ;Hello Theodossai,Happy to meet you here as well! Indeed, we live in interesting times for sure. Many things that once seemed like science fiction are now science. This is one of the things I love about this genre--that which can be imagined may one day be...more than imagined (i.e. real). I also like your question here...""what is real?"" A perfect theme for some of the sci-fi/fantasy that I have read. Philip K. Dick comes to mind, along with a slew of other authors.I look forward to exploring this course together.Cheers;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee."" All the readings except Ray Bradbury's  The Martian Chronicles  and Ursula K. LeGuin's  The Left Hand of Darkness  will be available online at no charge.Yep, it's the whole thing. However, I will say that it is not essential to discuss every single story...it wouldn't be a coherent reading since there may be broad themes overall, not every theme is in every story.  ;Thanks for that Grimm's clarification, William. I too had initially interpreted ""the specific stories"" to mean we would get a list of selections for this first reading assignment as part of Thursday's ""before you read"" video, but your comment makes much more sense, so I will get busy with the complete Crane translation.;I like making lists in twitter to keep in touch somewhat fast. I will create this course's one tomorrow, so start giving me your usernames so I can add you and you may follow the list to find more people from this course.I also suggest using some Hashtag over there to talk about this course, so I'd like your suggestions.:D;"

Step-mothers must have been a very common occurance.;I would have an easier time deciding on a Least favorite of their tales ... and yet still, I think it'd be hard to choose.;To be honest I don't think it matters, but it makes for great discussion :)I  completely agree with your point about wonder in science (for me evolution and synthetic biology are simply  awesome); and the wherefores in religion (Leviticus - OMG :) .I think Frankenstein and SF/F is a bit like the chicken/egg question - which came first? (clearly a lizard with feathers). In other words I don't think it is really either - but is instead something part of the way between religion and science which looks like SF but  doesn't yet have all the characteristics as we know them now.;Cheri,I like 'speculative fiction'. There seems to be a strong tendency to categorize the arts, literature included. For example, think of how may genres (and sub-genres) there are in music. The same can be said for stories and books. But do all stories fit neatly into one single category? I don't think they do, but using the categories to classify books by the general themes they employ can be useful, if not too limiting.  ;I'm with you, William. It's useful to talk about what ""kind"" of story one could expect from a book, but the classic terms ""sci fi"" and ""fantasy"" are a bit square these days. Additionally, many people are so zealous in their definitions of those terms that I like to avoid them when I can. I tend to be drawn to books that are neither one or the other, but are clearly in that ""what if"" category that breaks the bounds of real life (whatever that is). ""Speculative Fiction"" (not my own invention, to be sure) indicates a step away from the real world as we know it and a step into a world that has currently unavailable elements (like magic, or dragons, or space travel).;These are the real versions, not the Disney versions. That is a significant difference IMHO. I love the Grimm's Tales, as written. I own a Lucy Crane translation (with Walter Crane illustrations) that is essentially the same book Prof. Rabkin suggests, but the pagination is different. I am up to page 161 of 313. I plan on reading several more stories tonight.  ;I don't mean to be contradictory, but...there are actually other units that cover more than one story - Unit 2 covers Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (two separate stories), Unit 5 covers several stories from Hawthorne and several from Poe, Unit 6 covers two novels and also two short stories from Wells, Unit 7 covers a novel from Burroughs and another novel from Gilman. See the Syllabus for details.  ;I second the vote for Neil Gaiman. See, for instance, American Gods. Or, perhaps, this book is more a modern form of mythology rather than a fairytale? Also consider the works of H.P, Lovecraft. Though these are considered Horror (for good reason), they might also be considered a type of mythology.  Here is a question for us to ponder...what is the difference between mythology and fairytales?  ;Cheri, I've watched several episodes of Grimm (the TV series). I like it, for the most part. Some of the characters are done well, and the story line kept my interest up through the first season. Then my interest started to fade. It became a bit predictable for me. I don't know though, I might go back to it again with fresh eyes, having just read Grimm's Household Tales for this course. :)  Kevin, ""Urban Fantasy"" seems to be the name of a genre I used to know as ""Magical Realism"". In any case, I see reference to Urban Fantasy much more than to Magical Realism these days, so maybe the former name won out. Or perhaps they are different genres altogether, but if so, they have a LOT of cross-overs. I wonder sometimes who comes up with these genre titles? Is it the authors or the marketers and publishing houses? I think that would make a difference. An author writes a great book and it starts to sell. Marketers say, ""Oh look, potential for a new market, we can make lots of money, let's call it X and package it for the masses"". Or something like that. :/ Writing and the book business are two completely different animals. Of course, I want authors to make money, so they can continue to write excellent books for me to read and enjoy, but I've heard some horror stories (pun intended) about the book business. It seems authors get shafted a lot of the time, unless they make the best seller's list.Faith, I'm a huge Doctor Who fan! I started watching the series back when Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) was the current Doctor. I was excited when BBC began a new round in 2005 with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston).  ;Gaiman dedicates American Gods to Karen Acker and Roger Zelazny. For those familiar with Zelazny, you will see the connection here (direct use of characters and subjects from mythology in a novel way, in a contemporary/modern/postmodern setting).  Karen, thanks for pointing out Charles de Lint. I've heard the name, but have actually never read anything by him. I will check him out. Any particular recommendations as a first book to read by him?;Thanks for the recommendations Karen. I am scanning a list of titles to pick my first de Lint book. I am having a ""Why haven't I ever read Charles de Lint?"" moment. LOL.  ;Thanks for sharing this David. I am going to read the essay by Tolkien. A quick glance...it looks wonderful. I would expect no less from such a master of the art.  ;Greetings course mates,See this article on The Guardian about a recent (circa 2010 - 2012) discovery of over 500 fairy tales, all collected around the same time the Grimm brothers were collecting tales.  A quote from the article:Von Sch  nwerth spent decades asking country folk, labourers and servants about local habits, traditions, customs and history, and putting down on paper what had only been passed on by word of mouth. In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: ""Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.""Also, here is a second article about the discovery, this one published in  The New Yorker.I thought this might be of interest to some here, especially considering our current reading for Unit 1.  ;Excellent response Megan! Your understanding of the instructional clips from Prof. Rabkin matches mine exactly.  Emily, just keep in mind this is a humanities course, not a science course. The type and form of writing between the two disciplines are vastly different.  ;P.S., Emily, in addition to the videos and what others have already said, perhaps this article on Purdue OWL might be helpful as well.  ;Haha, I feel the same way, we need an ""I'm a writer doing research for a novel"" tag on our searches. In lieu of that, there is always TOR (says the man, posting under his name).;Hi Gretchen,You ask why in the tale, ""The Death of the Hen"" does everyone die. My reading of this tale is that everyone dies because, well...everyone dies. What I mean is, all people (in real life) eventually die. And we don't have a choice about that. This tale made me think of situations like having a family member or loved one that is terminally ill, take cancer for example. I may want more than anything in the world to help my family member. Like the Cock, I may try my hardest to find a way to restore my loved one to health, but in the end, it may come to naught. It is a harsh reality being presented here. Sometimes you can try to help, but it doesn't always work. Your ""Hen"" may die, regardless of your good intentions. And eventually, you will too. And so will everyone else you know. Lessons in facing and accepting our own mortality.  Sorry to be so pessimistic. I think it is appropriate in the context of this tale though.  ;You might be on to something Sean. I'm sure the The Thirty Years War had a huge impact on some of these tales. Although, the Grimm Brothers weren't writing them down until the early 19th century, it is said many of the tales came from the 17th century (as you've pointed out, the time of the Thirty Years War). About a hundred years before this (1500's), was the Protestant Reformation. I noticed a few explicit references to Christianity in some of the tales, and not so much in others. But I was wondering the same thing. I think there are threads in these that could certainly be teased out - the old ways (paganism) vs. Christianity. Also, Catholicism vs. Protestantism. Not just in this tale, but in several others as well.  ;This is a great point Khriss. Peer reviews should focus on the task at hand, does this essay ""enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course""? I know as I do my peer reviews, this is the question I will have in mind, not whether I happen to agree with the views of my course mate writing the essay, but rather, if he or she has written a piece that enriches the reading of fellow students in some way.   ;Yes, excellent point Sean. I feel ya. Personally speaking, I love my own ideas to be challenged, to be pushed beyond my limits and boundaries, to experience views from a completely different perspective then what I normally hold. This is one of the reasons I love the humanities so much. This is one of the reasons I enrolled in this course. From some time spent browsing around the forum, it seems I will not be disappointed! I can't wait to read other course mates essays, and start writing my own. Cheers.  ;I've submitted my essay as well, and am looking forward to seeing peer reviews of my work. I agree it was difficult to restrict the writing to the specified word count, but this did force me to try to be as concise as possible. I have been keeping a ""Reader's Journal"" which has been helpful. As I read the texts, I will keep notes and also do some free writing, to reflect on what impressed me from the readings, etc. My notes from the Grimm's Tales are about 5 pages long (in an Open Office document). When it came time to draft the essay, I went back to my Reader's Journal and found several themes that I could have explored. I chose one, crafted a thesis statement and then wrote the essay. I think my first essay we OK, but I'm hoping to improve as we go along. Cheers, and best wishes on your assignments. I look forward to reading the essays I get for peer review tomorrow.  ;I propose that one of the themes from the Grimm tales that is still alive and well today is the use of trickery and/or deceit to gain advantage over another, or to get out of a pending conflict. You see this again and again in these tales, held up almost as if it were a virtue. Often a conflict is set up and then resolved via trickery. Think of Clever Grethel (""...why has he gone and run away with my pair of fowls that I had just dished up.""), that she had, in fact, just feasted on. Think of The Bremen Town Musicians, where the animals tricked the robbers into thinking they were some kind of goblin so they could stay in the house and eat the food. Think of The Gallant Tailor  with his ""seven at one blow"". Perhaps there is a fine line between deceit and cleverness? In any case, I think this theme of outwitting another, gaining an advantage, being quick on your feet (so to speak) is just as popular today as it was when the Grimm brothers were writing.  ;Justin, you can think of different patterns you see repeating in the tales. For instance, step-mothers, princesses, kings, talking animals, ventures into the dark forest, trickery and deceit, marriage, gold, etc. Identify a theme or pattern that interests you and then re-read a few of the tales to see how this theme/pattern is employed. Think about what it might represent on a symbolic level, not just a literal level. This might help in generating ideas for your essay. Best of luck.  ;In this podcast, Dr. Allan Hunter, author of Princes, Frogs and Ugly Sisters: The Healing Power of the Grimm Brother's Tales interprets many of the tales in terms of therapeutic psychological archetypes and motifs. An interesting perspective.  ;Hey Mark,Along with all of the awesome suggestions other course mates have made, maybe it will help to also review your notes, pick one idea that really stands out, and then craft a thesis statement from that. Once you have your thesis statement, then essentially all you need to do is support it in the body of your essay. (see link for help on thesis statements).  ;For future reference, here is the link for the course calendar. It shows the dates and times for each assignment. The times given are in EST, so you will have to convert to your local time. You may also want to print out and/or just read over, the work expectations page. It has a lot of solid information in there. Just one example, it answers your question regarding if you have to complete all essays to get a Statement of Accomplishment in this class (you do not, but read the details for more info)As an aside, I want to say it is heartening to see so many course mates jump on this thread to offer suggestions, feedback and encouragement to Mark, and to each other. Bravo!  ;Understood Mark, and an easy mistake to make. In fact, I did something similar in my very first MOOC. The bright side is, in a MOOC, the student base is truly international, so while we might on occasion struggle with properly calculating time zones, etc., we have the great benefit of interacting with people from all over the world, any time of the day or night. I love this aspect! No matter what type of hours you keep, if you log into the forum, there are bound to be other course mates logged in at that time as well (no matter what time it is locally to you). I happen to keep late hours, but this does not preclude me from having near live interaction in the forum.  Sorry to hear you missed the first deadline. It sounds like you have that figured out now. Cheers;While it might be considered a controversial idea to think of one of the world's greatest authors in this light, you are not alone in speculating about this Javier. For just one example, see this article in the Guardian.  ;Here is a thought experiment to consider. Let's say today, some unknown author, someone you never heard of, a single white male in his 30's, spent a great deal of his time hanging around 7 to 10 year old girls, taking photos of them half naked, writing them letters saying things like ""Extra thanks and kisses for the lock of hair. I have kissed it several times - for want of having you to kiss, you know, even hair is better than nothing."" (a real quote from Lewis Carroll to a 10 year old ""child friend"" of his), telling one of his adult friends that ""I confess I do not admire naked boys in pictures. They always seem... to need clothes, whereas one hardly sees why the lovely forms of girls should ever be covered up."", laying awake at night, unable to go to sleep after having spent the day with his favorite ""child friend"", and throwing himself into the study of mathematics in the hope of ridding himself from ""unholy thoughts, which torture with their hateful presence, the fancy that would fain be pure"".I bet if these things were revealed about some unknown author today, we would see a trial, or a mob at his house or something similar.  Carroll's own sister even questioned him in a letter in 1893, to which he replied ""I do like getting such letters as yours. I think all you say about my girl-guests is most kind and sisterly ... But I don't think it at all advisable to any controversy about it."", further adding that he does not care for the opinion of others, and is only concerned with his own conscience.I'm just saying, there seems to be something more here than just being friendly with girls in the way an uncle or grandfather might be. I don't claim Carroll ever acted on it, but it is hard for me to just dismiss the issue as an unfounded claim, regardless of how much I love his writing.   This is such a taboo topic today that it is difficult for many to really analyse it objectively. Folks tend to either dismiss it as ridiculous slander or make accusations without any facts. The emotional response is the typical response, one way or another. I feel the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. I think Carroll had desires for young girls, found this problematic, and didn't act on it in any kind of physical way, but that doesn't mean he was completely innocent in his thoughts.  What does this have to do with our assignments or this class? I would say, since we are to do a ""close reading"" of the text, this might be something to keep in mind, the same way that knowing the history of what was happening in Germany when the Grimm Brother's were collecting their tales might be relevant to understanding the text, regardless of your position on the issue.  ;Hi all,So I was searching around on some of the site resources and found this really awesome podcast of Prof. Rabkin on the SFF podcast show. Very insightful. Click on the link and when you get to the page, scroll down until you see the play button (alternatively there is an audio mp3 link, where you can download the podcast directly).;I'm a Dali fan. I saw an exhibit of his late work at a local art museum in 2010. Thanks for sharing.  ;"
False,St2,Coh1,0.42857142857142855,1,0,0.72,0.0448033,0.422901053,0.4,0.066666667,0.25,0.254237275,0.522041775,"Tan,Yes, it can be difficult when considering an entire novel to settle on one aspect of it to write a short essay. My best advice is to keep a notebook (or word file) handy as you read, and to simply jot down themes that really speak to you in the text. You may have a long list, or a short list. It doesn't really matter. Just note down items of interest. Then, when you are done reading, you can go back to your notes and choose one theme, and start brainstorming for your essay. Something to keep in mind that might help...none of us in this course are going to write an essay that covers the entire novel. All of us are, in one way or another, going to pick out something that we like, or dislike about the text, or something that provoked further thought about the text, and write about that. The beauty is, there will be a great diversity of views. This is to be encouraged. Cheers.;First, I really respect my fellow course mates who are not native English speakers taking this course. I can imagine how difficult that might be. When I review an essay and it appears to me that the writer does not have English as his or her first language, I do take that into consideration, and I try to be as helpful as possible. That said, when I look at the rubric for the essays, the section on Form says,""Please indicate in 30-150 words your judgment of the FORM of the essay you have just read.   FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure. Are the sentences grammatically correct?   Are the words properly used?   Is the exposition and argument laid out clearly?   An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.""If grammar, usage and structure are poorly done, if the exposition and/or argument is not clear, etc. the grade will reflect that for this section. I will, of course, comment on both strengths and weaknesses. I will also offer examples as suggestions for improvement.  If I was to, say, take one of the courses that are conducted in Spanish, I would expect my grades to reflect how well I write in Spanish rather than my native tongue. I would want to know where I made mistakes and where I was correct, so that my Spanish could improve. I wouldn't want my course mates to hide my mistakes out of a concern for hurting my feelings. I am here to learn, not to get a certain grade (if that makes sense).There is, however, a level of sensitivity that should be expected. Constructive criticism should be the goal in my humble opinion.  ;Yes, I was definitely hooked. Of course, coming from my culture, the story and characters are all very familiar to me ( I live in the US). Where was I hooked? I was hooked when Alice decided to go down the rabbit hole. I'm a sucker for a good adventure. I wanted to follow her along as well. What's down there? Let's go see! :) After the initial hook, my interest was sustained by the dialog. I love the paradox and contradictions. Especially how meanings that are often just taken for granted are questioned and deconstructed in some of the dialog. I've heard lots of people refer to the dialog as ""nonsense"". I have to disagree, it is not nonsensical at all (except possbily in a few places). For instance, think of the dialog between Alice and the Caterpillar (in Chapter 5). The question ""Who are you?"" is, in fact, very profound. It may seem like nonsense to some, but I would say, go a little deeper than the surface level and you will see there is a wealth of meaning here. Have you ever stopped and asked yourself who you are? If you haven't, you should try it sometime, and see where it leads.  Cheers!;You are quite welcome Anahita! I am grateful for the forum where we can all discuss our thoughts about these works. I'm more than happy to join in on the conversation. Thank you for starting the thread. :);The power of an image is strong. The actual text being referred to is from Chapter 5 of Through the Looking-Glass. Here is the quote:""So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep, to get hold of the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off     and for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water     while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.""No mention of ""golden"" hair, just tangled hair. It must have been Sir John Tenniel who made Alice a blonde? Unless there is another reference somewhere that I have missed?  UPDATE: Then again, Tenniel's illustrations are in black and white, though on the cover of my book, one of them is colored in, and shows Alice as a blonde. Not sure if the originals were colored at all? The rest in the actual text of the book are black and white.  The ""real"" Alice (Alice Liddell, who Carroll based the character on) was a brunette.  ;No worries Joanna. :) I think it makes a valid point though, the influence of illustrations and later, film adaptations, leave strong imprints on us (myself included). I always think of Alice as a blonde.  I would like to find out when Tenniel's illustrations were colored, and if he did that himself, or if it was somebody else. Also, if the colored illustrations precede the films. Google-fu activate! lol.  ;This is an excellent point Daniel. The author really employs his craft to get the reader to experience a lot of the same confusion and frustration Alice feels in the story, no?  ;Frazer is an excellent source. I would also add Joseph Campbell's  Masks of God series, and several books by Mircea Eliade.  ;Hello Greg,I am not (yet) a published author, but I am working in that direction. This year I promised myself to focus more on my writing. When I discovered Coursera, I immediately signed up for as many humanities courses as I could find. This course was on the top of the list. So, here I am. :)So far I've found that there is a great wealth of knowledge and inspiration in the texts we are reading. Like you, I intend on getting as much out of this course as I can, really digging in to the stories, and then drawing from them in various way in my own writing. The essay writing, peer reviews (both giving and receiving them), and the forum are all excellent tools to provoke a deeper exploration of the texts. I'm here. I'm on board. Thanks for starting this thread.    ;At present I am in the planning stages of a novel. In terms of genre, I guess ""speculative fiction"" is probably the closest label I would be comfortable with. Some of my biggest influences are Robert Anton Wilson, Philip K. Dick, and (an older one) Hermann Hesse (though there are tons more).;Rumpelstiltskin is one of my favorite Grimm's Tales. I can envision a re-telling of the story with a somewhat ""occult"" or ""supernatural"" flavor to it. It has many of the elements already (i.e. promising your first born child, a strange ""little man"" that acts as a trickster character, the magic of having to learn his name, since there is an old occult principle that if you know the name of a demon, you can wield power over it, etc.)  ;Hello Elena,This is interesting. You wrote:""The problem is WHY we are still repeating this patterns.And, yes the answer: it is all about ancient rituals.""I have never read Propp. My first introduction to him was from the clip where Prof. Rabkin mentions him. I do find his theories interesting enough for me to look further into his work. You mentioned that you have studied his work. Is what you write above about the stories being based on ancient rituals Propp's contention, or your own? Pardon my ignorance of Propp's theories beyond just a very basic overview at this point. :)  ;You're on to something here Elena. Bluebeard is totally a serial killer! Society just didn't use that term back then.  ;Greetings course mates,If you have read the stories and are looking to delve in a bit deeper, you might consider watching these two film adaptations of  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (see links below).Alice - Director Jan Svankmajer (1988).  A very  avant garde,    surrealistic  interpretation of the story.Alice in Wonderland - Director Jonathan Miller (1966).  An interesting take on the story, produced as a TV play (for BBC). The characters are all dressed in standard Victorian style clothing (including the creatures, like the White Rabbit, Mock Turtle, etc.).  ;Thank you for the comments Ishan. My personal preference is the actual book. That said, after reading the book, I do tend to seek out various interpretations/adaptations on film just to see the stories in another medium. I rather like Svankmajer's version, though I realize for many it may come across as a bit too surreal. The same director also did an adaptation of the Faust tale, which is equally obscure, though I rather enjoyed it after having read Goethe's Faust and Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus. Believe it or not, I have yet to see Burton's Alice in Wonderland. I plan on checking it out, eventually. And re-reading Carroll's stories again later. I tend to return to certain books again and again.  ;Director Jan Svankmajer's 1988 film Alice (Czech title,  N  co z Alenky),incorporates live-action, puppetry, and stop-motion/claymation. That doesn't mean you can't do a version as well (you should do it!). Besides, Svankmajer's film is not 100% claymation by any means. It is really a very surreal film, worth a look IMHO. Not for everyone though, quite avant garde.  ;You're welcome Amelia. I encourage you to explore your idea. I think Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking-Glass would make an excellent claymation film. Cheers.;I really think you have hit on to something insightful here John--the idea that the ""paranormal"" or ""occult"" is often overlooked or dismissed due to cultural conditioning or a prevailing rationalist world-view. If you think of the time period when this book was written (the late 19th century) and the place (Europe) you will see that this was a theme being explored in great detail. There was a definite shift from the ""old ways"" (i.e. folk-traditions, religion, etc.) towards a scientific/empirical approach during the previous Age of Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries). During the late 18th century there was a reaction against this in some of the literature and arts, often termed the Romantic period (a few examples are Lord Byron, Percy and Mary Shelly, John William Polidori, et al). Dracula seems to be informed by the Romantic period to an extent. Also, in Europe at the time Stoker was writing (i.e. the late 19th century) there was an ""occult revival"" taking place that carried into the beginning of the next century. See, for example, the formation of the Theosophical Society in 1875 and the formation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1887. These themes were prevalent in society, even outside of the realm of literature.  ;"

I have been copy and pasting the essays into my word processor, printing them out, and reading all of them very carefully. I make notations and comments on the print out for my own self reference, and then after reading and making these comments on all the hard-copies I will type up my comments and grades for each section for each essay into a file in my word processor. Finally I will copy and paste the comments and grades into the site for each essay. For me, comments really matter. I know when I receive constructive comments and suggestions it helps me greatly, so I try to do the same for each essay I review.I was amazed this time around. I got really great marks. I actually thought my essay for the last unit was better and was concerned about this unit. However, last unit I got a 4 (which I was happy with) and this unit I got a 6 (which took me by surprise). The comments help me know what folks liked about the essay, and also some areas that could be improved upon. Thanks to all who reviewed my work (whoever you are).  P.S. perhaps a little wine AFTER the reviews is called for though. :P;Anon, I love your thesis, and you supported your argument in a very clear and logical manner. Your essay most certainly enriches my reading of the text. Great work.  ;I was surprised that I received a 6, but very thankful for it. I also want to thank my fellow-students for peer reviewing my work, and offering such helpful and thoughtful comments. Here is my essay for Unit 2 that scored a ""6"".Questions of Identity      Who are  you?    said the Caterpillar (p. 46), succinctly encapsulating one of the recurring themes of    Alice's  Adventures in Wonderland. This story is replete with questions of identity.    I hardly know, sir...    replies Alice, thereby confirming her confusion about who she is.    Who are you?    seems like such a simple question, and yet, upon further reflection, it is quite profound. Again and again this question of identity arises in the story in various forms.   In Chapter 1 (Adventures)  the narrator tells us,    ...this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.    indicating that Alice already had a predilection towards a fluid self-image, even prior to entering Wonderland. After giving herself advice (i.e. talking to herself as if she were another person), Alice subsequently argues against her imaginary self, commenting that    there's hardly enough of me left to make  one  respectable person!    In Chapter 2 (Adventures), Alice muses,    Who in the world am I?   , replying with    Ah, that's the great puzzle!    as she then  proceeds to consider in a long dialog (again with herself) if she is perhaps Ada, or Mable. This is the great puzzle for Alice, yet I also feel Lewis Carroll is telling us this is the great puzzle for us as well. Under the guise of an innocent child's story, the author is asking some probing philosophical questions. As we follow the adventures of Alice in Wonderland, we are also following a personal quest of our own. Carroll is asking us not to take our own lives for granted. He is telling us things are not always as they appear to be. He is challenging us to step back for a moment and ask ourselves who we really are. Deep down, who are you? Do you  really  know?  [304 words];Thank you for the kind comments Anon. At first I was going to show examples from both Adventures and Through the Looking-Glass. Though once I started writing, it became evident that I wouldn't be able to keep it within the required word count, so I stuck with just the first story where this theme is most prominent (according to my own reading of it). That said, I think it would be interesting to explore the same theme in Through the Looking-Glass as well.  I have a blog on wordpress. I think once this course is over I am going to go back to each of my essays and revise them, perhaps expand them as well, and post them to the blog as a series. I will, of course, give credit back to this class. :) Perhaps other students might want their essay's posted on the blog as well? I will start a thread when it is closer to the end of the course to see if there is interest. It might be a fun project to do when this awesome class is done and gone. I have found the peer review process (both giving and receiving) in this course (and others I have taken) helps with my own writing, especially when it comes to revising a draft.  Cheers!;To Anna, Jae, Pallavi and Katy,Thank you all so much for the kind words. Apologies for the long delay in responding. I have been out of town since Friday the 21st. I went to visit New Orleans (in Louisiana, USA) and didn't get back until recently. Unfortunately this means I missed the essay deadline for Dracula. I am upset about that, but will press on with Frankenstein. I have read Dracula in the past, but have been re-reading it for this course. However, the holiday put me behind. I am going to start reading Frankenstein now and taking notes for ideas about my essay for that. I will probably also re-visit Dracula when the course is over and write an essay about it for my own purposes.The word count limit has been serving as an exercise in writing concisely, attempting to pull concepts together in a few words, something I struggle with at times.  Thanks again to all who commented for the very encouraging words about my essay. I wish everyone the best with your own work.  ;Mary, that sounds wonderful. I love how you incorporated the Descent of Ishtar motif into your story. One of my personal hobbies, you might say, is the study of comparative mythology and religion. There are a vast amount of narratives from different times and cultures floating around in my head. As an aspiring novelist, I feel that I will be incorporating some of these in one form or another into my stories. You have given me encouragement to pursue this. Thank you for that. :);Hello Teish,It's great to hear what you are doing. I think this is wonderful. I'll take a look at your website. Best wishes in your writing endeavors and in this course.  ;Thinking this out leads me to wonder if part of the subtext of Dracula is a question of what is reality. Is Stoker implying that what we consider reality is probably just one aspect of that reality but that there are more levels and layers of reality?I think this is very insightful DaveN. Thanks for sharing.  ;Great advice Megan!;"

This is one of the things I love about the humanities in general. There is no one correct interpretation (including, I would argue, the interpretation of the author). Like any form of art (and a good novel is a form of art, so is dance, music, painting, sculpture, etc.), there is more to it then initially meets the eye.  Where would the world be if everything was simply black or white, true or false, correct or incorrect? What about imagination and creativity? If a text can provoke thought, debate and engaging dialog, in addition to entertainment, that is saying something IMHO.  As any creative artist knows, your art is never truly just ""your"" art. Rather, it is like a child you birth, it has a life of it's own, and the way others interact with it is part of the artistic process.  ;So far I've had fairly decent success with the peer review process. Some reviews are certainly more helpful than others, but that is just how it goes. That said, even the ""bad"" reviews have been helpful to me in the sense that I am receiving some kind of feedback from someone other than myself about my writing. If you ever publish your writing, for example, you are sending it out in the world for anyone to read, critique, and interpret however they want. Some of the public will have insightful views of your work, some of the public will not. The peer review process in this course might be thought of as a sample of that type of reaction. If someone completely misunderstands what you are trying to say, that says something in itself. How could I have written this better so more people can easily understand what I am trying to communicate? If someone simply just doesn't take the time, and that is obvious, that is a different story. However, no sweat off my brow, I move on to the next review and look for the gems.  In addition to all of the above, I can say that by doing peer-reviews myself in a careful and thoughtful manner, not only am I offering some solid feedback to my peers, but I am also improving my own writing. Doing reviews improves your own writing process as it sharpens and hones your skills. It's a win/win situation for me.  ;I'll come out of the silence to say I love Frankenstein as well. And not only the story, but even how it was written. I happen to read a lot of literature from several different periods, including the 19th century, so the prose was not uncommon for me. Perhaps that helped.  For this course, I read Frankenstein in two days. I would have read it all the way through in one, but I was visiting with a friend when I started it and thought it would be rude of me to ignore her to read 166 pages while I was supposed to be hanging out. :) So I basically read about 20 pages that night. Then the following night, while at home by myself, I read the rest of the way through.  There are so many themes going on in this book. It kept me engaged. I love the romantic period in general, the disrupting of a traditional worldview, the questions of where science might lead us (including how it can be very problematic), references to the alchemists (Agrippa, Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus), the whole back-story of how this story came about even.  No, it's not sword and sorcery, nor is it space opera, but...so what? Those genres have merit in their own way, but this book has stood the test of time. At 195 years and still going, that can't be denied.  ;I agree Alejandro. I feel that the ambiguity of the characters (especially Victor and the creature) is one of the elements that makes this story so interesting. There are no clear ""good guys and bad guys"" (heroes and villains).  There are things about Victor I really like--his desire for knowledge, his devotion to his work, his love for his family (though he fails in this). There are things about Victor I despise--his pettiness, his selfishness, his immediate abandonment of the creatue, his self-loathing, etc.  The same for the creature, there are things I really like about the creature--his struggle for humanity, his inventiveness in how he learns to read and write, his sentiments for the De Lacey family, etc. Of course, the murders the creature does are not excusable, but as you say, it is complex, we can understand perhaps why he did them even if we don't agree with them (the abandonment, the loneliness, the treatment every human ever gave him that he encountered, etc).  Life itself is typically a lot like this, really messy, no clear right and wrong, multiple facets have to be considered, etc. At 18, Mary Shelley already experienced a lot more of life--including liberating freedoms as well as devastating tragedies--than what an 18 year old of our (post) modern era might typically experience. This comes through in the novel for me.  ;Sex and power video? Sounds like I'm missing something interesting. lol.  ;In addition to Prof. Rabkin's excellent videos for this unit, here is a very insightful interpretation of Frankenstein by Prof. Anne K. Mellor, called Mothering Monsters.  The gist of her interpretation is that Shelley was exploring what it would be like for a man to birth a child. The obvious answer (based on Mellor's take of this story) is that it would be disastrous, a monstrosity. There is more to it then this, but you should listen to the presentation to hear it for yourself.  ;"

Not only has it allowed me to practice my own writing (via the essays), but it has also allowed me to consider many different views about the texts, both from my own readings, but also from our fellow course mates (by peer reviewing essays as well as browsing around the forums). And of course, the ""cherry on top"" of all of this is the insight our Professor shares from his videos.  Without all of these components, this would simply be a course to encourage people to read and leave it at that. The analysis part is what makes it so much more.  ;Thanks for your comments Mary. I agree with you completely. Looking ahead towards submitting chapter summaries and so forth to publishers, I feel the essays in this course--with the limited word count--are really forcing me to write more succinctly. It is a wonderful exercise!  The peer review process (on the receiving end) is softening me up for critique, feedback, and even the inevitable rejection slips that any author has to endure until one day, miracle of miracles, they actually get PUBLISHED. :)  Thanks again for the feedback, and the advice.  ;Excellent Georgy! I'm happy to hear you are staying enrolled. I agree, part of the benefit of this course (arguably, the most important benefit) is the knowledge we attain through the readings, discussions, videos and peer reviews. The certificate is secondary to all of this (though it would be nice to have as well, when all is said and done).  ;I agree with your comments here Joanna. I totally see why we have started with Grimm's Tales, Alice, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. These stories are essential to what came after them in the genres of Fantasy and Science Fiction. This may not be evident at first glance, but with close readings of the text, it becomes obvious (to me, at least). These texts were all pioneers in the field.  ;Yes, I see it now. Thank you. This was for Unit 3 - Dracula. The thread is posted under Unit 4 - Frankenstein. That was confusing me a bit The video must have been released after the first batch of them. I download all the videos and didn't have this one, but since going back and checking each unit, I found the video in question. Thanks for pointing this out.I see the dog (on the couch, behind our Professor). Very cute!;You're welcome Mary. I'm glad you enjoyed it!;Javier,I think the main point    Prof. Anne K. Mellor was trying to argue in her presentation was that going against nature tends to have  disastrous  effects. Only a woman can get pregnant, support life from her own body, and birth another human. A man does not have this capability (whether we consider this limitation as being due simply to biology or to divine law might be another interesting theme to explore, but beyond the scope of this post). I understand what you are saying here, that all humans have been born of women, that there have been some monstrous people in the past, so it follows that woman sometimes ""produce monsters"". However,  I don't think Mellor was trying to argue that if a person is born from a woman, he or she would therefore necessarily be good and  virtuous   I do think she was trying to argue that Mary Shelley might have been exploring the theme of an ""unnatural  creation"", the birthing of a creature by a man with no woman involved, a kind of   mockery of natural birth, and commenting on its disastrous  results.  ;That seems like a decent theme to explore Anon. There are threads in the forum where people are posting their essays to be reviewed beyond the ""official"" reviews we get during the unit. I'm on my way out the door, so unfortunately I do not have time to track down the specific links for you, but if you search the forum, you should find similar threads for each unit. Perhaps you will consider posting your essay to one of those threads for further review?;Greetings course mates,Is anyone out there considering revising your essays based on feedback from the peer reviews? The workload of this course is high, with the weekly readings, essay writing, and peer reviews, so I probably won't do any revisions until the end of the course, yet I am planning on doing revisions. I have a blog on Wordpress and will eventually post my revised essays there as part of a series on this course.Anybody else planning on doing something similar? I'd love to read your revised essays. I would even consider having you as a quest blogger on my blog and/or posting your essays there as well. Let me know if you are interested and we can stay in contact beyond this course.;Thanks Anonymous. I need to write more on the blog. This class is taking up a lot of my time with the readings and such, but I'm loving it. When it's over, I should be able to focus more on the blog (as well as having some material to revise and make a series of posts about). :PAlejandro, I like your blog. I'm going to follow it.  ;Thank you Alejandro. That article on Guatemala was written as one of my assignments in another course (Rhetorical Composing). I chose the topic myself. The assignment was  to compose a text intended for a public audience in which we engage an issue that we find worthwhile.  I was already familiar with the terrible tragedies done to the Ixil peoples from news reports on the Rios Montt trial and also from a friend in Mexico that sent me a documentary about the Maya. As I investigated further, I found many more sources to use. I eventually want to write a follow up article as well, as things further develop.I am in the US, but I have several online friends from Central and South America. I try to stay aware of things happening around the world, not just my own country. I also try to frequent alternative news sources (like Democracy Now!, for example), not just Fox and CNN. The internet makes it easier to have a broader view IMHO.  ;Florencia, I think it will be a great exercise for me to revise (and perhaps expand) the essays when the course is over. Good luck with yours, if you do it.Awesome Tegan. I will check out your blog. Thanks for sharing the link. I completely understand; the work load is heavy in this course. I won't be doing any revising until we are done here either. Yet, I definitely want to revise and expand on the essays, as well as writing additional essays for other books I read. For the last 7 or 8 years my reading has been mostly non-fiction on topics of interest to me. This course has reminded me of my first love, fiction/literature. My already ridiculously long ""to read"" list has grown exponentially longer now that I am exploring fiction titles again.;Tegan, that's funny! Bibliophiles like ourselves tend to have that never-ending-always-expanding reading list, no? I own more books than I do clothes (true story!).I gather from your blog that you are a librarian? Three cheers for all the libraries (and librarians) out there! Growing up, I discovered whole new worlds when my mom first took me to the library. It has been a love affair between me and books ever since.  Well, I hope you were able to get through the recommend readings for this unit, and write your essay, Advanced Reader Copy notwithstanding. ;);Olga, if you continue to have difficulties, you might consider trying OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Word. This is a free, open source office program that has a word processor and other apps in the suite as well. You can download it here.  I write my essays in OpenOffice, then copy and paste into the Coursera site, and haven't had any trouble with formatting, etc.Best of luck. Let us know if it keeps happening.  ;I think John is correct here. Though it is not commonly used this way now, it appears Hawthorne is using ""proficient"" in this sentence as a noun rather than an adjective. If this is so, then ""an eminent proficient..."" would mean something similar to John's rewording of ""an eminent expert..."";This is great Megan! Thanks for sharing that gem from Aaron Sorkin. I loved hearing how active he is when he writes (i.e. jumping up and down from his desk, etc.). His best advice, in my humble opinion, is the most obvious bit he offers at the very end of the note, ""Write the way you write"".  As for me, I used to use music as a background but that changed about 10 years ago or thereabouts. I love music just as much as poetry and literature, so when I play music I often lose myself in it, or find myself focusing on both the sounds and the lyrics, immersing myself in it all, being caught up in the specific emotions and/or memories any particular song might happen to evoke for me. Therefor, in regards to my own writing process, music actually becomes a distraction more often than not. I can't focus on writing because I am engulfed in the music, especially if the songs have lyrics. That said, if I am feeling uninspired I might take a break from writing and play some music, then go back to writing. Or I might take a walk in the woods, or visit a friend, or meditate. When I am writing, I work at my desk on a word-processor. Often it is in the middle of the night, when all is quiet except for the crickets (or rain, if it's raining. I love when it's raining! I keep the windows open, listen to the rain fall, smell the fresh air--very inspiring for me). The quieter it is in my room, the better. My mind drifts towards the story (or whatever I happen to be writing about). I alternate between writing, outlining, fleshing out ideas in my notebook and short breaks for something to drink and/or eat, play with my cat, then back to more writing. I always have to have a pack of cigarettes nearby as well. Horrible habit, I know, but yes, I am a smoker, and find that when I am writing, I smoke more.  Oh, and on your comment that ""Redundancy is a writer's best friend in a technology driven world"", I couldn't agree more. Horror of horrors, back in 2000 I wrote a series of short-stories that I was really happy with. I hadn't been writing for several years and these were the first ones to come through for me after a long pause. I wrote them all out in my word processor and then had a hard drive crash. I never had them backed up. I lost them all! Whoosh! Gone. Ever since, I make sure I back up my data, especially my writing folders. It took me a while to recover from that blow, to begin to think about writing again. It was, of course, my own damn fault for not backing them up, but that didn't make it any easier.  ;You didn't do anything silly Frederico. The selected readings for Unit 5 are on Hawthorne and Poe. You can write your essay on either of them, or both of them.  ;"

And within each country, there are many different dialects/accents and peculiar turns of phrase that differ region to region. English has become the lingua franca of our modern world. It has many forms, and has been adapted to local flavor wherever it has been taken up. This should be kept in mind when marking papers.  I would never personally mark down a paper for using proper English (whether American, British, or some other form).

I agree though, in the context of this course, it would be problematic to do this before the deadline for the reasons you list. Two possible suggestions I can think of are:1) create a study group on another platform (like Google Plus, Facebook, or an email list) and share drafts there for critique, feedback, suggestions, discussion, etc.2) stagger the revisions to be done after the deadline. This would still facilitate a means to revise essays, but would not effect the grade in this course (unless, perhaps, you take it a second time).;I have been reading since I was a child. Actually, my mom tells me she read to me even before I was born. It has been a love affair with books ever since. Early interests came from the genres of Fantasy, Horror and Science Fiction (I also love a lot of classic literature, but will skip that for this post as being possibly off topic).  Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man and Something Wicked This Way Comes, Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed, Stephen King's short story collection Night Shift, Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, Philip K. Dick's VALIS trilogy, R. A. Salvatore's Dark Elf trilogy, Piers Anthony's Xanth series and later his Tarot series, Andre Norton's Fur Magic,  Robert Anton Wilson's The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles, Neil Gaiman's  America Gods, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Frank Herbert's Dune series, Robert Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, H.P. Lovecraft's The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath...these, and so many other authors/books, have all been highly influential in my life, both as a reader and also as a writer.  ;This is an excellent essay Jeremy. I, for one, enjoy focused topics, especially so in these short essays. While I do think it is possible to include multiple themes, it takes great skill to pull that off in 320 words. A tight thesis, with supporting textual evidence, tends to make for a great short essay. You have done just that IMHO. Your examination of the unreliable narrator was insightful. You make me want to go back and re-read the text as I didn't pick this up the first time around. Bravo!;The Masque of the Red Death  seems to have been a popular story to include in the essays for this unit, even though it is not on the syllabus. I'll add my name to the list of reviewers here that received an essay on the Red Death. In this case, the student compared the Red Death with a Hawthorne story (that was on the reading list). I was torn with how to mark the essay. It was well written, intelligent, the thesis was argued well (and supported with examples from the texts), it was an original idea, BUT...half of the essay was based on a story we were not assigned!  Fellow students, please read the syllabus. It lists all the stories we are supposed to be reading. I would have loved to do an essay on the Red Death as well (one of my favorite Poe stories), but I didn't, because it is not part of the curriculum.  ;You had me thinking Paul. I just ran a plagiarism check on one of the essays I received, but...it turned up legit. I'm glad it did actually. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt, but understand that not everyone out there plays fair. :/;Javier, I like your theme. I also like how you brought in details from Poe's life. One thing I think that may have improved your essay is if you cited specific examples from one or more of the stories to support your thesis. While you do mention The Black Cat as well as The Tell-Tale Heart,  perhaps you could have included direct quotes from these stories to support your thesis rather than summarizing in your own words. Just a suggestion. Also, did you include an entry in the Works cited section, for where you got your info about Poe?  This theme of Death makes me think of the following song from Blue Oyster Cult, (Don't Fear) The Reaper. :)  ;Indeed, more cowbell! LOL.;Hi Anon,This is an interesting analysis of The Black Cat. I particularly liked your treatment of color symbolism in the text, and noting the reference to mythology (the cat being named Pluto, and how that is significant). You might consider deciding on an interpretation and sticking with it to strengthen your argument. In the essay, you appear to propose several different interpretations (especially in the conclusion). This can give the impression that you are not really sure which interpretation makes the most sense to you. If you decide on one, and then follow up in your essay with supporting evidence for it, this might improve the overall effect of your analysis.  As peer 1 mentioned under form, there are some errors with language, wording, grammar, etc. Not enough that I couldn't follow your ideas though. Yet here are some suggestions that may be helpful for you (suggestions are in bold):""The novel  Black cat  has associations with demons and witchcraft; and  makes you question where the origins of evil dwell.""""Cats, especially black  ones,...""""...while changing a  person   s character.""""...whilst  a [or  the]  devil is nourished with evil deeds,  the  pet is affectionate to its owner, but once it is offended,  it  sets fire in the house.""""...that  man himself was transforming into  a [or  the]    devil,...""""This transformation required bigger sins      the  murder of loved ones, which started with Pluto.""""Taking out an eye can be associated to the cat   s night vision, which is symbolic of  seeing a  world of impurities. This  intimidates the  main character so  that his evil side might be detected.""""...the cat has a  clear relation with the wife.""""The second cat has a  spot on it's fur,...""""...and the  wife   s white hair is  reminiscent  of this, provoking further evilness.""""The white itself is a  ghostly color, or perhaps it is related to purity, and a  sense of the need to taint it.""""Also, the  wife defends the pet with her bare hands against an  axe, and is not offended by the ill- temper of her husband, which raises suspicion that she might have deeper relations to the causes...""""We can consider a  few different conclusions - either the cat is the cause of demonic behavior, the wife is a witch, or the man is at fault.""      ;You're welcome Anon. I know if I was writing in a language other than my primary language, I would like to have suggestions to my form. I applaud you for taking a course like this if English is not your first language. I can only imagine what a challenge that would be for me. Hat's off to you for doing it! :)Regarding my comments about choosing one interpretation, let me clarify a bit. I don't mean to say that you should only stick to one single aspect or view of the text. Yet, the way your essay was written, it comes across as a bit noncommittal. What I mean is, you seem to be saying, ""Well, it could be this, or maybe it's this, or maybe this"" and it gives the impression you aren't really convinced it is any of them. And your reader comes away thinking the same thing (i.e. maybe it's none of these?) That is just how I read it, and I might be totally off the mark here. And I mean no offense. Just offering some friendly feedback for consideration.  Since these essays are so short (320 words), we don't really have a lot of space to flesh out our arguments. It is possible to include several aspects to our interpretations, but these would have to be written very concisely. I don't know, maybe if you tied all three together into a unifying argument somehow, that would have worked well.  Happy reading and writing!;Efthymia, I enjoyed reading your essay. I like the balance you struck between direct quotations from the text and your own analysis. I have to disagree with your peer 3 on this (no offense to peer 3 if you are reading this). Your use of quotatoins is well founded, and blends perfectly with your own ideas. Great job.;Poulomi,This is an interesting feminist critique of these stories, well written and well argued.   Good job.As an aside, is it reverse discrimination to assume the killer in The Tell Tale Heart is a man? lol. Well, probably not because at the time Poe was writing there were very few known reports of women killers, with some rare exceptions (for example,   see Elizabeth Bathory from the 17th century).  ;Thanks for the clarification Greg. I do study identity and gender politics, along with other related disciplines, in my personal readings. I'm certainly no expert, but I try to stay aware of these issues and learn about views and theories surrounding these topics. Deeply ingrained, yes, but thankfully, not necessarily permanent.  ;Brian, not sure what the reviewers were seeing as errors with form. Your sentences flowed well, you had great sentence structure, your ideas were consistent and well articulated, and I found no issues with grammar, spelling or punctuation. Great essay BTW.  ;You were not alone. See this thread for a related dialog about this.  ;I can see how the mistake was made.  I'd love to read your essay anyway Emmanuelle. I'm familiar with The Masque of the Red Death. I love that story! Maybe you will consider posting your essay here for review in addition to the ""formal"" reviews you have already received?  I reviewed an essay for this unit that included this story. I felt it was an excellent essay. I would have awarded a 6, but gave a 5 instead (3 for form, and a 2 for content because of this issue). I've read some people gave 1's because of using stories outside the syllabus. The essay I read was too well written for me to do that in good conscience.  ;"

It's a great pleasure (if not a bit daunting) to see the first posts which such insightful comments.  There also is something quite deep about the idea of, how Theodossi put it, what is real.

Best of luck! ;Hello Carol, I've also read this series (haven't read the fifth one yet no spoilers!) and must agree the authors use of different driving voices for each chapter offers unique perspective.   The author also uses a great way of having facts of the story diluted by each characters perspective, for example: (spoilers!) the dragons returning, most characters seem to take it as pure rumor and myth yet he has shown the reader that it is a fact. Using these types of rumors and perspective gives the reader a fantastic way of truly witnessing what each character experiences whether they be right or wrong. Also his use of morality is interesting. Most of the characters may wish for the world to be black and white but as shown with characters like Cersei Lannister and Catleyn Stark who are similar (mothers, daughters of powerful houses, willing to go to extreme lengths to protect their children) yet also have key differences (beauty, honor, a loving marriage) show the great conflict within the world and that it is all grey. Where one woman is shown to be honorable and trust worthy and the other ruthless and cunning yet both are protecting their children by whatever means (maybe the queen wants to retain her position but honestly, who wouldn't?) Jim ;Dominick, First of what an enlightening post. Well thought out and caused me to pause and contemplate my response. Now that my adulations are out of the way the matter at hand. Martins use of the ""family house"" is a great way to equate the pressures of blind loyalty. If someone is born into something they are inevitably shaped by it. Which is why most people find Arya such a compelling character. She seems to forgo all the family ties (she struggles with this but who wouldn't) and goes on her own, albeit bumpy, path. Someone who doesn't want to be shaped by what she was born into but wants to be who she is. In fact, reflecting on the series as a whole he has  an interesting way of writing female characters. Look at the vast differences between Arya and Sansa, or the queen and Catleyn. Dany and Brienne. All of them strong characters in different ways, it's inspiring. (Even frustrating for an aspiring author). Which lends a bit of lesson to the world that these women are powerful and are shaping the world even if they are looked down upon on their sex. A good point for our modern world to pick up on. ;Exactly! That sort of ambiguity concerning morality is especially rare in fantasy settings where there are tons of mindless evils. Indeed, there is a sort of mindless evil in the white walkers but the true driving force is the characters moral compass being completely understandable and even relatable. How does everyone feel on his use of magic? I love and hate it. It's eluded to and kept away from the reader mostly but, when shown, isn't fully understood and the author seems to be keeping the reader in the dark, almost indefinitely, on the inner workings of the magic of westeros. ;Hmm how interesting. I will have to pick the series up again after this course ends. I did notice he used a good bit of foreshadowing during the scene (spoiler) when Dany entered the house of the undying she witnessed one vision in particular of a man with a wolfs head and a crown upon its brow. And we all know what happened to Robb Stark at the red wedding. I may be forced to reread all four entries now. Thanks a ton! ;"

Anyone else have this issue? ;How unfortunate, the peer reviewing is what makes this class. I appreciate your offer Scott! Here we go:  Edgar Allen Poe filled his poem ""The Raven"" with a myriad of symbols and themes. Perhaps the most powerful imagery is that of the title character sitting atop the bust of Pallas, which in turn is above a door. These symbols represent the dangers of knowledge and the dominance the raven has on the main characters mind.   The importance of knowledge is alluded to in the first several lines while the narrator is ""pondering"" and reading through a ""tome of forgotten lore"". This helps establish that the main character was attempting to learn or gain enlightenment of his own accord, until he is interrupted by the raven.    After the arrival of the raven, it perches itself on the bust of Pallas. Pallas, which is another name for Athena, is the Greek goddess of knowledge. The bird then dominates the scene, resting itself atop a deity that represents knowledge as it lords itself over the narrator. The author uses this to showcase the dominion the raven has over the narrators psyche, for when it enters it is the object of all his focus. Furthermore, the door, which is directly under the bust, could also be a metaphor for the abyss, for when the narrator opens the door and sees that it wasn't a human knocking he is said to peer into darkness and begins    wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;      Consequently, these symbols when pieced together show a rather disturbing image. A man, searching for answers, becomes enraptured by the raven who he thinks has some unseen knowledge. The narrator is thrown into the darkness of the abyss, that was previously outside his chamber, as he falls to the floor under the shadow of Pallas and the raven. Our narrator seeks to understand, to acquire the knowledge, of what ""nevermore"" means and is driven insane over-thinking the infamous quote.

I'd read Perrault's fairy tales recently (before signing up for this course) and it's interesting to see how they differ.   In Perrault's version of The Sleeping Beauty, they don't live happily ever after after she's woken up but the Sleeping Beauty has to contend with a jealous mother-in-law once she's married - I like the tales that break this ""happily ever after"" idea.   I know it's repetitive but I like how there are so many similar stories (like Mother Hulda and The Three Little Men In The Wood), that have obviously been collected from different places but have probably  evolved from an original story, just like nowadays you have the Disney version of fairy tales competing with other versions.   So you think of these Grimms' tales as the original but really they're probably only versions of original stories that were passed down verbally.;"

Now that I think of that, the transfer of oral tradition into the written form might have been really meaningful - if before (grand)parents decided which stories the child was ready to hear based on their maturity and personal qualities, how to narrate and explain them, which details to highlight or omit, what is printed in a book is much closer to being set in stone for anyone to read and draw their independent conclusion.

Never forget the process ;Does anyone else resist the idea of taking notes, in favor of letting the mind wander in the the worlds as one proceeds?   Perhaps especially for these fairy tales, perhaps it is that the reading is done within a few days, but I feel almost like taking notes might be intrusive on my subconscious enjoyment and stirring of ideas.     Of course there are some times I am driven to write something down, but that is usually a result of the stirring, rather than notes for notes sake.I am a little bit procrastinating because of this....I think...conflicted, maybe. I don't want to proceed with the idea that I am ""supposed to take notes"" as opposed to doing it naturally, for my own reasons.  Anyone else?   Or anyone have any thoughts? probably silly altogether. normally I make a lot of notes...signed, conflicted idealist in need of coffee;The Grimm Collection of tales only says that it is that. As Disney takes public domain stories and tells them, the Disney collection is unique, so does the Grimm Brothers, as well as the translators of each edition. None of these  are the verbal versions, and none are the verbal versions that would have been those of any particular person, family, town, or area.It's a collection, the meaning of which is in the grouping itself as well as the content. Imagine in some families one might have heard only the tales such as the Six Soldiers or The Gallant Tailor, where one might aspire to greatness from lowly beginnings, and perhaps not be quite perfectly fair in doing so. In other families one might hear only tales of warning not to be greedy, or other things of value to their own personal history.I am curious to hear Prof Rabkin on the reason for the collection. I am resisting the temptation to look it up, in the spirit of the course syllabus and order of things:)   I imagine that it is quite different from, say Disney Corp's reason for their collection (""buy things! aspire to buy things! Be good, and serve well, and you will be able to buy things!"" (and let's not forget ""brave is good, but also be sexy, girls!"");I've come to think that these tales are more like observations on life and people, like a sociology lesson, or how the world works. Perhaps the character development needed in the locale of each tale, or version, varied, depending on whether ones local king or queen (or local leaders) were kind and generous, or horrid and cruel and to be avoided.   Thus in some stories we see that getting away with what you can is fair enough and one gets away with it, as in   'Six Soldiers of Fortune', as opposed to faithfulness, service and loyalty   to the point of self sacrifice, win the day as in 'Faithful John' , where we might imagine that the local King would have been worthy of supporting to such great lengths, and thus we pass these qualities on as desirable in this location and time.I found myself wondering about what the local civilization was like from story to story, how they might live, what they value, what is acceptable, what is worthy, or not,   given the tale told.;True, although it was that his actions that were morally questionable and still won the day for our Jack-of-all-trades.   So we can assume that what is valued there in the locale and time of this tale,   would be to fight for what is right and deserved at all costs, the ends justifies the means. Not all societies agree that the end justifies the means. There is some greed in our 'hero' in Six Soldiers, for example, as he takes all of the kingdom's gold, that here is acceptable, where in an other story, that might be his downfall.;The story begins with Hans telling his master that he is finished with his seven years, and wants only to go see his mother. He asks for his wages   only so that he can be on his way to her.The value of the gold to the employer shows what he thought of Hans' work, as did his words ""You have served me truly and faithfully,"" and ""as the service is, so must the wages be"". So we see Hans as a worthy character to be admired. If we take that into consideration, then perhaps we can view   that Hans is truly 'in luck' whether he perceives it and we do not, or he perceives it and it is true (or not).   I think it may well be about how 'luck' is things that come along at the right place and right time, and also a matter of perception and character, ones outlook on life.   After all, in Hans' eyes, he enjoyed everything he traded for, and when he began to not enjoy it, he easily found something to exchange it for, bringing him new happiness again.These threads about the stories are fun and thought provoking, I can't wait to read the essays:);I do think that the story's intention is as you say. Otherwise we might have heard at the end of the mothers lament at the loss of the gold. As that is not mentioned, it probably should not be implied, except perhaps in one's own version of the story, when told anew:);I wonder if this point will make a difference to how anyone views Hans- he is not in fact ""quitting his job"", but rather reached the end of his traditionally 7 year long apprenticeship, where one learns a trade and aids their mentor in exchange for food and lodging. Traditionally they would be given something for their service, almost a token of luck, to help them begin their new life working at what they've just apprenticed at.So, Hans did not simply quit and wander on home, it was the end of his term of servitude for the apprenticeship.;It seemed to me that it was a tale of how a lot of   greedy characters and their own self interest will cause a venture to fail.   They were all willing to help in exchange for something before they would help, and in the end they all failed and it was their undoing. You can have as many half-hearts half helping as you wish, but you will all fall to a bad fate if the most important thing is their selfishness.;I agree with Gustavo, using personal feelings to illustrate points can be effective. Especially if you are so driven to share your fear that you are exploring it here on the forums, it may well be relevant and worth writing about. Write it, see it it does enrich the attentive fellow student, and use your judgement. ;As I read through all of the discussions, with good back and forth between everyone on the stories,I see many wonderful thoughts and   opinions, different views of the story or stories that are valuable to the discussion.I am hoping that when we do our peer reviews, we will be open to the views of others, and judge the essays on whether they enrich the readers experience rather than whether or not we agree with the writers assessment.Also, though we are graced with many talented people, including teachers in our midst, I hope that it is remembered that we are not all Doctoral students,teachers, nor perfect in our English.  ;Mark, that is so ironic, your post sounds just like a Grimm story!(does that make you curious?);oh the illustrations are beautiful, and worthy of some attention:) if you can see the copy provided here just for those, do!  ;Thank goodness for this thread!

I had my own idea about the purpose of the tales in general, and that's what I wrote about.

Hard to say :)  There is also the question of brain lesions or abnormal psychology: I'm sure you've heard of painters that may have had neurological issues (like Van Gogh - possibly a driver for 'starry night'). I'm certain that some of the many SF/F greats are likely to have issues like this but I'm no expert.As for the earliest in-depth sex in stories, I'm tempted to say that this would have been pre- written language. There is a lot of sexual stuff in early carving from many cultures; and in cave-paintings. Probably inevitable since food, sex and death drive all animals and were probably some of the first things to emerge as conscious drives, especially within communication :)Others seeing it as subliminal - hmm tricky - others seeing obvious references is easy. Others seeing something that the creator didn't realise was there themselves...hmmm.. Sometimes a banana is just a banana....  That said, a lot of human adornments; and even normal secondary sexual characteristics could be said to be biologically subliminal or indirect; so it might be hard to  separate  unconscious copying of biologically subliminal imagery into artesan vs a deliberate inclusion of manipulative imagery...If you mean that the creator knew (purposeful inclusion) and the reader/viewer didn't  consciously  realise it then I would guess that would probably have been at the very birth of language.

Our time is so limited and every day, especially when we have a family to care. I listened all the courses while I was ironing. I was very happy for that, I can continue learning and this is very important for me.Beside that, concerning the Grimm tales, I believe that listening is very important. These stories were told orally, as Sharla also mentioned above. This means that they have techniques for mnemonic and retain the interest of their audience: ""one, two, three... go!"", the are  rhythmic, they include easy to remember verses, they have simple descriptions, etc.In our days the story tellers are lost. We are reading more than we are listening (as we speak more than we are sing...). We are trained to read, our mind can retain more details, make combinations,   the words are images to  mark with a  highlighter...   For this reason we, the authors, can not continue  writing as before 2oo years. In my opinion (and this is a thought that is just growing up) we must find the simplicity of the old tales for the reader of our days. For this reason, it is important, not only to listen, but also to read the same tale, to see if there any difference in our understanding.This discussion I like. As a child I have memories from listening tales (or songs). We had no television, we were listening only radio and the time of the story was important, we were waiting the whole week for a friend of our grandmother to tell us the story. Now, I am so tired from all the images, photos, screens (computers), cameras, around me, and I looking the pleasure of that period, of simple words, and of listening (or singing).For the dilemmas (another nice greek word), there is only solution: do both! Only heroes have to chose one way, like Hercules. In our modern world, we can have more.Have a nice day all.;I visited the samples of previous students. Very useful, thank you for the information. Most of them discuss the plot. I think remarks concerning techniques of creative writing can be included, such as ""plot points"", ""the relation of the beginning with the end"", ""repetitive patterns"", ""environment"", ""time"", ""space"", ""the evolution of the  hero through the story"" (he/she changes?), etc. Sharing, I agree is very important. Have a nice day.;The number three I think is something more basic related with the way we understand the world, we can't explain it. I feel it is related the way I started walking. One: right step, Two: left step, Three: right again. We can't stop at number two, we have a movement and this needs the number three to stabilize ourselves.  From the other side, first time when something happens is nothing. Second time it is something to notice. Third time, we must react, else this will continue for ever.I made many thoughts, also, about number seven. See the Miller' s Law   ""...  the number of objects an average person can hold in working memory is about seven..."".  ;Dear Anastasiya, one  psychologue told us that when the children listen about bad heroes they feel better for their ""bad thoughts"", they think they are not so bad if for example they pushed their little sister, because there are much worse actions in the tales.   Is this also the reason that we love these stories? An interesting question.;Very interesting your post. Written stories are for readers and oral stories are for listeners. There have common, but also differences. As you mentioned in oral tales memorizing techniques must be issued. The same techniques are for an oral presentation in public: emphasize the basic points, repeat the essentials many times, use a simple language, strong descriptions: Black, White, Red (no Pinks...).;Very interesting your questions.  Below some thoughts.Why does everyone die?It just happens. The tales don't give an answer, a reason for that. Also, there is not life after death, no one returns back. The real life...  Why the cock doesnt feel angry: You are right, in the tales only those who have the power are getting angry (king, queen), the others no, they have to survey.What are all those animals at the end: The others... We...  ?Did you guys notice that all of these animals from the list were listed like a chain of food?  No, but if so, this shows that there is an ""architecture"". Generally, after the repetitive starting: one... two... three... the stories seem that they don't follow a design, the beginning doesn't prepare us for the end. For example, in the ""white snake"" at the beginning there are many words linked to sound/birds: noised air, voices, listened ... Then, there are birds, but where is the snake?    We find it again as memory in the tree of life (Paradise), but this is not so clear. I would like to see it, also in the middle of the story, stronger relations. May be this is normal, because they are stories ""written"" by many story tellers, and Grimm collected this oral tradition. We must not expect a very well organised plot of the stories.  ;"

I like the old editions of books recommended for the seminar, I feel comfortable with their margins, the pictures, the economy in the use of colour, the type, everything is so well placed in its place. The illustrations of these old books are also carefully designed and sometimes analysing these we can understant more, especially about the symbols included into the story. This happens because the illustrator had a relation with the author? The illustrations of the ""Little Prince"" were made by the author:  Saint-Exup  ry.  ;Very interesting your question, because refers to ""what is fantastic?"". Generally, we could say that all stories are products of our fantasy, only history is not (or should not...). I think that the fantastic is when happens something unreal, and this unreal changes the story. For example, in Disney's Mickey Mouse, of course the heroes are fantastic, there is not any duck speaking, but this doesn't change the story, like the magic horse's head as in the Grimms' ""Goose Girl"", who helps at the recognition of the princess by speaking. I am wondering if ""Asterix and Obelix"" comics are fantastic, because there is of course the magic   portion that helps them, but the stories are true (or almost).

I put these in a line:Dracula - physical power---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Medusa - mindThis line can also be seen as:Dracula - father----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Medusa-mother(Dragon' etymology is: ""Watching well"" and Meduca's is: ""dominate"" and ""care"" in ancient Greek).I thought that all the characters take positions into this line, and trying to find themselves they move; who reached the limits they died (lost) .  The child-mind (so nice!) searches his/her sexuality.  I felt fear when it was said it was Lucy who took the children, not with Dracula so much. I think that in our culture, mother can't hurt her children. Mina at the end asks ""Why are you  afraid  of me?""In Greek Mythology we known Medea who killed her children too. It is interesting that Medea's etymology is the same with Medusa's. Freud had an essay concerning Medusa's Head.  After the essay I think all these and I find more. I liked this story a lot.  ;Why not? Very possibly. Greek gods came from other civilizations;  with Egypt they were so close. It is very interesting that there is a female ""good""  goddess everywhere. That means our deep necessity to have a ""mother"" who loves and protects us. A ""bad"" mother, we can't accept, unless she is a step-mother. I had the chance to have a very good mother. Like Lucy, I had difficulties to be separated from her. Now, 10 years after I lost her, I can understand more this strong relationship. As a mother too (I have 2 daughters and 1 son), I hope that I'll leave them free to make their own lives. My father was  absent, but he was a good father. I didn't feel fear from Dracula, but from the female  vampires; for Dracula I felt sympathy like Mina. Also, I appreciate a lot the power of the mind. I  believe  that  knowledge  can help people. So,  I am Mina more than Lucy? So many questions, so many (no) answers. This makes this book valuable for me.;Hi Anna.From the comments of my reviewers I understand that I must ""write less"" not trying to say all my thoughts, ""cut"" and ""not paste"", because in 320 words there is not place for ""every"" (may be valuable) thought to be explained and understood. When I find something I feel happy and I want to tell to others too (a child-mind...), but the others are a little confused.  Of course there problems because I am not a native English speaker. In my language I can much better (I  believe...).Also, you ask ""how do you decide what to write and how?"".   I had courses in creative  writing and I am a writer too. So, when I read, I try to analyze my feelings, I am looking to find an architecture into the text. I like the essays that open me a window to see through it more into the text: another aspect. I am looking for techniques that makes the story interesting, and when I have an idea I am trying to find more evidences into the text, like to a detective. May be I don't have high scores in my essays, but the important for me is that I am learning from all this process to communicate better with others.Have a nice day.;I   am closer to Alan's opinion. The essay must help the ""attentive and intelligent student"" to understand deeply the text. This doesn't mean necessary that I, the teacher, must tell him my opinion. It is more to show him a way to think, a methodology.  ;"

Have a nice day!;Beauty and  Ugliness  Why  Frankenstein  created a ugly creature? It was really ugly or Frankenstein found it ugly?Frankenstein created a human, but when his creature came to life, he realized its ugliness and ran away from it, totally terrified, unable to love it.   He tried a lot: he studied philosophy and sciences; he worked like an    artist   : he collected beautiful parts of other human beings and he joined these proportionally, and also, he worked intensively, with enthusiasm, deeply concentrated on  his task.  But, Christian God was very happy and satisfied after the creation of Adam  [1]. Why is Frankenstein so unhappy about his Creature?In chapter V, the  Creature says the reason of his failure: ""Adam had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator. [  _] my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance   .  We understand that Creature is ugly because of Frankenstein's ugliness projection to it. But what is beauty?  Frankenstein was not physically ugly.  Is there a beauty that we can reach by keeping well defined aesthetic lows (as seen with our eyes), or   is it about an internal ""Beauty"", that comes out from our eyes,  formed  as a result of love, friendship, and especially from our offer to other people? (Plato [2], Plotinus [3].)It seems that Mary Shelley looks for such a definition of Beauty [4]. In many cases, she draws our attention into the eyes expression, where we can find the person's character. Frankenstein looks into Creature's ""watery eyes"", but sees nothing, because he sees himself, like Narcissus [5], who is empty.  His deep desire to achieve a big discovery turned him egoistically to himself: no friends, no family, no love. He reached his goal to make a big achievement, but this was not  in profit of the humanity. Unlike ""old Prometheus"" [6] who scarified himself to make human's life better, Frankenstein   s lack of love created a monster.  References[1]  ""Let us make humankind  in our image, according to our likeness [  _] God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good   , The Bible, Genesis.[2]  Plato (428-347 BCE), Greek philosopher.[3]  Plotinus(204-270 CE), major philosopher  of the ancient world.[4] Mary Shelley's handsband, Percy Bysshe Shelley,  made the translation of:  Plato,  The Banquet(1818).  Shelley was an accomplished Hellenist, and had a natural sympathy for Plato's way of seeing the world.[5] Narcissus (Greek Mythology)  was looking at his reflection in the lake.[6] Prometheus (Greek Mythology)  gifted humanity with fire.;Hi all. This is my essay. It had got a 5. I am happy for this. For me it is important the idea that we can't see beauty if we don't have an internal beauty. Of course there is the parameter of ""love"", love makes us feeling the beauty, and if this happens we are happy. I love this course, because makes me thinking all these beautiful things. Have a nice day! (from Greece).;Dear Florencia it seems that you are right. I have to read the book again, where others, Felix, Agatha and Safle see the Creature, what happens exactly. We must take into consideration that the Creature talks; what he says is viewed from his point of view: he  believes  to his ugliness, so he thinks  that this is the cause of other's rejection. If you are interested in this subject, read the following article:  Facing the Ugly: The Case of ""Frankenstein"". I didn't cited it because it refers to another philosopher' ideas.With art, a lot of times I say: ""I feel the beauty in my stomach"", not ""see"". A perfect painting or a photo may tell us nothing. An artist must have something to say with his art; as artists, we create what we are; we can reach beauty, not only with our technique (which helps to the communication), but also with our personality and ideas. So, beauty is more than knowledge. Knowledge can be achieved with learning, but beauty needs also our soul. some questions:Is beauty personal?  Is there a ""classic"" beauty as it is expressed  for example  in an ancient Greek statue?  Why Aphrodite of Venus is beautiful? (She couldn't be in our days a top model, I think...)Aphrodite  of Venus, Louvre Museum;Dear Jeremy, I was your peer 1. For me it was a ""6"". I found your essay: simple, clear and interesting. I like a lot etymology, the search of the deep meaning of the words. In the case of Frankenstein you showed us how the author attributed to each character his/her name, according to his/her role in the story. Very well done!;Concerning my name: Theodossia-> Theo+dossia, means God+given in Greek. This name makes me feel bad, when I want to be ""bad'. Our names sometimes say our story...;I love the course too. Very interesting, but also difficult, I have to try a lot, I hope to follow it till the end. If you know other such seminars in  literature, I would appreciate if you could tell me.;This was also my favorable story. First, it was diffiicult to understand, but finaly so beautiful. Good luck to all of us who are looking for the Beautiful, and we feel a little artists (not Artists).;As a not native English speaker, I have many difficulties too; I have to look at the dictionary all the time... But, we can't stop...;At my first essays I used to give citations from  Wikipedia;   I thought that the reviewer can find easier the information that I mentioned into my text. One reviewer told me that it is better to have more original citations, so now  I prefer to find the original article. But, In my opinion, If I really used Wikipedia, I think it is more ""fair"" to tell it; the time is so limited, we don't have the possibility to find the original sources. Also, for the essay of this week, I found many published in journals but I didn't have access to read the articles.;I have essays to review that are the abstracts of the stories. I don't think that an ""intelligent"" and ""attentive"" student needs that. Although, I understand the difficulties; for me the readings of this week were very difficult.;"

It's good to read the whole lot I think and then concentrate on a particular theme or aspect.http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.htmlAbout the essays it says'Your essays should aim to enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course. Each essay should be between 270 and 320 words. Attentive readers notice more than casual readers do, although casual readers may be responding unconsciously to many of the matters that attentive readers notice consciously. This difference in reading awareness arises in part from the fact that attention is limited. If I am attentive to the use of triples in fairy tales (three brothers on a quest, three questions testing the hero, and so on), then I might find that I   m not consciously attentive to other aspects of the narrative (the comparative intrinsic worth or worthlessness of the object of the quest, the rhetorical construction of a testing question, and so on). Because attention is limited, to understand works more deeply we need to slow down and take note of aspects of the reading that we find significant. Then, using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be. For example, if one notices that fairy godmothers occur only for child protagonists whose biological mother is dead, one might hypothesize that, at least psychologically, the fairy godmother takes the role of a mother and the fairy godmother   s entrance in a story is a promise of the love and protection that the protagonist has had taken away. The fairy godmother, then, is not so much a figure of magic as her magic is a metaphor for the continuing power of motherhood.Writing these essays and reading and commenting on the essays of your fellow students should make you much better prepared to learn from, and even question, the unit clips.

Either my mind has too many ideas about what might be going on in a story, or I have a problem with carrying a thought out to its logical conclusion. Likely the latter.  Hopefully this course will force me to hone that skill!;The priority here, it seems to me, is to read slowly and focus on developing close reading skills. Once we feel confident about that, any other resources or links would enrich our understanding of the   broader context around the work.;I'm not going to use any supplemental texts unless/until we get a firm answer on this, but in the past, I dealt with the issue by writing my essay first, and then scanning supplemental materials to see if I'd *missed* something (or worse, completely misinterpreted something!). Having said that, one of my English teachers in high school ""caught"" me checking out Cliffs Notes for The House of Seven Gables at the local public library and was aghast that one of her best students would resort to such a thing! Fortunately, I was in another teacher's class at that time, and trying to get to grips with *summer* reading... and I was nearly in tears trying to figure out what on earth he was on about. So she very kindly took an hour out of her day to explain the finer points of Hawthorne to me. I still hate Hawthorne with a passion, but I also still adore that teacher. I was lucky enough to have her again for AP English the following year, and she ended every class by making sure she had done her job well enough, and got us thinking about the material on our own enough, that none of us had to do something so horribly *gauche*   and *unimaginative* as resort to Cliffs Notes/Spark Notes. :);That is so awesome!

Anyone?;Ooohh, Diana Wynne Jones - so much fun to read. Tolkien and Hobb are other old friends - and of course, King. I am so going to have to go over this list once I get home and can hit up the library. Muhahahaha. *ahem*;I love Tolkien and Hobb!! Can't wait to start more of Hobb's books soon!;I love reading, especially fantasy books. There are books I have read many times, but when I fall in love with a book, I fall quickly and hard. When it comes to fantasy and science fiction, I adore The Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and lately I fell in love with Anne Bishop's The Black Jewels Trilogy.  ;I read an overabundant amount of poetry. In fact, I never feel like I read too many books which I'd like to change. My favorite are Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Maya Angelou, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Gray, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, Gwendolyn Bennett. I'm really hoping to expand and start reading more books. ;Fav authors: Isaac Asimov and Terry Pratchet. Favorite genres: horror, sci-fi/fantasy, ghost stories, and the classics. Many of the books that we are suppose to read, I've already read at one point. I remember reading Dracula in jr high. And that was a while ago. It was an abridged version of it. I've read Lewis Carroll's works, Grimms Fairy Tales, and reread Frankenstein in the past 3 years.

I am very excited to get started. As I already read quite slowly, I was wondering if you could let us know what specific tales by the Brother's Grimm we will be discussing. I was not able to get the version suggested in the notes but I own a volume of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales. I am not sure which tales overlap. I have been reading them in the evenings with my children but I would like to be sure to pay special attention to those that we will be discussing.;Thank you! That is a beautiful edition of these tales.;Thanks a lot! Librivox is almost always very good, though occasionally the old adage of ""You get what you pay for"" rings painfully true. ;I had the same problem and couldn't finish the course last time. My daughter unenrolled me by mistake and I was unable to enroll again.I plan to re-submit my essays, except for a couple I wasn't very happy with. Fortunately, I guess, I didn't see the lectures for most of the course so can't be influenced by them.I don't think you can have self-plagiarism, can you?;I am seriuoslt bummed that I need to bail out of this course. I believe that it is the perfect amalgamation between two of my great loves; writing and the inner working of the human mind but unfortunately I have dished too much into my plate at this time and as this is the most recent addition it is also the one that must take it's place on the back burner. Anything worth doing is worth doing right so I can't risk neglecting this course as a result of my other obligations or vice versa. I wish you all luck in the course and have added it to my watchlist so that i can be sure to hop on next time it comes around. But may I attempt at opening up a discussion before I leave? For interests sake. Why did you enroll in this course and what do you hope to learn from it? I was personally hoping to see if I could determine how external influences ( economic, geographic etc) could influence a writer. As well as the relationship between both science fiction and science fact and our need for fantasies as a society. I'm certain that you may believe that I am over reaching in my expectations of this course but I am certain that at least some of this may come to light, if not from the material then from the community involvement through Peer Responses and Forum posts.;try getting the files (books) in epub, mobi or azw, most of them are avaible in the links this site recomends, then you just open them on your kindle for pc with no problem, also you may try the calibre software to convert some of the files to formats the kindle and other e reading software use.mozilla Firefox has an e-reader that may come in handy in the future if the problem persists.

I especially liked how the little lies she told just fell perfectly into place, as if she had been planning such a prank for years.;The Grimm tales haven't been part of my upbringing. I have read them as a part of the college curricula. I have been reading them again and I have enjoyed reading of 'Six Soldiers of Fortune'. It is very rhythmic story, I felt.  ;I had to go back and reread that section.   Notice how very delicately they mention that they were married for a while, and the prince came to her at a time of day when the witch wouldn't be there... ;);My version is a little different? He asked her to marry him but she said ""I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out. When thou comest, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the tower, and thou shalt take me away on thy horse."" Naughty naughty!;But consider the question she asks the witch that gives her away:""Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the King's son is with me in a moment?""Clearly, though she can't climb down, he is not having any trouble climbing up!;I agree with both of you, however, I would like to point out a few things. Sci-fi was in it's own right a fantasy, an imagining of the possibilities of technology. But as we progressed closer to the reality of these fantasies, I feel that authors, screenwriters and even artists became too concerned with making their imagined 'technologies' more credible so that it could stand up to the scrutiny of their fanbase. So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science. Which is why I feel that the resurgence of steampunk has become so prevalent. Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.;It interests me that SFF like Mieville's seems to go back to the early fantastic/weird tales of Jules Verne and co., and that Steampunk's really flowering.  ;Yes, glad to know. I hop e to be able to do this course. It's th e end of tehe schoolyear and I have to read final papers and tests from my students.Fortunatilly I've read mostra of th e books.Ser you in class;Yeah, I also saw it. My guess is they are left from the previous course.  ;Lol ... pleased others saw this.   I almost unenrolled thinking that I made the error!   Oh well, no doubt they'll get fixed up as soon as Prof sees this thread!;It seems to me the Professor is referring to the human ability of thinking up something they would like (or fear) to meet in the real life instead of fantasy as a genre of fiction. As an ability of mind, fantasy is necessary to produce any work of fiction, fantasy and science fiction just being the genres where this is the most evident. This is the way I understood the statement.;Thank you very much for explaining this to me.I understand how large the class is and of course the professor and staff are not going to grade everyone's essays (sorry, Emily, doesn't happen that way).In the Greek and Roman Mythology course, we also have to do at least five peer reviews (many of us decided to do more). These assessments were only counted as that we did them. The grades given by peers are not in any way reflected in the final grade. An assignment is considered completed when an essay is written, submitted, and the writer responds to at least five peer essays.To me, that is a much better solution. It is not a matter of getting lucky with peer reviewers, it is an ethical wrongdoing that goes against everything I have learned through my education courses and as a teacher myself.  ;Katrina, I feel like you may be feeling like you have your back up against a wall, especially as a result of some unhelpful anonymous comments. I'm not upset at all by your comments. I was struck by your strong objections to it as a grading schema. My comments are not meant as an attack in any form, more of a ""she's  making interesting points, I want to know more.""   My comments were intended as offering another way of thinking about the grading scheme. I'm a social scientist at heart so I'm thoroughly interested in effects of and reactions to educational processes. Peer review and its relationship to fostering skills and community are topics of great interest to me professionally. Can you talk more about what your ethical objections to peer review are? Is there a system you think would work more effectively (please see my comments about fear of robots with a grading schema like the Mythology course)? ;I was wondering about the whole peer review process at first, first of all afraid there would be too few people signed up for the course, second of all that the others would be.....um.....not likely to be helpful? is that the best way to put it?.....but look at the introductions, we have a LOT of people that we should be HONORED to get their opinions on our work, and I think we will get a lot of value out of this course.   I was wondering, though--if there are any outstanding essays, will they be shared with the rest of us?   ;Yes, they do. Amazing to think of how many are taking this course, over 30,000 on my previous course! Really looking forward to learning with the Professor.;In my experience from previous Coursera-courses, peer assessment as part of the final grade works fine. :) I am under the impression that people do evaluate others in the same way they hope that others evaluate them - fairly and thoughtfully. So I wouldn't worry too much about this right now. If you do feel however that you're repeatedly getting very unfair feedback, then you should of course bring it up again later. For now I'd say that there is no reason to worry.;Thank you, Anonymous, for that example.  ;Thank you all for your input. I really did not mean to spark a heated debate, and for that, I am sorry. Frankly, I am surprised at how many people are okay with this system and at some of the comments I received just from asking a question. I always thought I was a progressive educator, but there are some things in which I will not budge. At this point, we must agree to disagree.  I am glad I made someone laugh at least, if nothing else. Happy  reading all!;Hey guys. I hope i'm doing the right thing in exposing my thesis here.I'm hoping for some input, because I don't want to be overly confident about this and then find out there were a bunch of loop holes.  Reading the book I started to notice a difference in the roles played by luck and virtues in the stories where the hero is a man depending on the male's social status.   In other words, whenever the hero is a common man, be it a tailor or a soldier, he's role as a hero is only established through trials and the use of some skill or virtue. On the other hand, princes or ""king's sons"", as it is usually put, barely need any virtues for luck is always on their side. Take the princes in Rapunzel and Briar Rose, for exemple. The first one happens upon   the tower where the beautiful girl is trapped and is lucky enough to catch the enchantress calling the girl and climbing the tower. Not only that, after falling from the tower and having his eyes pierced, has the luck of bumping into his beloved now in the desert and having his ailments permanently cured. The second one is just lucky enough to find the castle just as the hundred year curse had expired and the thorns posed no danger anymore.The only example I found that might contradict this theory is ""The Frog-prince"", in which the prince had to use his cunning to have the princess keep her promise and break his spell. Although this is true, one can argue that this character is not really a prince, as his title was stripped from him, along with his luck, when he was turned into a creature that was less than human.So far, this is what I have. Can I get some comments from you guys? Am I on the right track?;I guess Gulliver's Travels is proof that not all utopian fiction is science fiction. It is interesting that we look back on these fantasy fictions and label them sci-fi because they are utopian or dystopian. I ask Where is the middle ground? is fantasy always so polarised?;I definitely think that dystopian fiction is science fiction. These are some of my favorite stories to read, and I have read tons of them :-) It makes me sad that most of the newer ones seem to be for teens or young adults, but I read them anyway and enjoy the amazing new worlds being created. My favorite is the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, and if you haven't read them, I would suggest you do!;  What are the pleasures of fairy tales? Where are the neuronal paths that create the attraction to these old tales? How is it that in this super fast changing world, still these tales make me pour myself a cup of tea and draw into a corner and sink in pleasure. The tales that defy every single thing I've ever been taught about causal chain, plotting, character building, narrative viewpoint. Everything. And old as they are, how is it that I cannot put the book down?  And as writers, how do we create an effect like this?;I totally agree, Anon. They do picture for us, what fear can do, what being brave can bring, and one of my favorites, Hans in Luck, the uplifting optimism. They paint the face of humanity, bare. Desires, fears, all bare, no makeup, no justification.  I marvel at them, despite the horror they sometimes depict.  Yet, I am at a loss in how to create an effect like that.   Thanks;To the Berkeley fellow I say: Oh, baloney.   The Grimms' stories have incredibly obvious biblical themes woven all through them.

I had a mixed reaction to it. And, while we are on the subject, I know so many fantasy fans that love Labyrinth, but that movie bugs me to no end.

This came under their academic honesty/plagiarism heading so I guess that, in a sense is could be said to be dishonest.All such discussions should be tempered by the fact that this is a non-credit course being taken for self-improvement. Anything which enhances that process seems valid. One can't turn back the clock of experience so, in my view, there is nothing dishonest about Pavel submitting new work and, again in my opinion, it seems pointless to do otherwise. What can he gain by resubmitting the same pieces? Will he get some new insight from the feedback offered by his peers? Possibly, but he seems likely to gain more from a re-examination of the source material in the light of his experiences.;Adoration for the Medieval period is an important part of   German Romanticism (as well as the forest, the countryside, traveling) - but the settings of the fairytales are not strictly medieval.

Anon, you will find that many of the stories in the book will leave you with this feeling of abrupt ending or not-so-good writing style.

And now we know that flying space cars most likely can't (but not impossible!) travel from planet to planet, or that buttons can't easily (yet) materialize a cooked meal in an instant.   Most of Hollywood focuses on the action part of sci-fi rather then the wonder (Look at War of the Worlds Remake or Falling Skies).   But then there are series like Doctor Who that have gone on forever and they can still scientifically justify why Daleks look like salt shakers, a space ship is a police phone box, and why there are sound effects in space.;Hi Anon, I think the 1.8 average applies to form and content separately, not the combined total, so you'd need to average 1.8 + 1.8 = 3.6 for each assignment to pass :);Very insightful comment!

I know that some of you are not taking this class seriously because you don't need it for anything, but there are some people who are taking this course for their job or for credit in some way or what have you. I feel a little uncomfortable about grading someone's work when it actually might COUNT. As for scores, I am confused about them too, especially after watching the videos about not giving all 3s but then getting an A?   I'm also a little annoyed that there are some people who don't think that helping others improve in any capacity without getting something out of it themselves is worth it.

I can't say I feel very differently about the movie today except that I now understand the underlying concepts more.  ;I've been avidly following the discussion, and it appears, that Grimm tales in particular speak mostly to those who read/heard them before, and have additional levels of perception triggered by the experience.

So if you've stuck to the 320 words limit before you paste it in then you'll still be fine.Edit: Coursera also counts hyphenated words, for example ""fair-haired"" as two separate words, I think.;Megan, as far as I can tell, anything that is separated by a space or punctuation mark of any kind counts as a separate word!

All of these people tell fairy tales, and that is just the beginning. Link, especially, tells wonderful fairy tales. Kij Johnson (who is published under Link's publishing house occasionally) is also good for this--her story ""Ponies"" is terribly dark and wonderful and very much a fairy tale. It's available for free online here, as well as part of Johnson's ""At the Mouth of the River of Bees"" which is also very good.Honestly, I think it's a matter of knowing where to look, especially if you want more traditional-styled tales. Having worked in ""literary publishing"" and gone to conventions and sat there and listened/added to the conversations, I know they're there--mostly in short story collections, books published by smaller presses (Small Beer!), and literary journals (The Fairy Tale Review pops into mind, although there are others). You just need to search a bit.;Literary journals are generally found at conventions, or purchased online through subscriptions or individual issues now-a-days. Honestly, most people I know who keep up with literary journals are people who either publish in them or people who work for one. It's very insular.Your best bet for most is independent bookstores and online, because chain bookstores generally only carry works published by the Big Six publishers, and most of these authors publish through smaller or indie presses. All of the authors I listed have actual, physical books released, although most are also available as ebooks too. Kelly Link actually releases most of her stories for free online, and I know Kij Johnson has a few free ones floating around online, too.Although all of the authors I mentioned are award-winning authors you probably aren't familiar because major publishing houses do not often publish short story collection outside of collections from people who are already majorly famous (story collections don't sell as well as novels)--and most of these authors are short story writers.That said, Jane Yolen is actually insanely famous, but mostly in the 90s.

My original training is in philology and Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm were prominent figures in philology. As such, we discussed them and their work in great detail. As mentioned in this link:http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/IE_Main5_Grimm.htmlthey collected tales from all over Europe. Some of the village storytellers they interviewed to collect their tales were interviewed about it after the tales' publication. The Grimm brothers did not simply write their tales according to everything I ever encountered in the field.Moreover, one of my German instructors was a specialist in the Grimmmaerchen. He also confirmed this impression. My copy of the tales is the Goldmann edition (isbn 3442004128), containing the original German. Its introduction also refers to the tales as collected rather than written as original work by the two Grimm brothers.Certainly the tales were edited and the multiple versions of most tales collected compared, but I have never before heard the tales epresented as simply written by the Grimms.Am I misunderstanding something?;To address a few comments above;The stories,as I have always understand, were collected specifically to test certain philological theories and originally published with only other philologists in mind. So writing their own tales would have been counter-productive. I have always understood the brothers were happily surprised when the public also took an interest.I'm not sure I get the point of the Disney comments.;Dystopic fantasies anyone?

Next to video link on the right side.;In the story ""The Cat and Mouse Partnership"" the cat and mouse represent the multiple nature of humanity.   The cat represents the predatory selfishness, deception, and opportunism that humans exhibit.   His nature is illustrated by his statement that ""Nothing tastes so good as what one keeps for one's self""while eating the fat he and the mouse had saved for winter, when no food would be available. Also by his eating the mouse at the end of the story, he further demonstrates that he possesses these traits. The mouse on the other hand represents the trusting and altruistic side of humanity.   She holds up her end of her agreement with the cat, keeping house for him and trusting all the while that the fat they are saving for winter will be shared in lean times.   The cat's eating the mouse at the end of the story, followed by the statement ""and that is the way of the world"" indicates that these aspects of human nature are incompatible because those who are too trusting are bound to get taken advantage of.

I agree with what you said that the first time is a random happenstance, the second time establishes the pattern, and the third time breaks it. While I do enjoy studying symbolisms in stories, I think that in this case maybe the use of threes is just for effect. After all, these stories were written for the purpose of teaching values and children learn better when there are patterns and repetition.;Three Blind Mice we sang as children.

These are attributes that emerge from internal as opposed to external stimuli. Hans is at peace with himself, and the world, and is therefore happy. Is this moralstic? Instructional? That's hard to say. ;Reminds me of the character Tom Hanks played in Forest Gump,  ;Hans is indeed lucky, he has inner peace and that is a wonderful thing to have. The gold means no more than the lump of rock, he does not need possessions to make him happy, how many of us would value that peace of mind in this material world.;Before I begin my post, a tad bit of info about me. I'm a college prof, computer science, but also a professional storyteller; think the oral story tradition. I registered for this course to engage in discussions of the types of writting I enjoy: tales and science fiction. I read and write and publsh SciFi. Now for the meat of my post. The Brothers Grimm did a wonderful thing by scouring the countryside for oral tales, which they then set down in written form. Or did they? How much of what they wrote is actually what they collected, transcribed, and how much is ""made up""? Let's leave that an open question, for now. Instead, allow me to discuss what happens when oral tales are transcribed. The Brothers Grimm are not the first to ever transcribe these ""folk"" tales. On the contrary, many, many individuals and groups have done so over time. The Foxfire series is a wonderful modern example of this sort of effort. But the way we speak is not the same as the way we write, yes, both are based on the same grammar rules, but that's perhaps where the similarities end. Both the act of telling a story and of writing a story demand that one knows the ""story"" first. Knowing a story, however, does not imply memorizing a story. Consider how when describing that fish you caught, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Or, better yet, consider givng directions to someone how to get from point A to point B. Depending on who we retell this story to (and, yes, giving directions is telling a story), we may add or subtract details, as well as adjust the language used to match the listener's age, etc.  Yet, the story we retell is exactly the same each time. Why? Becase we know the story, and it from what we know that we recreate the oral delivery of the story. What one tells, or writes, is an instance of the story inside her head. How do we know stories? Again, that's another, related topic, for another discussion. Moving on to written stories, each is also a story instance. But unlike oral stories, written stories generally consist of complete sentences (not fragments), and contain sufficient detail for most readers. And oral story instance, therefore, is one state of an evolving story rendition, whereas written story instances are fixed for all time. Yes, there are multiple translations of Grimm tales, but they're all based on the same source material, differing in the intent ofbthe translator(s). Nuff said! ;Given the shear number of attendees, for thus course, I will assume there must be other unuversity-level faculty participating just for the joy of learning. So, where are you? ;Here  _;Here who? ;I'm Lisa Stapp.   This fall, I will be Adjunct Instructor for an online class, ""Professional Ethics"" at Concordia University, Seward, Nebraska.I'm here for the sheer joy of learning.

I just hope those peers who are reviewing essays each week are aware that not everyone in the course is well-versed in the art of literary argument writing.   Also, there are many non-native English speakers, who struggle with the nuances of English writing.Kindness and constructive criticism will go a long ways towards building a vibrant learning community.Several of the peer feedback comments I received on the Grimm Brothers assignment were incredibly helpful and encouraging, Thank you to those kind souls, as I now have a much clearer direction for future writing.   It will indeed be a steep ""learning curve"" in this course regarding a literary writing style.I must admit, however, that I  also found some of the peer feedback I received to be unkind and more about advancing that person's ego and self-appointed status as an ""expert critic"".   This was really an inappropriate use of the peer feedback component of the course.This community of learners is diverse, so let's celebrate that diversity, not discourage other learners.Constructive criticism would be deeply appreciated by those of us struggling with writing in a literary style and/or those who are writing in a non-native language.We are all interested in life-long learning and everyone of us brings unique perspectives to the course that can enrich the learning of an intelligent and attentive audience.;The moral is like that of throwing a stone into the pond, it causes ripples. One person's action can have a reaction that affects many. Every living creature is going to die but if the hen had not been greedy and untruthful, she would not have died then and caused such a chain reaction. Be honest and truthful.  ;I agree with Racheal Smithson . And for raining it is used in either happiness or sadness it depends on the situation and the way its being said. So here the sister was weeping wich mean crying and as their situation is so harsh that made even the sky cry as well . The metaphor is so effective and describes alot of feeling .;This is indicative of how much influence a translator has over the meaning of a story.   Are the Grimms fairy tales we were assigned (the one on gutenburg) changed from the orignal German to better reflect the norms and values of the english?;Kim, I agree with you that it's hard drawing that line with younger children. I'm really learning that now that I have a 2.5yo. I want to say that this should be an ongoing dialogue over the years, that gets both more general and more specific as she gets older and has more life experience and opinions of her own to bring to bear.As an example, I'm nearly finished reading her Dodie Smith's The 101 Dalmations (ie the original from 1959, not the Disney versions, neither of which she has seen. She's only just learning to hear and understand a longer story, and is mostly enjoying this as something we do together, that's about dogs! So for her now I simply skipped the section with the Gypsies, as well as the patronising of Missus for her ""female"" lack of spatial awareness. The next time we read it together, and certainly when DD can read it for herself, she will presumably be more ready for some of the discussions around those representations. At the moment those are minor skippable parts of the narrative, so I'm skipping them.;Megan, Karen, Andrea et alI haven't had the chance to do more than skim the thread over the past few days, but thank you for being thought provoking and teaching me.;Marla, I keep coming back to your post and wanting to comment on how much I think we let 'BACK THEN' off the hook too much. I'm torn though, because it's the privilege of my education (familial, formal, and self-read) that means I was pretty aware of some of these topics 20 years ago as a teenager (sexism especially, anti-Semitism definitely, other racism + homophobia theoretically, transgender issues probably not at all) and knew vast swathes of history about some of it. (In 1994 I did a school project about Christine de Pisan, a 14th century French writer who argued strongly against the denigration of women, and addressed her writings (at least in theory) to women of all classes, not just queens and nobles.)In short, I don't think we can always excuse classic writers for their bigotry, even when we still read and discuss their work for its historic value and literary merit.;I read a good many of the original versions of Grimm's and Anderson's stories when I was eight or nine, but I was also exposed to the watered-down Disney-ed versions. The differences were so striking that I could help but think of them as different stories altogether, not just different versions of the same story. There was Ariel in the Little Mermaid, and there was the mute mermaid who had to walk on sharp knives and bleed in silence all day in the original version. The violence in many of the stories greatly disturbed me, particularly the thought of Snow White's stepmother being forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes till she died. That's why I think I have never thought of fairy tales as being simply ""for kids"". The watered-down versions certainly, but not the originals. With my recent re-reading of Grimm, I think it is more illuminating to think of fairy tales as being a window into the societies and cultures that they passed through. The true value of fairy tales is historical - these were the qualities valued in men and women, these were the prevailing attitudes, these were the common professions, this was the social structure.;OK, so I was exaggerating, but just a little.   :)   And what I am finding in evaluating essays is what I felt my problem was.   Ideas were not developed enough.   Yes, a theme can be stated in a sentence, but often I think the theme needs to be explained.   It is hard for me to adequately explain my thoughts in so small a space.   Most of the essays I have read seem incomplete because the good ideas or thesis (which many lacked) are not developed.   My original essay ran about 750   words on Word, and that was as economic as I thought I could be. I was shocked to see I was way over the word limit.   So I cut and changed, and re-wrote, re-thought and got the word count down, but I fear that the connections/points I wanted to make won't be obvious, that the essay will feel jumbled.   I hope we'll get to see a good essay that is within the word count limit.   So far, I have not seen any near one and I fear my own will fall into that category too.    I am a verbose writer, I know, so maybe this class will help me to learn to be more concise, although I write creative fiction mostly, not non-fiction.   ;I like your analogy, I think, but I am Math imparred, so it goes way over my head.   :0   ;Hi Luis, wath i really asked myself was : why was the rabbit in our world?;This is  a good idea for the new book. ;Gender issues in Dracula is something that has been examined for some time - in particular the nature of the roles both genders play - when I studied the text for pre university entry, I examined the idea that the female vampires became the ultimate threat for a man - women who penetrated rather than became penetrated - but then, in turn this came from their own penetration by Dracula - analogy for syphilis and the spread of disease, but also the transfer of power and the roles that vampire and hunters have compared to the traditional roles played in the 'family' home.;""He had impure thoughts, yes.

I had never read the book before or seen any of the films or television adaptations. So this was my first ever time of being introduced to Alice and the wonderful Wonderland. I fell in love with it. I think it's such an amazing book. I am not criticising the thread starter or anyone else by the way, because it is clearly a topic that a lot of people have discussed over the years. I was just never aware of it that's all. I just felt like I needed to say that. But also to say that I really do love this book. It was amazing to be introduced to Alice for the first time and see Wonderland through her eyes. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this course.;What a lovely and thought provoking post. I also love Alice in Wonderland and viewing life from Alice's perspective as she tries to make sense of it all. Total classic.;paedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is a mental illness/personality disorder.

I can't even find where I ask this question - feeling technologically challenged! ;Mine was evaluated 5.5, and am very happy about this grade and the sympathetic and useful comments of my peers. :-DBut one of them wrote I should have given more examples and explain them. Of course I was not able to do that due to the word limitation, since I followed it (ca 310 words). Btw, my second essay (about Alice) is already written, and has 320 words exactly.Good luck to you all.  ;So has mine!;It may be a a problem with particular browsers but the tech people should know.. It's much more difficult to write a short essay than a long one so they should be penalised in my opinion; as the person above has suggested.;Agree, the system should not accept anything over the word count. If I had such a long essay, I would just mark and read to the word count but luckily mine have all been okay so far.;I haven't received an overlong essay yet.   If I did, then it would get a 1 for form for ignoring the instructions (after checking the word count).   I wouldn't penalize it for content, though.;I have to agree with these posts, the grading is difficult. While most gave an attempt at a thesis, it was what I would consider an obvious thesis or something that we already knew. It did nothing to enrich or enlighten my thoughts on the collection as a whole or on an individual story. With that being said, this is a MOOC, while the syllabus says one thing for the type of student that should be in this course, that is not necessarily what is here. Who are we to say what is intelligent and what is not, I personally don't want to say that anyone is unintelligent, that is not my goal here. I say if there is at least an attempt at a thesis and a clear logical train of thought then hey, E for effort. If there is some work that can be done, I will be more than happy to give some polite constructive feedback. We are all here to get something different out of this class. I personally am interested to get others views on these classics and to finally get them read. Three quarters of the books on the syllabus are on my to be read list that I haven't gotten around to, and this is a good way to do it. Just my two cents on this whole grading thing that everyone is stressing over....;I find it hard to judge/evaluate essays that are clearly written by someone who for whom English is a second language.   I understand that everyone needs to use proper grammar, etc., but I found myself feeling guilty for giving low points when I realize that maybe it is not the ideas or concepts that seem flawed but the confusing way of expressing them.   ;Exactly, and this is after all a peer review. No one is going to get college credit for this course. I am interested in what others will say about my thoughts and I will take their feed back and welcome it. Give low points, don't give low points, it's really up to you as the one doing the grading. Just give your honest feedback. That is all you can really do. Some will get mad, some won't care. It all depends on why they are here.I will be honest, I am an avid reader, I read between 3 and 12 books per month, I have an above average IQ, I also have a GED because I dropped out of high school and have only completed 2 hours of college credit and those were online courses. Some would say I am not qualified to take this course per the syllabus, but I feel that I am qualified. So, here I am, like it or not.Don't get me wrong and think I am not taking this seriously, I am. I just don't expect much from other people, I am a pessimist. It will be what it will be. No point in getting your panties in a wad over it is all I am saying. ;);I think I may have been generous with my grades for this first time, but I don't think I will for the next go round.   Everyone should be learning how to write essays, and hopefully got some pointers.;Four of the essay simply didn't offer a thesis. One of them wrote why (s)he liked reading the tale (s)he chose. I didn't want to be harsh (but I guess I was :S), but I had to stress our assignment required us to propose what some patterns or aspects could suggest. I graded their contents a 1.;Professor Rabkin also sees Hans in love with his mother. Perhaps he's also projecting his personal prejudices onto the history of the Grimm brothers. Some people see what they want to see. And some people blindly follow them.;Why did Rabkin ignore all the women and children and powerless people who here killled horribly in the tales? It was an old woman who was shoved into an oven not a Jew.   Yet he is willing to dismiss this with a dated psychological fantasy.     The first victims of the Nazi killings were not Jews. They were disabled children and women and men.   Yet Rabkin seems not to express the same horror over these stories. Yes I do believe Rabkin showed prejudice.Because they do not follow Propp's rules means nothing. It does not show any malevolence or agenda of any kind. Fairy tales are adapted everywhere, the Grimms didn't do anything unusual. And even if in hindsight they seem poor folk lorists,   I didn't see any proof at all that they had any kind of agenda just a bunch of conjecture by Professor Rabkin .;You are ignoring the fact that the killing started with useless people much like the old women in Grimm not with the Jews. When people ignored that it spread on to the Jews.My point is that violence against ""useless"" old women being accepted is a more likely contribution to the Nazi mindset than any antisemiticism in Grimm. Violence against women and children and powerless people   is still happening today but people fixate on a period in history that everyone can agree is evil and so don't have to look at the world around them. Your inventing a ""backstory"" about blood libel doesn't change that.   The fear of being eaten is a primal fear that appears in a lot of cultures not just Europe.I'm disagreeing with   opinions   not denigrating the people who are making them.   ;http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/disabilities/I've been assuming you understand my reference to the killings beginning with disabled and useless. But just in case.;I never said a campaign to harass useless old women was the real horror of Germany. The article I referred you to was from the holacaust musem. Do you have some prejudice against information that doesn't come from Wiki?;I didn't say their website supports that statement. I don't know if the people at the museum would agree or not. And neither do you. You have as much value as any other human being and you have as much right to argue as any one else does. Every individual has equal value. That's what I've been saying.;I am a little dismayed at the fact that although I took thoughtful time and consideration to write not only my essay but the peer reviews as well, in return I received peer reviews which did not meet up with the minimum guidelines of at least 30 words!   In addition, I think if you are making a statement on grammar and word usage, the reviewer might take the time to also submit the review in the same manner.   Incomplete sentences or just a few words doesn't give much credit to the reviewer.   Though some of the reviews had valid points, I was just a little disappointed that it appears as though the reviews were made last minute and haphazardly.   As I am not receiving a grade for this work, the reviews are important to be able to improve my writing skills.   I feel I wasted my time submitting reviews instead of reading the next assignment.   Sorry for the rant but I feel it is important to point out.I also noticed I only had 4 peer reviews - shouldn't there be 5?   I recall making at least 5 reviews.    I actually submitted a few more as it will help me in the long run to view other points of discussion for the reading assignment.   ;That sounds like an excellent idea too, you might want to focus on one or two, however, just so you can explore it in depth.  ;I agree. It   s not about pretending that grammar isn   t an issue because it is (if you can   t understand what someone else is trying to say then how do you expect to comment on it?), but the idea is to give constructive criticism rather than simply dismissing an exercise because the person doesn   t have a lot of experience writing in English.   I   m not a native English speaker, and one of the reasons I enrolled in this class was to practice and find ways to improve myself and communicate better with others. I would hate to find people here who either completely disregard anything I have to say because it   s not phrased properly, or don   t point out my mistakes for fear of making me feel bad, because we   re all here to learn.   ;I didn't mean he was wrong. It just   he was too harsh in my opinion. I search into Hobsbawn and Burns and not at once they make the link whit german's superior race. After all, nationalism was very strong everywhere and the ""germans"" was still trying to figured out what being a german meant.  ;Alice is unsure of her identity, she cannot recite the poem correctly and it appears that being in Wonderland has affected her. The caterpillar questions who she is and she is unsure as things keep changing.;I shouldn't answer this because I am already working my essay around it, but I don't think Carroll is defying the laws of our physical universe, if you look at mathematical laws and if you look at chaos theory which in early theory was developed by mathematicians, you can say that Wonderland is really built on mathematical law.However, since my essay will be based on this due to the amount of mathematical patterns I have seen in the story, I don't want to say anymore. I already don't know how to get it down to 320 words. LOL;Suggestion to all examining this - look closely at chess and its structures - indeed, there have been writings about Carroll's usage of chess metaphor, the ideas that relate to development and the logic behind it. Hope this helps.;Very good point with good examples as well Emma - I personally feel there is no difference in Wonderland and 'this' reality - [in regards to physics anyhow] - granted we don't have the size changing and talking animals, but that is more about perception rather than actual physics... isn't it?;Thanks for the link. This is an old version..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlN8rrmOVU;Well you should be on to Alice and Through the Looking Glass by now, and yes, I'd say you should read all of both books.;The program will not accept submissions exceeding the 10% standard allowed over the word count.  ;I have evaluated many more than five essays and none has been over the word count.;Mary how many paragraphs were they? 300 words is going to be about three or four average paragraphs.Also did you get the word count from MS Word or something else? I used Word for my essay and it was very close to the Coursera word count.;I find it difficult to imagine how ONE person out of the thousands enrolled in this course, received three essays, each one from three different people, totaling exactly 1,000 words. This is truly odd, an absolute abomination - especially since the program will not allow submissions of that length!     ;Hello, I have given grades to all 5 assignements with great hesitation. I do understand that overall in such MOOC, we should end up with 10-30% of the grades regarding the form and content being 1's, and not more than 20% of the grades being 3's. I understand that this should work when grading at least 20 assignments. (Which I  know I am welcome to do). However, I have found that very challenging on my particularly small selection of 5 assignements...   I am ending up for example with a  paper without conclusion and another paper entirely retelling the story... So, my question is: does this rule apply for our particular selection?;I should think it does not apply for any particular selection of essays. We are to grade the essays based on weather they are good or not and not just compare the 5 essays we are given.Having said that, I did find it helpful to assess more then 5 essays, as it did give me a chance to run into more quality essays and made me more confident in grading them.;I think I understand what you are saying. The percentages do not work out in the five essays I received either. Three of mine I'd like to give ones on everything to, and the other two are only satisfactory. None of them wowed me or even were up to snuff in my opinion. So, yeah, I just graded the fairest way I knew how and didn't worry about the percentages.;We are to review 5 essays. 6 and over is optional, but 5 is obligatory. ;I was happy with my evaluation. It was really nice to read the positive comments and I also appreciate the comments explaining to me where I could improve. I agreed with the suggestions offered  to me. One of my peers wrote the absolute bare minimum (about 5 words for each) which was frustrating because I couldn't really take much from what they said, but it could be that they simply didn't have the time to evaluate more than that. Overall, I feel happy with my results :);Same here. Nice comments, I agree where I made mistakes, but I had one person being negative without motive and in just one sentence. ""Everyone knows fairy tales do this"" isn't good feedback. And if you think about it, most of us know the themes that appear in the stories, so what, now we can't talk about them?;I got something along the lines of: really? that's your argument? if that's why the stories are great then all stories are great. I understand if people don't agree or are not convinced with the points I'm making, but there's no need for sarcasm as I am only learning and don't have all the answers.;I thought some of it was too subjective. I got marked down by someone and their comment was ""that's not what I would have focused on.""   I also think that the assignment details stating most should be graded as a 2 influenced graders to grant people a score of 2. ;Two of my reviewers were complimentary enough to make my day and the other 2 were lukewarm and complained about things that weren't required like not including more than one story in the 320 word analysis.  You just never know. It's kind of hard to write for such a diverse unknown audience. ;I don't know if I read your essay, but I did mention to one writer that I wish they had given examples from other stories, because it seemed like the assignment was to go over themes that were present in the whole book that we read. I didn't mark the essay down for it, it was just something that I thought would have made their essay even better which is what the reviewer is supposed to comment on. ;I had high hopes for the peer reviews since everyone's been saying how great and wonderful they are and unfortunately, I have been greatly disappointed. Two of my reviewers wrote only in the form and content sections with a few words each and that's all. Another reviewer just explained how he/she disagreed with me, but never talked about how I could improve my own essay's form or content. I only had four reviewers as well. How is it justified that some people are having five graders and others have less? My overall grade was high, but "

It takes a lot   of work.   I do try to be thorough and give good, useful comments.   But since I have been mostly rather disappointed in the essays, I wanted to read more, see if I could find a really good essay.   I discovered I could not read more without evaluating them, so I gave each of the optional ones what I felt was my honest assessment by numbers, but I made no comments.   I read until I found one I felt comfortable giving a 6, which was quite gratifying.  ;So could you possibly get evaluations from more than 4 people?    So far I've only gotten 4 each time.   So I am thinking not, that you only get comments/grading from among the original reviewers assigned to you.   Will all evaluations be seen by the author?   If you evaluate the ones you are assigned, the optional ones you do will or won't be seen by the authors? If the author does not see them, them comments don't matter.;Thanks for this information.   In the future, I'll not review if I don't have time to comment.   ;OK, I understand.   But I just don't have the time to do as thorough a job of reviewing more than I am assigned.   So I guess that means I shouldn't read more.;I think it is helpful to read all the essays you are given to review FIRST, before grading any of them.   It helps you get in the mood, get ready to focus better, I think.   Also, wine helps tremendously.  ;I was joking about the wine.   Is there an online wine tasting course?   That could be fun.   ;I think it's almost as hard to come up with comments as it is to write the essays.   I want to be helpful, but I'm not a teacher!   If I think it sounds like they're making up BS as they go along, should I call them on it?  ;I agree Florencia, the same thing happened to me. Last time I was marked down for spelling errors, so I proofread my paper a dozen or so times, and yet I was still given a 2 for form. The only negative feedback I received was that there were a few ""editing mistakes"" - which were not clarified, and after having 3 co-workers read it, we still never found any. Then, another person said I needed fewer paragraphs. Granted, I did have   5 paragraphs, but each one was the shift in a new idea or point, which is when you are supposed to write a new paragraph. I am confused on how this made my grade a 2 when the other 2 graders said my paper ""flowed beautifully"" and was well written and structured.I had an open mind last time and accepted what the reviewers said, but this time I feel my paper was better written and had really good feedback. I am super frustrated!!  ;Thanks Paul,     That actually does make me feel a little better. I think I am just holding myself to too high of a standard as I have an English degree and taught English for a number or years. Granted it has been a while, since I was in school. I just think some reviewers are being extremely nit-picky and looking for reasons to mark people down.   ;I find some of the essays so poorly written or thought out that giving a 1 seems like high praise.   In the future, perhaps there should be a 0 grade possible as there were in other Coursera classes I have taken.   Just a suggestion.   ;It was just a suggestion.   I have given 1s (and detailed comments ) to people I thought were trying and also to those who obviously didn't take the assignment seriously.   I felt bad for those who I thought were trying, but didn't quite come up to par (2), but for those who wasted my time, I would have liked the option to not give them any points.   If people knew that they could get a 0, perhaps the one sentence, non-sense works or writings that didn't in any way have anything to do with the assignment would stop. In the other classes I've taken where an essay and evaluations were required, there was always a 0 grade option.   In one there was also a criteria for citations, in addition to form and content.   One had to grade whether the citations were proper.   Actually, If it were me, I would like more options, from 0 to 5, which would then correspond with grading most understand.   0 = poor, 1 = tried, but not quite, 2 = adequate, 3 = above average and 4 = excellent.   Nobody would have to give a 0, but I think the option might be useful, would allow the reviewer more choices and give the authors a more accurate assessment of what the reviewer thought of their work.   And again, this is just a suggestion.   I respect your view;   we don't have to agree.         ;Okay, so the way we should look at the reviews is.....all of us are probably equally nervous about reviewing wrong, just as we're afraid of our essays not being quite right.   Or we are are absolutely adamant about the reviews we gave, as well as the perfection of the essays we wrote.   Or something like that.   Yeah, I think I waste too much time reading the forums, it just makes me stressed out.  ;One fact is Carroll's family never wanted to discuss his - probable - tendency for, or to, little girls. We can't forget Carroll was very fond of photography... ;-)  ;Oh, one of the leading  portrait photographers... Really? Portrait:   a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person, especially one depicting only the face or head and shoulders.   - http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/portraitWas photography the Dodgson's job, or  one of his  jobs? No. Was it an hobby or a pastime? Yes. One of the best photographers or not, he was an amateur, not a pro, ie he didn't make  a living from it; he was very fond of photography, because he spent money on his hobby or pastime. His profession was to teach Maths.

Hi!;Whilst not individually calculable, multiply each section by 5 to gain the total mark - this will then tell you the potential combination of marks.an average of 1 or 3 will tell you that you got 1s or 3s from every person, regardless of number of reviewers.If you have had 5 reviewers, then  between these figures tells you that the figures vary:1.2- a total of   6: 1,1,1,1,2*1.4-  a total of   7: 1,1,1,2,2 or 1,1,1,1,3  1.6-  a total of   8: 1,1,2,2,2* or 1,1,1,2,31.8-  a total of   9: 1,1,1,3,3 or 1,1,2,2,32 - a total of 10: all 2s*, or  1,1,2,3,3 or 1,2,2,2,32.2 - a total of 11: 2,2,2,2,3* or 1,2,2,3,3 or 1,1,3,3,32.4 - total of 12: 3,3,3,2,1 or, 2,2,2,3,3*2.6 - total of 13: 3,3,3,3,1 or 2,2,3,3,3*2.8 - total of 14: 3,3,3,3,2*The grades that have been put in italics are less likely as they show more variation and range- however, as has been discussed, this is not improbable due to the amount of different reviewers. Starred ones are most likely as they have least range, but again, not necessarily the case. However, a consistent student should find their grades slowly improving.Apologies if this was obvious to people, I thought it may help as a quick mental note to assist in quickly working out potential grades - hope it helps someone.;I was one who wanted to see what a 6 essay looked like too and now I'm really stoked since I actually got a 6 this time.   Woo Hoo!   OK,   I know it really doesn't mean anything, but it was a lovely surprise.   Thanks all who gave me such praise.             I do believe,    said Alice at last,    that they live in the  same  house!      She was referring   to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but in both  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass, the idea of interconnectivity is prominent.   Throughout both books, dreams and reality contain similar objects.   The outside world can suddenly be inside, and the non-sensical can have its logic.   By expanding, shrinking, compartmentalizing and/or blending ideas, Carroll illustrates that all perspectives emanate from the same place, and that source is the human imagination where all things - games, animals, plants, minerals and/or people - meld and share a common language.  Language, an expression of human imagination, is the glue that often connects and transmits ideas and imaginings outwardly.   But there are  places in the mind where language is silenced or has    no names,    such as the forest on the way to where Tweedledum and Tweedledee  live, that stay inside.   Through the use of puns, repetitions, made up words, syntax reversals and all sorts of language play, Carroll shows the human imagination can be playful and whimsical, or scary and full of sorrow.   He shows both associative and dissociative tangents.     Dialogue is positioned as a kind of outside language, one heard and responded to by others, a way to interact and engage, but thoughts are given equal weight, forming a kind of inside or secret language (a talking to oneself), which is often in direct opposition to what is spoken aloud.   All of the ways language functions in the stories seem to illustrate the varying (and often oppositional) perspectives possible and they all come from the same source.               Carroll shows that any perspective is possible, that human imagination can create, bend, destroy, or blend.   His tales create impossible worlds, which can push the human mind to new ways of thinking about the world, what reality is or can be, and  all ideas    live in the  same  house."";Intense abstract post modernism????  ;Thanks for your honest critique.   You comments show that a score is dependent on what peers evaluate your work.   I thought my first essay was much better than this and only got a 4.   So that is why I said before that the score doesn't really mean anything.   Critiques are subjective and not all will agree about what is an appropriate marking..;To the other Anon - your note/critique/message above, ""Intense abstract post modernism????,"" is quite cryptic.   I have no idea what you are talking about.   What are you asking?   I don't even know what post modernism is, let alone how you are using the phrase in relation to my work.   If you want a response, please state more clearly your concern or question, and explain what   ""abstract post modernism"" is.      ;Loved this!   Thanks for sharing!   Excellent essay.   I had previously thought about the identity question, but couldn't get a clear enough idea for an essay.   You hit it exactly on the head, I think, especially in the last paragraph with your ideas about what Carroll was asking.;I loved the oxymoron you used, ""playfully serious.""     I enjoyed reading your essay and thesis (I think you are saying that Carroll understood that true education needs both logic and creativity - correct?), but I was confused because I do not understand many of your terms or connections.   For example, what did   ""Ken Robinson's Ted Talk on How School is Killing Creativity?""   argue and how does his argument or theme relate to what you are saying about Carroll's theme in the book?   Since I do not know this talk, I can't understand how it relates to your work. And what is ""The Victorian education system?""   A brief explanation on this concept would have helped me.   Likewise, I would have liked more understanding of what you mean by the term ""lessons""   you state Carroll referred to.   What were the lessons the book gave about politics, mathematics and history?   I For me, your essay would have been more powerful had you been clearer about the concepts and included more direct connections between them.  ;anonymous:  http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/schoolday.html  - this should help explain the Victorian Education system;I got a 5.5 on my first essay.

Yes, the book had an  imaginative premise and strong  central theme but both were almost entirely lost in Mary Shelley's over-wrought and over-written style. Yes, I know it was the Victorian period, but many of the initial reviews of her book even at that time were highly critical. Dracula, as written by Bram Stoker, does not suffer from the same faults and stands the test of time much more gracefully. This book was a chore to slog through. I'll take the Boris Karloff version any day!;This is just an opinion, but Mary Shelley, at eighteen years old, probably already understood more psychology and was a better writer than Stoker coming along seventy years later.     The grand bore of the men of Dracula prefigure the sort of self congratulatory fools that one can find at shooting range with an open bar.     If only the count had been a lttle less well mannered I would have rooted for him.     See....look at what that dreadful Stoker novel did to me.     I sound like one of those guys who talks back to their TV and expects an answer.;I've received high scores in my two essays, but I have advanced degrees which required a great deal of writing. The fact that you have such a small word count means that you need to develop your essay in a concise manner. Here are some ideas:--Learn your grammar rules, especially how to use COMMAS, and the use of singular and plural pronouns (try this: Choosing between singular and plural pronouns for dummies)--Have at least three paragraphs with an introduction, supporting arguments/quotations and a conclusion. You don't need a title, which I saw in a couple of essays. Your thesis should be clearly stated in the first couple of sentences and repeated in a similar form, after you have supported it, in your conclusion. Do not go off on tangents. I have seen this several times, where the essay starts off well and then the rest of the essay has nothing to do with the original thesis. Don't try to cover too many different ideas in an essay of this size, pick one topic and develop it.--Re-read your work OUT LOUD. You will discover that some words are missing or misspelled (saw this is several essays.)--Rewrite several times. I create a draft with my main ideas and in the next couple of days I will add quotes and delete others, tightening the concept as I go.--Remember your audience. These are your peers grading your paper and they might enjoy humor or a personal aside. I loved the comment someone left me that turned my entire thesis on its head and really made me think. That person gave me a high grade for my rationale, but I loved that they had a totally different take on the topic!--Avoid using words that you commonly use in conversation and should be avoided at all costs in critical essays. For example: ""so"" (oy vey, this is SO overused), ""like"" (as in, visualize a Valley Girl speaking), ""you know"", etc.I've had three kids in college (one currently in medical school, one in grad school and one who is a junior) and they were, without a doubt, terrible writers as freshmen. By their senior year, their writing had developed nicely and all three agree that creating a draft and rewriting are the keys to an ""A"" paper. My daughter published a biology research paper in college and that required an entirely different style of writing which was directed at a totally different audience (I could barely understand the abstract.) A few people are naturally talented writers, but for most of us it  requires effort and practice. My brother-in-law is a successful mystery  novelist and you should see how many re-writes his editor has him do  before the novel is ready to go to print. Writing styles vary depending on the topic. Literary criticism is different from technical writing (have you read a Microsoft Word manual lately?), just as a bill in Congress is written differently from the speech that the President (or his speech writer) wrote for the State of the Union. These were all written for a different audience and purpose.It is unfortunate that students in this course can't get direct feedback from the professor because that is how my children learned to write in college, but hopefully some of the reviews will give useful feedback. I do spend time on my reviews, but others may not have the luxury of that available time.;Thank you.  This is great info.  Thanks for sharing. ;In case an example might help, my essay received a 3 for form (which I don't think it deserved) and a 2 for content:  On the surface,  Alice In Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  are playful tales for children:   Alice enters two dream worlds and encounters fantastic characters and events there.   It may seem all in good fun, but the absurdity and fearful situations Alice encounters can be considered metaphors for the existential horror of everyday life.   Consider, for example, the imagery of transformation from animal to human, animate to inanimate, and vice versa, and how in the novels eating is symbolic of the destructiveness inherent in everyday life.For example, cards and chess pieces assume human qualities, then revert back to their inanimate forms, Alice shakes the Red Queen into a kitten, when Alice's neck grows to an absurd length the Pigeon questions whether she is a serpent or a human, and the Duchess' baby morphs into a piglet.   The boundaries among animal, human, and inanimate are flexible and fluid.   Although these transformations are playful, even magical, the constantly shifting categories create an element of existential uncertainty and dread.   When the rules of logic no longer apply, the unpredictability leaves the reader anticipating the next transformation and how the story will unfold, but there is also a sense that, from Alice's perspective the entire scenario could change into something horrific.   To survive in this constantly shifting world, one must master the Mock Turtle's curriculum of ""ambition, distraction, uglification.""   The shifts invite the reader to consider the perspective of characters other than protagonist Alice, including those who become food. The Lobster Quadrille and the Walrus and the Carpenter who danced with, then ate, ""every one"" of the unfortunate lobsters, are emblematic of the constant betrayals lurking below the surface niceties of everyday life.   Beneath the surface, our world, and relationships, are as broken, and as irreparable, as is Humpty Dumpty.   Beneath the surface, the novels are dark fables.   ;How did Harker get away?   Where is it described?;Thanks.   After I finished the book, I was looking for the description.   I think it is a major omission.   The detailed description of h is imprisonment, and plans for escape, the leading up to it, then nothing about how he got from the castle to being nursed by the good sisters.   You would think he would at least have had a conversation with Mina about it.;I was a bit disappointed with the Count, he didn't fight for his live! Moreover, he decided to run away, back to Transylvania!;He who turns and runs away, lives to fight another day.;I found the novel a bit of a bore, and I have a very high tolerance for boredom.     Imagine some hack filtering his world view through the cheap psychology of Dr. Phil while he writes a novel on his TV tray.     That is the Victorian era equivalent we find in Stoker.     No deep insights, bad pacing, very repressed characters (hard to believe he was a fan of Walt Whitman).       Van Helsing should have read more Kierkegard.     I would have found him more believable plowing 40 acres in   Minnesota than playing Socrates to three uptight British gentlemen and an American who fetishises Winchesters.       ;I just...

It is not only on a language level.           I am not sure if schools in every country planting the same structure of written work to the students heads. As a result we have different expectations, and from there we receiving conflicts , misunderstanding and resentmen. That is why this forum and your comments are so important. I really appreciate your help. ;Precious information. Are we have here more teachers from around the world to explain to us exact rules of the academic writing (traditional in their countries )? It will be very helpful ( especially for the grading and establishing more  understanding between fellow classmates). I believe misunderstanding can backfire in both ways. Students, who have a solid knowledge in US writing standards can mark down the work of the people who do not have such a knowledge . In other hand, classmates, who have different values and academic experience , according to this values and experience, can mark down the work of US students . Classic cultural confrontation , as Romans and Barbarians: should you wear pants or you should not? ;This combination of motive sometimes turns into real fights over which country owns  the first version of the folk tale. For Russians Afanasiev's compilation overshadows Grimm's tales.  ;Some great observations here--I teach on the university level (I'm teaching a World Lit class right now and we'll be watching Spirited Away and discussing its influences in a week or two) and I can tell you that at least one Japanese scholar, Ando Satoshi, wrote a journal  article on the connection between Spirited Away and Alice's Adventures  in Wonderland.I also noticed the similarities to the Russian and Slavic Baba Yaga. While researching Spirited Away's roots in Japanese folklore, I found out that there is a Japanese mountain withc/deity who corresponds very closely to the EAstern European Baba Yaga. If you are interested in learning more about Spirited Away and Japanese folklore and mythology, and if you can get access to academic databases, you can check out an article by Thomas Keirstead which will tell you more.;Anyone who's watched the professor's lecture on color symbolism would know that orange is usually meant to represent childhood. This is why the first Disney theme parks were built in Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida--two traditional sources of oranges. The fact that the marmalade jar was empty foreshadows the loss of innocence accompanied by Alice's maturity. Note her reluctance to part with the jar, even as she clung to the remaining vestiges of a child's experiences. She has already consumed the orange marmalade, unknowingly, through her childhood experiences up to that point. Putting the jar back into a cupboard marks a suspension of her ordinary experience during a journey into adulthood.;but is it marmalade?;Over interpretation is really exist when it  is totally out of the context and comon sence and taken out of the thin air. And unlike the bright idea it is often dull repetition of the popular theme of the day.(for exemple : sexuality everywhere , including "" Alice in Wonderland ""). ;I'll agree with every point you have just made, adding only that children of all ages, once aware of the world and a mis-deed [e.g. they are aware of what right and wrong is on a simple level] can start picking up the 'darker' threads. Peter Pan is very dark, but it is when these stories are made into mainstream quick-media [Disney films, pantomimes, comics* simplified version stories - this is the bad guy - say boo etc, ] that the darkness is transferred into lighter comedy horror - the step-mother is still terrifying but she is obviously the evil character now.*Comics in the sense of a few pages of quick story rather than the actual medium of graphic literature which can be as complex, if not more so, than novella.;Sean - thank you for clarifying the point - I, like anonymous had an issue with this but fully agree with your point.;Yes, thank you, Sean, you expalined that beautifully, especially the part about how your brain is tricked by the illusion the mirror creates. That helps a lot. I think we mean the same thing, the image you see on the back of the paper is the image on the front of the paper if you invert it on the lateral axis, like a mirror does, which again is in the way the image is handled, of course.Mirrors are confusing and I still find them a little creepy sometimes. Maybe my next essay will be about them. Also, since this is a literary forum, can I recommend a short story this reminds me of? It's  'Midnight in the Mirror World', by Fritz Leiber. That spooked the life out of me.;Sean, I suggest you think again about mirrors. Do the following experiment: take a pair of gloves and go stand in front of a mirror; look at the image of your left hand and try to fit one of the gloves to it. You will find that only the right glove fits the image of your left hand. Hence the image of your left hand is indeed a right hand. Mirror image. Note, however, that your thumb stays on the same side with respect to, say, your little finger. That takes care of your faulty argument about direction indicators not being reversed when seen in a rear-view mirror. Finally, ask yourself why in many countries 'Police' or 'Ambulance' is written backwards on the hoods of the corresponding vehicles.;I expect Lewis Carrol would very much enjoy this and would be incredibly proud of causing all the confusion. Do mirrors reverse things? Don't they?   What does it mean if they do, what if they don't? I think the reason he liked the looking glass enough to put it the book is exactly because it messes with people's minds and makes them doubt their logic and reality, not because mirrors reverse, or they don't. This is probably more in the spirit of the books than any kind of analysis really.  ;Sean, why deny the evidence? Chirality comes up all the time in the sciences. In chemistry, mirror image molecules are identical in mass, composition, etc yet one can separate the left- from the right-handed molecules and they often have different reactivities, toxicity, etc. Sean himself is largely made of chiral molecules, as we all are. Try a diet of d-aminoacids and soon there won't be a Sean to deny chirality. You claim your gloves are symmetrical? What an incredibly lame excuse for not doing the simple experiment that would force you to reconsider! I imagine you own a pair of shoes. Pick it up and do as suggested above: you will find that your right shoe fits the image of your left foot. And don't tell me you can't do the experiment because you don't have a full-size mirror... By the way, all this has been worked out a long time ago by the branch of maths called topology. Look it up, focusing on the differences between symmetry with respect to a point and symmetry with respect to a plane. ;Sean, let's not talk about being offensive: this is after all an academic debate and, as such, it should be fierce and merciless. That's because the ante is so small. Therefore, I must take exception with your statement that 'chirality.... does not have anything to do with mirrors'. Chirality results when two of the substituents on an asymmetric carbon atom are switched around, A taking B's place and vice versa, so that the l- and d-isomers are mirror images. Obviously, it is not because they are mirror images that their properties differ; but it is because the two substituents are switched around that they are mirror images. Moreover, much as I love Prof. Rabkin's lectures, I object when he says that Martin Gardner errs when discussing mirrors in his AnAl. Gardner was a mathematician and knew his topology. Gardner was also very critical of the lazy passe-partout literary psycho-babble that sees obvious sexual symbolism in anything elongated (a pencil) or shaded (a grove) or moist (moss on a river bank)... That sort of analysis was perhaps novel and amusing in the 1920's but today it's become the absolute clich  .;Let's see if we can find what we agree on.Alice is standing in front of a mirror. Kitty is to her right. In the mirror, we see MirrorAlice and MirrorKitty. MirrorKitty seems to be to the left of MirrorAlice because the image is flipped. But MirrorKitty is still to the right of actual Alice. So maybe the actual question is, what do you consider 'reverse' to be.Anyway, the reason I started this thread is because Professor Rabkin made no sense to me when he talked about the mirror part, and the left and right part, and I don't mean the good Lewis-Carroll-no-sense way. The both of you are making a lot more sense even with the conversation a little heated.;Ive read through two different essays that are arguing that there is no point to Alice in Wonderland - no deeper meaning, no symbolism, no allegory, no parody - that it is just pure nonsense for the sake of nonsense. Im honestly not sure how to grade them in the content portion. The essays didn't really convince me at all, but I don't want to mark them down just because I don't agree. Im looking for opinions here to see how others would mark them. ;They aren't badly written, but all they made me think of were counterexamples. I think Im struggling with the fact that it is widely agreed that Alice is full of symbolism and social commentary. The essays have similar arguments against that, but they don't make sense. I don't know how to explain what I mean by that without posting a sample, but I don't think that would be fair of me. ;I think I probably looked at one of those too.   I would look at how well written the argument is and if they have clear examples.

For Walton it's how much he longs to conquer the north (yes, we get that, too), how much he loves Victor and so on. For the monster it is how much he wants to belong somewhere, how he wants to get back at Victor and so on. For Victor, it is mostly how desperate he is.

However, the third paragraph was very well written, and it connected the poem he/she was talking about to the novel, albeit in a completely different way. I ended up giving this person a 1 for content. What I want to know is was that the right grade to give, would a 2 have been better?  ;Oh.;I got a 2 for form and 2 for content but the grade they showed was 4.

What I will say is what it did for the genre of science-fiction. Purportedly, it created it. Electricity could make a corpse move after death.

Please elaborate.;Interesing theory.   She didn't kill them, though, and she was a victim herself, part of the undead, so I see Dracula himself as the main culprit.   Perhaps only women could use children as victims.   Or perhaps she was giving birth to children the only way possible for her.   Had she lived, her victims would have become like her, so her legacy would continue.   Why only the women vampires interested in children victims?

Both voldemort and Dracula are concerned with dominion, too,  and like Dracula,  Voldemort is all about breaking into places. ;You should have written ""deceased"" meaning dead, not ""diseased"" meaning suffering from a malady.

In John Seward's journals, Stoker writes about Renfield, a mentally ill patient who eats living things with the belief that he will absorb their lives. Seward writes that Renfield  ""gave many flies to one spider, and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps?""  This is in reference to the Darwinian ideas surrounding the survival of the fittest. It is suggested that Renfield might consume the cat, but Seward's curiosity encourages the reader to question the belief that humans are the apex predators of the food chain. If Renfield eats the cat, would another species in the future evolve to eat the human?  Renfield's behaviour is animalistic in nature and runs parallel to Dracula, who behaves in a similar way to achieve sustenance. He consumes living things to survive, the only difference being that he drains the blood from humans. Significantly, when Mina first sees Dracula, she struggles to decipher whether he is  ""man or beast"". Stoker intentionally portrays similar behaviour between the characters in order to imply that they are not that different. This reminds the reader of Darwin's suggestion that humans evolved from Apes.  Stoker later shows Renfield having an attack of conscience as he tries to help save Mina. This contrasts with Dracula   s behaviour as Dracula feels no remorse for his actions. This key difference between the two characters is ultimately what separates man from ""beast"". It poses questions for how the human mind may evolve in the future to account for this possible weakness, suggesting that the idea of humans evolving in to ""beasts"" is plausible. Exactly how different are we from the supernatural monsters so frequently portrayed in literature?Form:peer 1      Interesting paper - I enjoyed reading it. It was well written. Have you thought whether there are any examples in the book that contradict your theory? The thesis that Stoker was influenced by Darwin may be weak - we didn't necessarily gain any insight into how Dracula was created to understand whether he was an evolved human and Renfield's ""evolution"" within the asylum doesn't pay off in the sense he doesn't change completely (not that one would, as it would take generations per Darwin). Also, man, as unevolved, conquers vampire, as evolved, which is directly contrary to Darwin (other than there is a process...).peer 2      Excellent form. Ideas were portrayed clearlypeer 3      Clear, simple structure with ideas flowing logically.

Also, if Darwin was the underlying theme, is the conclusion of the novel that religion, or Christianity, conquers evolution?peer 2      Good parallels and illustrations to strengthen your argumentpeer 3      Interesting ideas with relevant supporting examples. I would have liked this essay to have a longer word limit and so you could develop this topic further!peer 4      This essay is brilliant! I loved the comparison between Renfield and Dracula and I loved the parallel with evolution. I also love the fact that you wrote something about Renfield. We tend to forget him! Very different and insightful!peer 5      While I think your thesis statement is interesting, and one I haven't thought of before in regards to Dracula, I, personally, see several issues with it, specifically in your information. Survival of the fittest is not about the food chain. It means that certain individuals of a specific species are more adapted to a specific environment and thus able to survive while others do not. These survivors breed and pass on those traits to their offspring, strengthening the species for that environment. It's about adaptability, not animals of different species consuming each other as predator and prey. Also, a common misconception is that Darwin claimed humans descended from modern apes. Not true. Claimed apes and humans had a common ape-like ancestor. Like I said, interesting theory, but if you're going to use that argument, should probably do some reading up on Darwin and evolution first. Just my opinion. :)I really appreciated the comments for my essay. I also agree that there are issues with my thesis. If I didn't have a word limit, I would have explored further to include counter arguments etc. I guess I was guilty of trying to find specific things to say (and quotes from the text) in attempts to support my thesis, knowing that I only had up to 320 words. I'd like to write a longer essay on this one I think! Thank you for your comments, you've given me things to think about!;I'm actually really pissed off that I didn't receive a 5 for my essay. I received the lowest mark I've ever had so far. I don't understand how I didn't score a 3 for the form section. ""Use commas when required""...? My essay is rife with commas.Johnathan Harker: A Journey to Manhood The first glimpse of Johnathan Harker shows him as a young man who  has    recently grown into manhood    under the service of Peter Hawkins. It  is evident that he has not yet fully acknowledged this transformation  as he accidentally refers to himself as a solicitor   s clerk. It is  possible that he may not be comfortable in his role as a    full-blown  solicitor    as he feels he needs to grow more in terms of his  experiences. In 19th century London, he has yet to marry and establish himself within his company in order to complete his journey to manhood. Despite being capable of exercising his skills concerning legal  matters, he still portrays the na  vet   and disobedience of a young boy.  This is evident when he ignores the warnings of the locals and also when  he feels a twisted enjoyment when going against the Count   s wishes of  sleeping somewhere other than his designated room. During his time at the castle, he is engaged to Mina. Considering the 19th  century setting it can be assumed that they intend to consummate their  relationship in their marital bed. Mina herself comments in one of her  letters that marriage signifies settling down    soberly into old married [women]   ,  thus acknowledging it as a step to adulthood. Johnathan   s ordeal and  recovery in hospital, his sudden marriage and the death of his dear  friend Peter Hawkins force him into maturity on an emotional and  intellectual level. In addition to this, he feels like a    new man    when  Van Helsing confirms what he experienced to be true. Johnathan transforms from a man who takes directions from others to a  man who takes control of situations and joins the coalition against the  Count. Ancient hunters and young warriors were considered men upon  completion of their first kill. Johnathan shears the Count   s throat,  thus completing his journey to manhood.Grade: 4FORMpeer 1      Very good structure and grammar usage, with slight errors at certain  instances (The first glimpse).

Sorry I don't have any real input for improvement.peer 5     This is  satisfactory analysis of the student's chosen topic. ;Essay: Vampires have the power to change you into one of them, and when     that happens, you lose who you are and become something monstrous. Another     way to lose your sense of self is by going mad. A homicidal maniac is another     type of monster. The affliction of madness comes up a few different times     in Dracula, and shows us the dangers of being a fanatic. Jonathan's temporary insanity is caused by fear. He is afraid that what     he saw could not have happened. He is afraid that he does not understand     how the world works after all. His fear goes deeper though, into the Problem     of Evil. How can a devout man reconcile the presence of such evil creatures     as those he saw, and at the same time believe in a God who would never     allow such a creature to exist? He cannot wrap his mind around the question     because he cannot let go of either belief. It is that which makes him go     mad. The mental patient Renfield has clearly been bitten. He eats increasingly     larger animals to sustain himself because he cannot bring himself to bite     a human. His crisis is one of spirituality as well. He cannot bite a human     victim for fear of mortal soul, but cannot release the vampire's hold on     him either. Renfield prays to Dracula,""I am here to do your bidding, Master...     and you will not pass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distribution     of good things?""(112). Here, he is asking for the assurance of immortality     that in his mind will save his soul since he feels he is lost to God. In both cases, the allusions to Christianity and fanaticism are present.     Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.     It is a lesson that would have been scandalous in Victorian Europe, which     is why it is hidden in symbolism rather than overt. Form: peer 1     You have raised different line of thought at the same time,     although you try to centralize on madness but unfortunately you couldn   t     powerfully reinforced this. peer 2     Good vocabulary and grammar. You should     think carefully about the purpose of each word and sentence and verify     if they are connected to the rest of the essay. in the last paragraph you     say: ""Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.""     but you didnt explore the issue of ""rigid belifs"" previously. peer 3         The structure is not fully clear to me. This e.g. concerns the reference     to christianity. peer 4     The student makes good use of grammar, punctuation     and references to the text. Although be careful of your spelling (""ridgid""     when it should be rigid). peer 5     Fairly strong essay in grammar and structure.Content: peer 1     Following your line of argument, you have deep understanding     of the work and your line of argument is valid but you couldn   t just deliver     it persuasively peer 2     I enjoyed that you brought up the issue of madness,     its an amazing topic.But I had difficulty to compare/contrast the madness     of Johnathan and the mental patient Renfield. peer 3     Interesting idea.     During the text you develop the link of various aspects in a nice way.     Maybe the Essay could be improved if you further lmit it to one element.     peer 4     Relating madness to one's beliefs makes for an interesting thesis.     Well done. peer 5     Point made about Jonathan's temporary insanity being     tied to his inability to rationalize how God would allow such evil to exist     is rather juvenile.;So far nobody could tell I am not a native...

During the day, like right now, I'm supposed to be writing reviews that impact what my associates are actually earning for their living.      The rubric I have to use includes negative things that they have to improve on.    I feel like a heel sometimes, but everybody has something to improve on.;Another perspective:I see the peer review as a way of learning more by reading other people's work and evaluating it.   I don't necessarily expect to learn from other people's comments on my work.   If I happen to get an interesting comment from a particularly good grader, that's just an added bonus.-anitra;I have also been really disappointed with the peer reviews. Perhaps I was looking forward to them too much. I do think that some things can be learned from them, but I am beginning to change my mind about the students giving marks. For one thing, there has been a ton of discussion about HOW to give marks, and how to give the correct percentages, and not being able to mark a 0 even if an essay is plagiarized or has nothing to do with the topic.....I mean, no offense to the Professor, but I have seen a lot more effective systems in other MOOCs. There is way too much confusion and negativeness surrounding the numbers.;I actually think it is really disrespectful for you to complain about only getting a 4 or a 4.5.

I was trying to inject some levity with my post. And if you read Game of Thrones, you learn that weakness is not simply physical, mental, or economic prowess, sometimes it boils down to those who have a high opinion of themselves and are downright cruel. And at least to an American like me, it's always about competition. We see five different examples of writing. If you use that as your spectrum of skill, that makes the grading competitive.

Also, although the verb tenses agree, the sentence structure is grammatically incorrect apart from the word usage you pointed out. I would hazard a guess too, that the phrase this reviewer used was something he or she picked up somewhere, and thought it made him or her sound academically literate. Of course, it only serves the opposite purpose when one is not even proficient writing simple sentences. I can't comment on the terseness and simplicity suggestion because I haven't read your essay; but if it makes you feel any better, I once applied terminology by using the expression 'dual opposites' to convey the idea of twofold oppositions, and got the same reaction.           ;I didn't get a chance to read all of the comments above (there are a lot of them!), but generally, I agree with your frustrations. I was very, very displeased with the reviewers comments for my first essay because three of the four did not say ANYTHING about what I did well.   Like someone else pointed out, the professor states that we should provide constructive criticism AND include something that the writer did well.   On that particular essay, I was criticized for using the passive voice, when in fact, I was using the active voice! I can't remember the exact sentence that was used by the reviewer to make his point, but the sentence was written in active voice, and I think it was written in the present progressive tense. This must have confused the reviewer. It just really bothers me to be criticized for doing something wrong when I know it wasn't wrong. Plus, like others mentioned, it's difficult to swallow some of these reviews not knowing what kind of credentials these fellow students have. No offense to the very young fellow students in this class, but I don't see how a 12-year-old is going to be able to assess me on my grammatical structure. I think it's great that individuals this young are embarking on this educational journey, so I don't mean to be rude in this regard. I would feel much differently if I knew a professor was the one grading my essays.;In my essay on Dracula by Bram Stoker,   I tried to look at the novel and the author's motivation in a new light.   I'm sure most of you have heard   the different themes, symbols, etc. that have been discussed over the years.   The fear and desire, attraction and repulsion, the sexuality...the list goes on and on.   In looking at the novel as a good horror story and considering that perhaps that was the intention of the author, I apparently hit a nerve with some people.   To answer the question, have you read the book - yes, several times.   I thought that this class was about writing to enlighten our peers and, while I may not be a very good writer, I do try to look at these stories in a new way.    In response to the comment that I shouldn't discuss non-literary topics - I wasn't aware that discussing the possibility that Dracula was just a  really good horror story written by an imaginative man from bits and pieces he probably gathered during his travels was discussing a non-literary topic.    I do understand that many of you may be more experienced in writing these essays, but let me remind you that some of us are 54 years old and due to circumstances were not able to attend college.   I am here to learn but I don't think commenting that an essay is ""...not entertaining or provocative...it is lackluster."" is very helpful to the writer.   This is especially so as no suggestions were made that might have been helpful.For those of you that did make suggestions on how to improve the essay, thank you very much.;Unless you've seen Farscape, you may not get this (I do it not to offend those sensitive to true profanity), but:Frell'em.

I know in my last essay on Frankenstein I was told that abortion is a mordern issue and should not have been used. However, abortion did exist in the 1800s. It was viewed as socially unacceptable, however it was there. So to say mentioning abortion when discussing the parent child relationship between characters in Frankenstein  is not a modern view. I think an open dialogue could have cleared up that assumption and help with future issues like plagerism questions or concerns. A lot of poeple seem to be having issues with the peer evaluations.  ;I get tired of people who don't read the entire piece it seems. For instance, I said ""This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world"". Then went on to say that is the core reason behind Frankenstein destorying the second creature and places him in the role of a mother in relationship to the creatures. I had one reviewer who said it was a weak argument even if it was relevant because there are many reasons for abortions. There are, but that is why I used the word some and, in the context of the argument, that is the one that fits because the essay was about parent-child relationships NOT abortion. It was just one aspect. There seems to be qualifiers that are missed and people are interpreting statements as absolutes.  ;Hey, I just got accused of plagiarizing from my own writing, whatever that could possibly mean.;I just want to say, after reading The Raven so many times, it's such an ear-bug.

I can accept multiple theses or a multi-part thesis, but if there isn't some sort of unifying statement, the whole thing just rambles.   I don't know if this is just my own personal bias, but almost all of the essays I've read that have a clear thesis and follow it are excellent.   They're easy to follow and intelligent.   So many I read that don't have one are unfocused.   Plus, the way I was taught in school, for it to be an essay it has to have a thesis.   The Work Expectations page does say something about this. It says ""using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be.""   The stuff on the actual peer review page talks about whether the argument is persuasive and if it is well supported.   Some of these essays don't have an argument.   ;This is something that confuses me too as I believe on most weeks I have only received the feedback of 4 peers; it seems wrong if I am reviewing 5 or more to only have 4 come back...;Most have heard that E.A. Poe gets some cognac left on his grave every year.       Just wanted to give a shout out to Nathaniel Hawthorne on his birthday.Favorite Hawthorne quote?     Mine is from a letter to his sister upon the birth of his son Julian:     : ""A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew.""Hawthorne was not who most of us think he was having been force fed The Scarlett Letter in High School.My favorite story (of the assigned readings) was The Artist of the Beautiful.     He seems to be saying that you write, you create, for yourself, and not with some audience in mind, because that butterfly you send fluttering out is going to be crushed by some troglodyte.;As writers we learn the importance of characterization in the impact of the story, and within characterization we learn the importance of motivations. Shelley motivates her characters beyond every writer that I have encountered so far.Shelley devotes the first three chapters, 67 pages (twenty percent of the book,) to characterizing Victor by depicting the circumstances that shaped his character.As for technique, Shelley motivatesa. In layers: if an action of Victor   s father was crucial in motivating Victor, Shelley also gives the father   s motivations, and sometimes more layers. For example: Shelley provides motivation on why Victor   s mother adopted Elizabeth: because she had endured poverty and was relieved out of it by Victor's father marrying her. Shelley motivates beyond that and tells us why she was in poverty, why Victor's father married her, and again in another level, her father's misfortune in his merchant career, and also Elizabeth   s history.  b.  By multiple reasons: Shelley doesn   t stop if she provided one reason for an action. She gives reasons until we would be surprised if the action didn   t happen. For example: When Elizabeth is adopted into Victor's family, Shelley gives three motivations for Victor   s lack of sibling rivalry: 1. He is showered, and always was, with parental love. 2. Elizabeth is extraordinarily kind. 3. His mother gives her to him as a present, his own to love and cherish. This pattern repeats for every action that Shelley motivates.  c.  Using mini-stories: such as the story of the merchant who was the father of Victor   s mother. These mini-stories have their beginning, middle, and end, with a flavor of oral fairy tales. They deliver stand-alone pleasures adding to the overall impact.In my view, the mini-story technique with its added pleasures, presents a crucial element in propelling the extensive, multi-reason, multi-layer motivating pages Shelley provides.;   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre. But at the same time, it gives certain critical messages in a subtle and cunning way.It expresses the status of women writers in that period. The fact that Mary Shelley chose three narrators for the story telling and all of them being male; the passive women characters; our notions about them being moulded by the perceptions of the    male    narrators and finally Victor creating the    creature    without the involvement of women; all point towards the fact that women were unrepresented or underrepresented in the literary society of that period in which intellectual was synonymous with men and women were meant to be the angels at home.Moreover, women not being involving in the creation might be a reaction to Erasmus Darwin who blamed women for all monstrous births.It also shows what happens when science crosses its limits and men break the laws of nature to become gods (creators). Men make discoveries and inventions, leading to uncontrollable applications which turn disastrous.Again, in a less visible manner the story displays the ill effects of extreme ambition and lack of patience. Had Victor been patient in creating the creature using proper body parts, he would not have been a monster (   As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature   ). Although Victor apparently wanted to be a benefactor, he was always concerned about his own glory and thought him of more ability than he actually was (  _first success to permit me to doubt of my    ability    to give life  _).To sum it all,    Frankenstein    is a wonderful novel with meaningful messages.FORMpeer 1      You have satisfactory structure and you are able to support your arguments. Though, you have some grammatical mistakes and it would be better if you had done some research and had used references.peer 2      There are some sentences with structure problems, e.g. ""   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre"" - this sentences needs to be broken into at least 2 to be less confusing or to have a more accurate punctuation. Another example ""Moreover, women not being involving [involved] in the creation"" In general, the ideas are comprehensible and the author shows a good use of vocabulary, connectors and grammar.peer 3      The first sentence doesn't make sense. To establish a book as a novel of horror genre, you don't need numerous imitations and parodies. Maybe, you were trying to say something else. Anyway, I think the structure and the grammar are good.peer 4      A few grammatical errors; you divide your essay into logical, effective paragraphs. However, I could not find an overarching thesis or argument in your essay, so while your divisions between topics were clear, your paragraphs did not relate to a specific argument/goal.peer 5      Although it was nice that your paragraphs weren't blocky, I think some of the sentences should have been incorporated into their own paragraphs rather than standing alone. I would also be careful with ending paragraphs with a quote instead of analysis.CONTENTpeer 1      Your first idea about passive women is a very interesting topic. I would advise you to fathom this concept more, instead of trying to discuss a new topic, as you are doing after the first two paragraphs.peer 2      The main point is compelling and it makes for an interesting idea. However, last paragraph and conclusion seem unrelated to the main topic. In such a short essay it is not very recommendable to have various topics. It could be much productive and convincing to stick to one main argument.peer 3      I find it interesting that Shelley used only men as narrators, and it's a good point. The passive nature of women, the limits of science, and the ill effect of ambition, are all hidden inside the novel. But your essay could be better if it was aiming only on one theme.peer 4      In all of your paragraphs/subtopics, you make valid and effective arguments; however, your lacking a single theme overall for your essay prevents these different areas of interest from coming together into a logical argument. While the reader's understanding of the novel is enriched by your essay, your essay itself lacks a ""point"".peer 5      While you touched on a lot of interesting topics, I think you could strengthen your essay by narrowing your focus onto one topic and examining it in detail. I would also caution against using your subjective opinion about the novel in a literary essay.TOTAL 3;I found the parent-child relationships, specifically along the lines of abandonment, in  Frankenstein. This is shown in more ways than just the abandonment of the creature by Victor. Justine   s mother abandons her, while Elizabeth   s mother dies and her father leaves her with an uncle. In relation the creature, he feels like Victor, who can be seen as God or his father, has abandoned him. This leaves the creature to learn and develop without any guidance or teachings to help in determining how to properly interact with people or what is right and wrong. Victor consistently neglects his responsibility to love and protect his child-creature. This is the first instance of rejection the creature experiences. Each one the follows increases his anger and pain. It also serves to remind him of the first rejection, the rejection of his father and creator, and he does not understand the proper way to wrestle with these emotions. When Victor chooses to destroy the bride, the only companion the creature feels could possibly accept him, it is not different than an abortion. It is the destruction of life, or the potential life, before    birth   . This reinforces the idea that it is a parent-child relationship. While there are times when God in the Bible has destroyed his creations, it always based on the sins of those involved. In Victor   s case, he does not want to bring another creature into the world. This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world and raise it. Given his history, it is doubtful Victor would have treated this one any differently. The pain the first creation feels can then be seen as much more than just the loss of a companion. It was the loss of a sister, the loss of family. This would be even more painful given the fact it was his own   father that destroyed her.  ;This is my latest effort. What I found interesting was the peer reviews, the shortest I've received yet. Peer 1 and peer 3 only wrote in the last box. If they are this short now, I wonder what they'll be like by the time of the Doctorow book!Any comments on the essay would be appreciated :)HMary Shelley wrote  Frankenstein  as a clever allegory of the French Revolution, the event that caused a seismic shift in the intellectual culture of England. It was the French Revolution that had had a profound influence of her parents, the philosopher William Godwin and feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, who had lived through the Revolution's hopes and despairs, and who had written powerful social commentaries on the events on the continent. The novel can be seen as a homage to their beliefs.The main events in  Frankenstein  mirror the circumstances of the Revolution. Before the creation of the Being/Revolution, there was a period of enlightenment and intellectual struggle against old traditional belief systems, best seen in the novel by Frankenstein's time at university. Victor Frankenstein represents reformers who were swept along by the revolutionary events. Initial there is a period of fear for the future and for many a worry of going too far, as when Frankenstein ran from the monster that he had created. As with the revolutionaries Danton and Robespierre, he saw the dangers of the forces he had unleashed. Yet, as Robespierre was to become tyrannical in creating the Terror, so Frankenstein, in his destruction of the Being's half-constructed partner, also acted repressively, which caused a wave of violence that destroyed all that was close to him.In the end, the ideals of the Revolution burnt out, with France, and much of the rest of Europe, returning to the traditionalist fold. Similarly, the Being ends its life, going to the northern wastelands, saying 'soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascent my funeral pile triumphantly...the light of that conflagration will fade away'. The novel ends with the words 'lost in darkness and distance', representing a loss of the ideals of the Revolution, itself an Enlightenment-created monster.M. Shelley,  Frankenstein  (London, 1818)R.

It was fun doing it though :);Academic works oftentimes use footnotes, end notes and a bibliography (sometimes one or two or all of them, depending on the work) and the works cited box doesn't specify bibliography only, so I don't see a problem with it, but I'm not 100% sure.   ;I feel the same way. One of my reviewers said that I relied on quotes too much when I only used THREE. I feel like there's no pleasing people. If I use quotes, I rely on them too much. If I don't, then I get marked down for not using them. And another reviewer said that my theme was ""shallow"". I'm so sorry my theme wasn't all ~deep and meaningful~ for you. Just because you don't resonate with my theme it doesn't mean that you should mark me down for it.;I agree. This was my first essay, I did not write any before because I was pretty busy, but I am genuinely thrilled with comments, both positive and negative. It really helped a lot and I can see the points made and where I went wrong in my writing.  I would also like to say I am sorry if my own assessments were ""lazy"" or too short, I really did everything in a very short time because I did not want to miss the opportunity to continue with this course. Next time, I will try to do better.  Also, one of the comments was regarding my lack of quotations. I read the book in my native language and , as I stated before, had really little time to write the essay. Finding exact quotations and incorporating them in the text would have taken more time that I had on my hands. I will also try to improve that part.  To the anon above: I too got one comment about my essay being somewhat shallow. Lacking depth. It is truly weird, because I gave it a lot of thought. Sure, it lacked structure and my thesis was introduced too late but that does not make it shallow.  I really find it difficult to say all I want to say with 320 words limitation. I know the reasons for the limit, but I do not agree with them. 500 words would be just fine.  ;I understand why some might think citations are needed. What is apparent and obvious to you, might not be apparent and obvious to me. Thus, you cite the part that you are writing about so that everything would be transparent.

Especially when we are writing a 320 words essay, not a 30 pages thesis.;I just find it funny that my essay was considered ""shallow"" when I related how the creation appeared to be a monster on the outside and how Victor was a monster on the inside, and how this led to him abandoning his philosophy.

Since the book Frankenstein was written in British English, and my peers supposedly have read the book as expected, how can they justify telling me my English is wrong when they just read a whole book in British English. Seems very discriminatory to me. Anyway, thanks again for your suggestion. ;This is a literature class but again you have to look at the demographic. They may have read a book in British English, however they may not understand that is the way you write so when they see it outside quotes they take it as typos. Plus, although this is supposed to be higher learning, there are a wide range of ages and professions. Not everyone may have taken a college English class years while others may be about the start their fifth one. I disagree with the standard being set by the book. I do type grey rather gray even though I grew up in US. I am not going to change that because the novel uses a different form. However, I do not expect someone to change their spelling and writing style to fit a BrE text either.  ;I agree with your thought process. I just don't agree with the concept of what you are saying. As a British English speaking literature student, I know there are other types of English out there, so I don't judge either way. It may mean more work for me to check whether my American peers are misspelling or not, but that's only fair. Since this is an advanced undergraduate course (says so in the recommended background part of the course description), my peers should already know these differences. If they don't know this, then they took this course without complying with the requirements of the course, namely being of an advanced undergraduate level. Why should my grades suffer for that. ;Este Post estuvo un poco intenso. Demasiadas pasiones se desataron, demasiados detalles personales.

Personally, I think 320 words is not enough for me to say all I need to say. I know that prof. has said that if wee need more space, something might be wrong, we might be stretching out too much. I do not agree with that. Some of the essays I read had great potential but it was visible that their authors lacked space. That is a pity.

The professor has a really wonderful idea though, of presenting the material in a way that builds upon experimental fact/data/history, so you really think through the development of chemistry, rather than being told, ""This is how you solve this type of problem. Now go do it X more times.""   It really made me appreciate and learn chemistry much more!

In my area, one of the major pages was the subject of a back-and-forth war over the inclusion of one paper. It was a real crowd pleaser, in a good journal and quite subversive (against the established theories) so it made the news. I'm a world-expert in the area but I was editing anonymously (for my own reasons) and suggested caution and inclusion but with a proviso of a requirement for validation. My edits were repeatedly removed and eventually dismissed as the ravings of a bitter student (!) by a senior WikiP 'priest' (it is in a good journal so it must be right) - so I gave up. A year later, the whole paper was discredited as experimentally flawed and retracted under a bit of a scandal of fraud (hence this anonymity now because it is still sensitive). It is still included there in WikiP though!!! So - WikiP is great, I use it myself extensively. It is usually better than expected if you look in an area where you are an expert - I am not knocking Wikipedia, it has become the Encyclopaedia Galactica.  If you had read that entry at a time with my cautious view though, you might have got a different opinion of the paper than when it was 'corrected' by the authorised but actually quite (understandably) naive wiki-staff. Stuff in Wikipedia changes over time. If however, you quote the original references - then people can make up their own minds. It is not dishonest because Wikipedia is not original research and is usually a Frankenstein of opinions (which is usually a good thing because it is self regulating to an extent). However, beware pages that have lots of edits in their history because you may be sampling one battle in a wiki war - and my experience is that wiki wars are won by the people with most time - not most knowledge. Yes - you should read the original if you can, there is much too much 'apostolic referencing' going on in general - you can actually track it by inherited mistakes in references (fun to do). -sermon ends- ;I really thought we could go through this fast:};you can only use 410=(4x4)-(4!/4)as for 11, can't think of anything...;It's written that 4.4 might be used, but only 4 included11=44/(sqrt(4x4));34=4!+(4!/4)+438=44-(4!/4)I believe we might not be able to use square.

I like the History and Art History courses. ;My take is that Wells, who was a Socialist and a member of the Fabian Society (they wouldn't have believed in 'revolutionary change' but a kind of languid change over time) was in fact writing a satire in The Invisible Man not of Science per se, but the Individual against society.     It takes a village to subdue Griffin.     Also, this is a kind of inversion of the Judeo-Christian ethic, with the corporeal becoming incorporeal instead of vice versa.     Griffin is the opposite of the Christ-God, because he dies for his own sins, not for the sins of the community.     He is a kind of negative sacrifice.     The Reign of Terror that Griffin threatens to invoke is meaningful in this context, and I believe refers to Robespierre and the French Revolution, that product of the Age of Reason gone terribly wrong.     People can be just as fanatic and religous about science and reason as they can about religion.     I think Wells loved Science, but you also get the feeling reading these works that he was terrified of a Science unchecked by Ethics (vivisection in both Moreau and the Invisible Man, Moreau and Griffin operating out of culturally sanctioned bounds in both novels etc).     As an aside, what I love about Wells is that you can tell he loves the 'little people'.     The bumpkins and workmen etc.     Griffin despises them.;M. Gonzalez, I think you are right not to trust anonymous posts - I don't think Coursera should allow them.     This kind of ties into the Invisible Man, because anonymity is a sort of invisibility on the internet.       Folks who post anonymously tend to be the ones the most abusive of netiquette.     As for me, I have no nefarious purposes.     I'm trying to use Suaron's ring to do good!       Speaking of which, Plato's dialog on the Ring of Gyges is very relevant to this story and The Lord of the Rings.;In my essay which I just submitted I try to make the case that Griffin is merely an antagonist - the real protagonist/hero of the novel is the people with Kemp as a kind of stand-in.;Both writers and reviewers are evolving.  ;@Poulomi: we also have Yama, the Indian/Hindu version of Hades.

The novel  Black cat  has associations with demons and witchcraft; makes you question where the origins of evil dwell.     Firstly, the cat is demonic. The cats, especially black, are the familiars of witches. Also, its name Pluto relates to the antique god of the underworld. The cat provokes ill     temper, while changing person   s character. Still for the longest time (of all animals) tenderness towards Pluto remains     as a contract between human and devil, whilst devil is nourished with evil deeds,  pet stays affectionate to its owner, but once it is offended,  sets the  fire in the house. So, the cat might be a cause of events.     Also, there might be a presumption that man himself was transforming into devil, while the cat was only a catalyst. This transformation required for the bigger sins     murder of loved ones, which only started with Pluto. Taking out an eye, can be associated to the cat   s night vision, which is almost as seeing other world of impurities,  intimidates main character, that his evil side might be detected.     What is more, the cat has clear relation with the wife. The second cat has spot on fur, and wife   s white hair reminds of it, provokes further evilness. The white itself is ghostly color, or maybe because of its relation to purity, and sense of the need to taint it. When the wife is buried in the cellar the cat disappears. It reappears only when the remains are found, as if linked to the body. Also, wife defends pet with bare hand against axe, and is not offended by ill- temper of her husband, raises suspicion that she might have deeper relations to the causes     the cat and the demons.   We reach few conclusions - either the cat is the cause of demonic behavior, the wife is a witch, either the man is at fault.  FORM:peer 1      I've had to give you a 1 for Form because there were quite a few grammatical errors. The main one is that you often miss out 'the', 'a', 'its', 'his' or 'her' before nouns (e.g. in the fourth paragraph, it should be ""THE second cat has a spot on ITS fur""). Sometimes you're using them but most of the time you miss them out. If you worked on this, it would make a big difference to the essay. There were a couple of other minor errors - in the last sentence you used 'either...either'. It should be 'either...or...' (so ""the wife is a witch OR the man is at fault""). Your vocabulary was good.peer 3      Good attempt however there were quite a few grammatical and vocabulary errors. I think you need a stronger conclusion.peer 4      Several grammar mistakes hinders the clarity of your essay quite significantly. You are missing some small words in sentences, improper placement of commas, or misusing words to name a few.Content:peer 1      You could have expanded your conclusion more but apart from this you had a lot of interesting ideas and managed to fit quite a lot in to your essay. You noticed quite a range of symbolism from even just the cat character. I've given you a 2 for Content.peer 3      I like that you chose to discuss evil however in some parts the argument seemed lost, I feel you might have focused too much on analyzing one story that your examples or motivation for choosing this topic was not as clear. I would suggest that you use Evil as the underlying theme and then look for strong examples from multiple stories to support it, perhaps the absence of Faith in the characters is what creates Evil?peer 4      Your conclusion is obscure, it does not relate back to your thesis. However, I think your content is actually quite good, nice depth in analysis.Total score: 3;I appreciate that you guys read it, even if it is graded lower. The thought about witch got my own attention, which was basically keeping me writing this essay:D;Thank you for corrections, it would be hard to use it for essay, because I barely made through word count. If I had to chose one interpretation, I would chose the most boring one - only about cat itself. How could I not share wife being a witch ( which is a weak interpretation on its own)? If I'm able to see several interpretations why not sharing it.;As for peer 3, I couldn't add more stories because structure now quite logical, one conclusion about origins of evil per paragraph. And I was highly motivated for this topic, because I write fiction myself in related topic.;Nature as the personification of 'woman,' as with Mother Nature (something to be controlled and penetrating its secrets)) - never thought about that!

I am totally impressed!CONTENT  peer 1      The matter of the Unit 5 is not delved into. You stay at the surface of the tales. You have not analyzed in depth any argument of the stories. You only named a couple of titles and made a summary of respective plots.peer 2      Your poem was lovely, but it did make it a bit harder to find the thesis. You did a good job considering your self-imposed constraints, but I think you could have had a meatier argument if you'd written an essay.peer 3      You didn't really add many thoughts beyond summaries of a couple of stories. There wasn't an in-depth analysis of any work, and you seemed to write mostly about the reading process in general.peer 4      Best essay EVER!!! Hooray! I wish I could give you more than a 3!

Because you ask this frequently. You are damned by the very thought that you are mad. It is not me whom you are asking it; you doubt and question yourself.  Again you hear things in heaven, earth and hell. The disease which has sharpened your senses is    madness   .  How! How! Didn   t I tell the story healthily and calmly?  So, you think, telling a story calmly makes you sane. And killing a man calmly and quietly hides your insanity. Are you trying to fool me? You killed an old man just because of what appears to be a cataract. Or was it his gold that compelled you?  No, no! It was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.  You consider the old mad and his eye as two discrete identities. And you are sane?  Didn   t you notice with what dexterity I committed the crime? Can a madman do this?    You are whimsical!  You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings. And why are you troubled many a night, just at midnight, when all the world sleeps?  You thought the neighbours would hear his heart but you yourself yelled while attacking? Is it the perfect way of doing a crime? The only thing you wanted was him to look at you, with his eye so that your blood would run cold and you could do a cold blooded murder.  Don   t mock me. I must scream or die! And now again!     hark! Louder! Louder! Louder! Louder!-  It   s not his heart that you listen, it   s yours. It   s your guilt that needs confession. In the     Tale Tell heart    it   s your heart that is telling the story. The old man is dead, stone dead.         peer 3      Last paragraph: ""you hear"", not ""you listen"". Glad you made the mistake as it made the essay more your own.  peer 4      Accurately and clearly written - an interesting pastiche of Poe.  peer 5      I'm not exactly sure how to rate your essay. It does not meet the expectations of an academic essay, and yet, I can't help to recognize the brilliance of your stream of consciousness commentary. I am a fiction writer myself, so I understand how much effort you must have put into this work. As a consequence, I like to honor writer's attempts to step outside of the box, so I'll give you a ""3"" for form.  peer 6      I couldn't find grammar mistakes.      peer 1      I am sorry, but I don't understand exactly what you want to tell us with your essay; how do we understand that the narrator is insane and unreliable? You don't show us that.  peer 2      Maybe, for you, there are a shadowing idea somewhere between your words, but I'm really sorry, i couldn't find it. and there are not connections between your words. the approach of madness doesn't fit.  peer 3      I'm not sure where Poe leaves off and you begin!  peer 4      The dialogue is amusing but not necessarily convincing; the non-Poe line of thought does not fully create a line of argument that persuades this reader.  peer 5      Again, I'm not sure how to score your content because you've done something entirely different than any other writer I've read during this course. You present some very good ideas towards the end of the essay. However, the first 2/3rds of the essay feels to me like all form and no substance other than establishing that you're writing a stream of consciousness commentary. The meat of the essay begins with ""You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings."" As a result, I'm going to rate your content as a ""2.""  peer 6      It is not an essay. There's no argument or analysis on it.      peer 1      I was impressed with your essay. If we were a class of creative writing I could give you a ""3"". I can imagine you in a class telling these, I am sure that all the students will follow you with a lot of attention, may be more than others's essays. But, without a face to face presentation, your text is very confused.  peer 2      Are you trying to fool me? or fool all the fellows students? you give me the pieces but there aren't a puzzle. I tried really hard to listen the sound of your biting heart, but there are not heart. there are no sound. sorry to be your butcher, and i wash my hands.  peer 5      I really enjoyed reading your piece. It's certainly a bold move. It shows that you not only analyzed Poe's big ideas, you also paid attention to specific phrasings, etc. This type of essay fits well with a literature class.  peer 6          score: 2+1;Thanks everyone for the inspiring words. And Javier I am no more concerned about the grades. I have a couple of 3s now, mostly because of not writing the traditional essay. But I am having a wonderful time with the course but I will be experimenting with the form and narration.  ;    Martha Ellen WaggonerYour essay...Is all made of quotations from wikipedia (which is not the best   source). Also, I'm studying science and even we don't need to remember so much about fixating.

Poems have tendency to foretell future sometimes. Maybe not, I'm not knowledgeable about Poe's life;I like your essay and enjoyed reading it. I particularly like the comparison you made with Icarus, and the references to ""Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese ""version of Icarus."" If I had reviewed it,   I would have made a couple of suggestions regarding the form, specifically, just to tighten it up. For example, I think the second paragraph reiterates the first. I like the main idea you presented, but I think it would have worked better by omitting the Genesis reference and including it in your thesis. This would have left more room for analysis, as the third paragraph contained a little too much summary and not enough of your own original content with quotes from the text to support it.   I hope this helps, but overall, good job!;Aleksandar, your English is not bad. Basically, your sentence structure is fine, if a little awkward in places. Plus, there are a few instances where articles are either used when they aren't needed or are omitted, but these are minor mistakes. To save time, I'm only writing the corrections. For instance, It should read ""In ancient Greece."" Plus, by substituting a few words, this one would read better as ""This motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, which we can determine by examining the stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese versions of Icarus respectively.""   Also, this sentence is a little long, and could be simplified. ""Although their  stories of ""claiming the Sun"" are different for each character, the actual cause is the same (striving for perfection), as is the final outcome of death.  There are a couple of other places where the sentence structure is awkward like, ""When comparing the ""modern"" world with ancient cultures, we often time claim ""progress and prosperity"" in the name of  science and technology. (We sometimes believe) their advanced applications allow us to create a more developed society, one more evolved and better in all respects. From here, you could link the next paragraph with this one by starting, with, One such instance can be found in the short-story ""The Birthmark'""  As you can see, it's really a matter of cutting out unnecessary words, combining your thoughts into concise sentences when you can do so, and building your vocabulary.

Thirteen years, five or six drafts, and probably 500,000 to a million pages later, I'm just now getting to something workable, novel-wise.Needless to say, I love to read and write, and I'm looking forward to learning a lot in this course.;Go blue indeed! My grandfather once put his fist through the television during an Ohio St/U of M game - things were going badly, apparently. And my stepmother went to Ohio St... so there's a week out of the year where no one on that side of the family speaks to each other! Meanwhile, when I go back ""home"" to Grand Rapids, they call me a Georgia peach (I have, over 20 odd years, picked up a slight southern twang that is only noticeable to Midwesterners), but in Georgia, they still call me a d*** Yankee. At least I still carry a map of my home state right on my hand. :);Hi Kimberly and Jenny, I live in Lawrenceville (Gwinnett Co, near the Mall of GA). Your accent is probably very close to mine! After 24 years, fellow Midwesterners who live here still randomly say, ""Hey, you're from Michigan!"" but when I go up north, I can hear that slight southern edge to my vowels. Then, of course, there's the fact that asking for ""pop"" got me ""what?!"" down here, so I switched to calling everything Coke (orange coke, pepsi coke, etc)... so now when I go back to MI, people look at me funny and say ""We don't have Coke, you want pop?"" D'oh!I pick up accents *very* easily and unintentionally (I tend to code-switch without thinking about it), so I *should* have a full on southern accent after all these years, but as a kid, I was upset at leaving ""my lake"" (Lake Mich) and thus determined to never sound southern... but nowadays it makes me feel a little like a person without a country, lol!I keep thinking about moving back to go to college at U of M - or maybe Grand Valley State, where I spend my summers at wheelchair sports camp (first as a camper, now as a counselor/mentor) and where I have more family - but I think the weather might kill me. Snow and ice are not kind to wheelchair users!;I usually have the opposite problem; I'm too succinct and fail to reach the minimum without needing to repeat myself. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have my skill for short-form essays challenged.;I'm going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I'm finished with the book, I'll have a list to cull and expand on.This is pretty much the tack I'm going to take, too.When I was at college mmmmph (OK, over 20) years ago, I really struggled with what the expectations of lecturers were and how to go about writing effective essays. Over the years, I've discovered that for me bullet pointing makes everything alright. It's much easier for me to jot things down, connect the dots, and merge points when the ideas are separated out that way. It also took being out of education for many years to gain the confidence to just ask what is expected and how best to meet that expectation (or run like the clappers from it).  It's marvellous to have really clearly stated expectations AND a slew of resources to help us meet them. The video clips and the student essay portfolios on the wiki are immensely helpful and reassuring.  I've never taken notes *as* I read before. ... stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.I  understand how stop-start reading breaks the flow. I find it impossible to read anything first time round while taking notes. My plan is to read once for pleasure, make some bullet points about overall impressions, then read again while taking notes.;Oh, I hear you on class and academia! Though the late 60s and 70s saw a lot of university fees paid for by the state in the UK, and so a lot more working class academics were in place by the late 80s, there was still a real skew towards the culture of the public school when I was there. I just continuously assumed I was wrong or stupid or just incompetent, whereas now I know that there was a systemic failure to transition kids from ordinary state schools to universities. Some of my lecturers were really great, and one gave extra-curricular classes on writing for his course, but the overwhelming majority were, I think, blissfully unaware that any of us needed any support.I reckon a bunch of people I was at uni with got their degrees despite the obstacles, not because they got help. I dropped out due to chronic illness, but ended up hanging out with a bunch of academics later in life more by accident than anything. Most of them had undergone similar experiences, and were determined that their students wouldn't suffer the same fate. I learned enough of The Rules second-hand from them to stop beating myself up for having ""failed"". I have a whole patented rant about institutionalised dysfunctional behaviours I have observed as I watched friends go through the post-grad grinder.I need to get on to the Doctorow. He's the only author on the list I haven't read, and yet he's been recommended to me by so many people it's ridiculous. Vonnegut, you say? I'm sold.;I'm quickly skimming through the student portfolios available on the course wiki to get a flavour of the diversity in style and focus to expect - as well as to reassure myself about the process of writing for the course! I'd recommend it as an exercise in reassurance as well as building excitement :);I didn't write notes in any of the books.From memory,  a child has doodled on one of the pages of Alice in Wonderland but that just adds to the charm!Regards;Russell T Davies did wonders for Doctor Who.;RTD is certainly awesome and would go as far as to say his time on DW changed the face of SF on television.  ;Wow! That is wonderfully sweet of you, thank you so much! I may very well take you up on that, as my own explorations of my computer have yielded little in the way of useful voice features. I actually did manage to get my hands on an audio copy of le Guin's book -- about the only one so far. Thank you so much for the offer! If you can help me figure out some screen reading options for Windows XP, that would be fantastic. I tried it yesterday, but the voice only wanted to read my tool bar, not the document I was looking at. I've been thinking of looking into programs like JAWS and Dragon, but my computer is on its last legs and I'm pretty sure I don't want to buy more software for XP, only to have to upgrade to Windows 8 and reinstall everything. So right now I'm stuck with only what came with my operating system. ;All but the Le Guin are available for free on Project Gutenberg, where you can download for Kindle and read onscreen.LibriVox may have some of the audio books for free - I recall the Grimms' and Carroll's work being there.Megan, you realise you've just outed yourself as one of those people that technologically-challenged folk like me pester for information, right?Update:In this thread, there's a discussion of free audio books for the course from LibriVox:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=35  So far, people say  Carrol, Stoker, Shelly are definitely available there.;This is great stuff to be aware of and share.;I don't think there is an absolute answer to your question, Claire, but I'll give you my opinion. By Katrina's definition above, and by the one given by Prof. Rabkin, as you point out, *all* fiction is fantasy - at least, all *good* fiction should ""invite suspension of reality."" Even if a novel is a ""slice of life"" work, by its very nature, it is a fictional world, and not actual events that happened in anyone's reality - otherwise it would be a biography.As someone who writes ""slice of life,"" I've been asking myself your question since seeing the first set of videos. Is, then, what *I* write fantasy?Yes and no.Yes, in the sense that it is all a fictional (and hopefully immersive) world. One that closely resembles our own, but in which the protagonists deal with Big Things perhaps more often than average. Sometimes those things are good, sometimes they are bad. Sometimes the characters win, and sometimes not. The biggest way in which my ""universe"" differs from the real one is that the protagonists are rather better communicators than Joe Average. They are not preternaturally so in any way; rather, being good communicators is a survival skill and a cultural talent they value, so it's something they've worked to cultivate. But that's the most fantastic thing about them. Well, that and the fact that they're meant to be dead.No no, don't misunderstand, they're human. A hundred percent human. They just should be dead by *now*. No, it's not Tuck Everlasting. They're just regular people, leading regular lives... but they both have a disease which should have killed them long ago, and it hasn't. No, it's not a supernatural or special disease. It exists in this world. And they're not particularly strong, or healthy, for that matter - just lucky. Like many thousands of people who wake up every day and go about their daily lives when statistics say they should be dead. Some of the plot is about how they cope with that - most of it isn't.I have explained my ""universe"" in this way for a reason - if I did my ""job,"" did you notice how quickly you were willing to accept that there might be something fantastical going on? And yet, they are very average people with, for the most part, average lives. But part of a writer's job is to capture your attention and your imagination at the same time. To say, ""Come with me....and trust me."" If you can't get the reader to come along, your work is for naught. But once they've come along, they have to trust that you're going to lay out some rules, any rules, and abide by them.   The rules can be as mundane or ridiculous as the author likes, but they have to stay consistent within the narrative. Now that I've told you why my characters aren't dead, and emphatically explained that there is no supernatural cause, it would be cheap for me to say, ""but actually, they're secretly vampires."" I'd be breaking the rules I set out, and thus breaking the ""contract"" between myself and the reader(s). At the same time, hopefully the reader has that little niggle in the back of their mind - why are *these* people alive? Why those specific people? Is there possibly a reason that even the protagonists haven't uncovered? Or is the universe just that fickle? That is one of the spaces in which I play. I like that sandbox.So that's how all fiction *can* be fantasy - done well, it primes you to accept anything. (What would be the point of reading Sherlock if, in the back of your mind, you didn't wonder if *this time* he might miss something? You trust that in the end, he'll solve the mystery - he's Sherlock Holmes! But maybe, just maybe...)Here then is why what I write *isn't* fantasy - there's nothing otherworldly in it. By the common definition, fantasy must contain at least one *impossible* (not just unlikely) element. Harry Potter has magic. C.S. Lewis has Narnia. Naomi Novik has talking dragons fighting historical battles in the Air Force. My protagonists aren't impossible, since, as I said, they have a real disease with real consequences that real people in this world have survived for extraordinary periods, too. Not impossible, just unlikely.By the latter measure, Sherlock Holmes and other such characters (Poirot, etc) are fantasy because they belong more to the world of archetype than reality. As much as you think they *might* fail (and that's important, because without it, there is no dramatic tension), you trust that they *won't* fail. It would break the rules (and shatter your trust) to read a Great Detective story where the detective bumbles around, stomps on the evidence, blows the case, and at no point saves the day.... all because he hasn't had his coffee.That's why the latter metric is more useful to me; and probably more practical to use in the everyday world. But I do like the idea that all good fiction is fantasy in its own way, simply because a good writer can (and might) take you anywhere.;Thank you all for taking the time to respond. Megan, your illustration was the light I needed, thank you. I feel more comfortable going forward now. I will enjoy relating the stories in the reading list to this new thought about the 'limits' of fantasy. I will have to look out for your stories as well. I write only fact and read only fiction :)   ;Interesting point Megan. I had read, among the many things said about 50 shades, that it began life as vampire fiction.  When it comes to using genre as a selling point it is tricky subject. When people look for books they start with genre, how will your book be found? Even factual books can be difficult to categorize. Unfortunately difficult to categorize books don't sell well.  ;Megan,That is good advice for peer reviewers. I never said, though, that I wanted the process to change, and I already gave an example of another class that does not have to go to this extreme. I am not telling the professor how to run his class, as everyone seems to think. I simply stated that I was confused and if the grading is a specific way, I would not fully participate. That is my choice. I understand everything that's been said, but this goes against what I stand for as a student and as a teacher. I am still excited to learn from the professor and the peers, just not through the writing assignments.  ;My concern would have been that you dropped out without giving it a fair chance, Katrina.   Don't leave before we get to play with you!   ;Megan - I 100% agree with you in re: Irish folk tales. I would argue that they are more complete. Characters are complex, have struggles to overcome (or fail to overcome....). The story arcs are complete. There is a sense of realistic consequences to actions....;Anahita, it's an interesting topic you've started. It's a question I've been asking to myself for a long time, as fairy-tales are the only literature from my childhood that I can read again and again and it doesn't matter if I know the plot already or not. I think one of the reasons is their simplicity. You don't have to make your brain sweat to understand what's written there and then, as they lack lots of details, there is room for your own imagination and it's definitely pleasant to build up all these castles, forests, wicked witches and princesses in your mind.;Theres a lot of fantasy and Sci fi to enjoy, The Power Rangers were one of my favorites and Lightspeed and TimeForce are still good if you are into them.Animated Fantasy and Sci Fi besides anime that are good today:Adventure Time just some boschian random sh*t happening all the timeBen 10 it is a great concept well executed in the first seasonTeen Titans (not the new one) and Young Justice if you like DC comicsAvengers Earth Mightiest Heroes if you like Marvelsome years ago some french cartoons boomed and quality tv rised with good shows like Totally Spies and Code LyokoAnime:Shiki contemporary rural town gets vampedAnything Gundam, specially 00 or the originalCode GeassGuilty CrownIRL Sci fi and fantasy are sort of harder to get but Stargate and Game of Thrones are still airing, and of course Battlestar Galactica reason enough to own a netflix account and watch and rewatch it till time ends.;"

The University of Arizona has one of the best and most active collegiate wheelchair basketball teams in the country, actually, so a lot of my friends went there. I had family out there at one point, but I was young and dumb and in my ""being disabled shouldn't have a bearing on where I go to school"" phase, so I never took advantage. U of AZ and University of Illinois are on my shortlist now that I know better. (In a nutshell, whether one intends to play sports or not, any college that has thriving wheelchair sports teams attracts disabled students in greater than average numbers, which results in an accessible campus and a staff that is disability-aware, which means disabled students can focus on what we're there to do - attend class!)Melissa, I'll forgive you. ;) As I said, my stepmother is an Ohio State grad and an otherwise good person, and one of my best friends from high school got his vocal performance/music degrees from there and had great things to say. So I just hate Ohio State in the abstract.... and on game days. :);I just reinstalled thunder on this computer and discovered that the default voice has been changed to Microsoft's Alice (US English). Not a big deal, though Alice sounds a bit clipped unless you slow her down! Also, if you choose to give thunder a go, a little tip - when it first starts, go to settings and adjust things to your liking. Then, go to Run, and choose ""Webbie."" It's a stripped down, high contrast version of Internet  Explorer  with a built in magnifier and other features you might find handy, and from that browser, it will automatically read entire webpages for you (Thunder also reads anything you're doing in any other program, which is what makes it better than Windows Narrator.)The easiest way for *me* to use  Webbie is to start by using the ""web"" button on the webbie browser (which shows web pages as they appear on a normal browser, with Flash etc included) and then click the ""text"" button once I get where I'm going, which then strips out all the coding and reads all of the text aloud. There are other ways to use webbie - it is entirely possible to navigate solely from the text screen. I've just never fully broken myself of using a mouse!I just tested it out with all my open tabs to make sure it still works as well as the previous version I was using, and it successfully read everything from the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland in the link provided by Prof. Rabkin, to these discussion boards, to a Reddit thread, to a Guardian news article, to another forum with some really wonky discussion board coding, to this very post I'm typing, both letter by letter and word by word ... all with no trouble.It is far from perfect, mind you, but it's a good substitute for the shinier programs like JAWS when you don't have the money to splash out on them.That should get you started if you are interested in Thunder, and the help files included are good - but of course, if you need any further help, I'm happy to assist.;Rebecca - I know that the Germanic Revival movement came before Hitler :) What I'm saying is that the form of nationalism was different, and over the years the folklore was shoehorned into a very different form of nationalism than the Irish. And in the inter-war period as the Irish Republic was forming, and then after WW2, as Germany really struggled with concepts of national identity without falling into nationalism and veered the hell away from folk traditions, the experiences of the Irish in the Republic and Northern Ireland were totally different.  It'd be foolish to imagine that it's the explanation, which isn't what I suggested; but there's something in there, I reckon :)Megan - The storytellers in my Irish family do the same :) Sadly, there was an estrangement between the English and Irish sides - the Irish side being local bigwigs did not approve of marrying into a long line of peasants - so we're only now getting to know each other. And even family stories seem to shift all over the place!Again, is that a difference in culture between German and Irish people that pre-dates the folk revivals, or is it that the Irish were not politically constrained in how they approached the stories? In fact, has the use of folklore in the Irish struggle against British rule actively encouraged a fluid telling to make it appropriate to the moment in time?Like I say, I'm not proposing that I have the answer, just possibly part of an answer.;I had no idea about the board games. Non-violent gaming - actually, non-violent anything in terms of entertainment - is hard to come by, what with the ""myth of redemptive violence"" being so pervasive. WW2 was probably a just as huge a reinforcement of that idea in the UK as it was an incentive to move towards non-violent entertainment in Germany.That was really, really interesting stuff. Thanks :);Oh. My. Word.  This was someone actually paid to teach? And your textbooks actually said that stuff?  My gast has been officially flabbered.Mind you, as a teacher once told me, ""What people BELIEVE about the past is more important than what DID happen."" And an anthropologist friend told me that, ""Changing people's beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell.""  ;To be clear, the ""what people believe"" thing was about recognising the gap between facts and evidence on the one hand and the mythologising of history on the other, and how the emotional resonance of a mythologised past actually go on to create our cultural and political reactions in the future. He was a grand teacher :)I lived in NJ for a good few years, and Other Half's of Irish descent, so I remember the culture shock of St Paddy's. A bit different than the version we get in Manchester, which is itself rather different than in various bits of Ireland... I did have several occasions when Irish-Americans gave me grief about being English, before we established that my Irish ancestry was more recent than theirs. But being Irish or Italian or Greek or any other hyphenated American is obviously going to be quite different than it is in ""the old country"". My attitude was, at first, pretty dismissive. I arrogantly assumed people were claiming an identity they'd no right to. Surely they were Americans, and that was that? I hadn't realised then that identities are complicated things. It took a few humiliating experiences to discover that a lot of my assumptions didn't hold water.That said,  I've never got over the idea of green beer, and I don't think I ever will. Some things are bred in the bone!Your mention of the textbooks reminds me of James Loewen's Lies My Teacher Told Me, which really made me question what unfacts MY teachers had passed on to me.;I enjoy the new shows as much as the old ones.   I especially think the newer ""villains"" are much better.   The Weeping Angels are great and the Silence are pretty good.   One note on the old shows is that the BBC destroyed their copies of many early episodes in the 60's and 70's.   As a result some episodes survive only in audio form.   What a shame!;And for those interested, the results of that project are now available online here: http://www.loc.gov/collection/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/;Yes, the assignment page will count the words and tell you how many you have. In addition to that, the submit button won't be clickable if you go too far over the limit! The thesis is counted in your word limit. (Your thesis also does not have to be the first sentence in your essay, just somewhere in the first paragraph. A good thesis should be recognizable as a thesis no matter where it is.) The references in your works cited are not counted in your word limit - citations go in a separate box that usually doesn't have a word limit at all.Contractions are frowned on in academic papers, but since Coursera is peer graded, nothing is ""not allowed"" on its platform. It is up to our peers to grade appropriately, and I doubt anyone would remove points for contractions. (I have never had anyone in my other Coursera classes remove points for contractions, anyway.)Word counts are a common metric in American academia, especially after the advent of the typewriter/computer. It is a way to ensure that students do not abuse the guidelines for, say, a five page assignment, by putting too many spaces between their paragraphs!;Katarzyna, yes, that's right. You *could* put ""Thesis: Text"" at the top, if you really wanted to, but generally a thesis statement is a concise statement *within* the early part of your essay that tells the reader exactly what you'll be exploring, such as, ""In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers."" If the rest of your essay is about the various ways the tales use stepmothers to warn against jealousy, that would be a good thesis statement, and the reader would be able to pick that out as your thesis, without you having to put ""Thesis: In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers,"" at the top.In fact, a good way to check if your thesis is strong enough is to write your essay and then read it back to yourself and see if all the other statements relate back to your thesis. If they do, then any other reader will be able to figure out your thesis, too.Happy to help. :);Anonymous, the Coursera word counter has frustrated me many a time, and I still haven't quite worked out exactly what counts as one word or two by its metrics! I think you may be right about apostrophes causing words to be counted as two regardless of whether they're used in a contraction or the possessive. It seems like there are one or two other oddities about it, but I haven't figured them out yet.Hyphenated words definitely count as two words. Citations within the text - e.g. (Grimm) or [1] - sometimes count as words, sometimes not. (In previous classes, I could sometimes eke out room for another word by deleting the space between the phrase and the citation... and sometimes that didn't work.) All I can say is, I am eternally grateful for that buffer (usually between 30-100 words) between the ""official"" essay limit and the point where the submission button greys out. I'd never get anything submitted, otherwise!;Anonymous, I am irritated by any word count limit under 2000! I have figured out, though, that the main reason Coursera professors tend to set low limits is because it is our peers who are doing the grading, and they are each expected to evaluate multiple essays. If everyone in the class writes as extensively as I would like to, that is a lot of reading for a peer to do, especially if their written English skills are not good due to a language barrier or a learning disability, or they have difficulty with their sight. (We have students with each of those challenges in this class with us at the moment.)   A student who is mentally or physically fatigued by reading in their non-native language, or by reading print of any kind, will fail to read *carefully* after a little while, and that would unfairly affect the grades of those of us who would like to go on at greater length.Even though I hate it, I am warming to the challenge of trying to express my ideas in such few words. As Prof. Rabkin says, it is helping me crystallize my thoughts.;Emily, I'm just a fellow student, but I thought Prof. Rabkin covered things pretty well in his ""How to Write for this Course"" lecture. If you haven't seen that yet, go check it out, it may help you get to grips with his intentions direct from the horse's mouth.This course, to me, does not appear to be markedly different from even the most basic literature course. Don't let the ""level"" spook you; I would venture to guess you probably *have* done this before, even if you've never written an essay on it - most of us interpret literature without thinking about it. (Dr. Rabkin says this in the videos, too.) Consider ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" It's not just about a literal rabbit and a literal tortoise, is it? The merits of perseverance, the perils of laziness/cockiness, the importance of not counting one's chickens before they hatch, the dangers of being a braggart, the importance of hard work and practice, pride goeth before a fall... all of those themes are potentially in that story. And all of them would make a decent essay. You can probably think of more.Unlike scientific writing, there is no absolute structure involved in a literature essay, because there are no (or at least, few) absolute facts, since literature can be interpreted in many different ways. Prof. Rabkin covered this in the videos, so you can check my breakdown against his instructions if you like, but this is the general summary of how a literature essay works.Pick an idea that says something about the text on a deeper level than what the literal story is. This can be a general theme you've noticed, or it can be found by paying attention to specific words to uncover a ""hidden"" theme, as Prof. Rabkin demonstrates.Develop this idea into a sentence or two that encompasses what you would like to talk about. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil."" becomes ""The evil stepmother symbolizes the importance of the family unit and the fear of outside influences destabilizing family harmony."")This sentence becomes your thesis. Check through the story(-ies) you are analyzing and make sure that your thesis is supportable. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil because remarriage is a bad idea"" would be a bad thesis. It says nothing about the deeper meaning of the story, and you can't support that thesis with the story text.)If your thesis checks out, write your essay around it. Write sentences that support that thesis statement and examine it in greater detail. When you're finished, read over your essay and make sure that every other sentence in it relates back to your thesis (the thesis itself does not have to be labeled ""thesis"" and can be anywhere near the beginning of your essay. If you have supported your thesis well enough and made sure every statement relates back to it, the reader should be able to spot it without explicit directions).That is as close to a ""formula"" or a ""structure"" as any instructions for a literature essay are ever going to come, I'm afraid. I'm much better at scientific papers than lit papers myself, so I understand your desire for greater structure and clearer instructions, but the reason there aren't any more than what Prof. Rabkin has already given us is because literature is about personal interpretation, and personal interpretation varies as much as people do.;I too am struggling with this - I have one ""outside connection"" in my essay as it stands right now. I will probably leave it in, as it has to do with the time period in which the stories were told, which I think is necessary to make my particular argument complete. I think it's easier to avoid any outside connections with a longer work.... for example, when I wrote a paper on mythology in Fahrenheit 451, there were enough various mythology references for me to deal with in the text itself so as to make expository information about mythology unnecessary. With Grimm, because the stories are so short, one's choice of thesis might easily require a tiny bit of outside contextual reference.I could, of course, just choose a different thesis, and I still might.... but I really like the one I've got.;""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you..."" ;I think about that every time I run a search for something dodgy. Makes me wish there was something standardized that writers could put on our computers along the lines of ""it's just for a novel, I promise!"";Karen, I've seen it, and given what the NSA is doing on US soil these days (though not, it must be said, solely to Americans!) we should all *hope* it's useless!Elise, thanks for my first laugh of the morning! But yes, something *exactly* like that. :);These are all great interpretations! I think there is also something to be said for this story being a ""do not defy the natural order of things"" type of story. Cats and mice are considered to be ""mortal enemies,"" and the cat could not overcome his true nature as a predator. This would have been an important lesson to teach children in the time period in which these stories were told, when the class system was strong and behaving or associating ""above one's station"" was frowned on.It is a theme to some extent echoed in Orwell's Animal Farm - the animals seek to build a utopian society they never could have had with the humans around, only to find themselves echoing the very worst aspects of human nature. In the end, the animals are worse off than where they began. Of course, Orwell was sending a much more complex and ultimately different message than is in the Grimm story - but the message of ""disrupting the natural order of things can have unpleasant consequences"" is the same.;I'm sure it's fine from an academic integrity standpoint (as others have mentioned, previous students in the course have already done so). I would personally be wary of posting a complete draft of an essay on a publicly accessible website *before* the peer review deadline for that essay, though - even if it's just a draft. Not because it violates any academic integrity standards, but because, sad to say, in a course this large, there will always be a few unsavory or desperate individuals who are tempted to plagiarize. The number of individuals tempted to do this tends to drop as the course progresses (because those people drop out).But for myself, I would hate to post a draft of my essay and then have a peer reviewer see two (or more!) copies of that essay and mark me down for potential plagiarism. Since peer reviews are done anonymously on both sides, the reviewer has no way of knowing that the person who wrote one *particular* essay is the same one who posted it online in the first place. This happened in one of my previous courses - a student copied an essay she had authored herself and previously posted online, others found the same essay and copied it too, and the whole lot of them ended up with zeros for plagiarism, because we had no way of proving who the original author was.So, were it me, I would stick to blogging general impressions/reviews of the book and your essay topic, but avoid quoting from that essay or posting any drafts of it until *after* the peer review period. Unless doing so would completely break your blog format, this could even become an ""eagerly awaited"" feature of your blog - as soon as grading closes, your readers get to see the final product!;Remember, though, that The Six Soldiers of Fortune begins with the line, ""There was once a man who was a Jack-of-all-trades; he had served in the war, and had been brave and bold, but at the end of it he was sent about his business, with three farthings and his discharge."" In other words, the soldier is seeking revenge for having been wronged - not looting and pillaging for no particular purpose. In that sense, the Six Soldiers of Fortune might be showing not the *reverse* of Faithful John, but the same general moral - if you serve faithfully, you are entitled to reward.;Oh, absolutely, there are plenty of morally questionable things in the Six Soldiers. For that matter, cutting off the heads of one's children (as in Faithful John) is pretty morally questionable! One of the things I'm coming to appreciate about Grimm's tales is that the more you look at them, the more meanings and interpretations float to the surface.;I was raised in the oral story tradition, where one of the greatest compliments one can get is to be asked to tell a certain rendition again, but repeating a story is considered not possible, because the story varies depending on the audience, the mood, and the very night it is told. As you point out, you can tell the same *general* story, but never the same *exact* story.At the same time though, writing is, I think, beginning to share certain things with the oral tradition that have only been possible since the advent of the internet. It's true that once a story is written, it's less mutable than an oral tale. Consider, though, published books vs. the massive online community devoted to fanfiction about those books. Fanfiction has, in a way, existed for as long as the written word (the temptation to tell a familiar story in one's own way is, I think, universal), but only now can the people who want to ""play"" in an author's world find each other, tell their own stories, find their own stories shaped by others who are playing (sometimes in real time), and so on.Similarly, I've been working on a novel for over a decade now, and I had far too much material to wade through and a difficult time sorting the wheat from the chaff. So I went to a fellow writer and friend of mine, and said, ""I need to play with these characters a bit. You've read some drafts and you know what I do - can you knock together a character and we'll throw them together and just see what happens?""So we did, bouncing dialogue and scenes off each other over various instant messaging programs. Sometimes line by line, sometimes a page or two at a time. I've sorted out my characters now, but my friend and I still play this way a few times a week, just for fun - and although we do copy everything over to a document at the end of the night, and we build on what's come before, the *feel* of what we do is far closer to oral storytelling than writing. Writing is solitary - storytelling is interactive. Writing is considered - storytelling is immediate, improvised, adjusted on the fly. Neither can be replaced by the other; what my friend and I do together, fun as it is, isn't really publishable. We do it for the experience of it all (just like with storytelling). What I do on my own is harder, but it's a better *read*. And I never would have had the experience of written, interactive storytelling without the internet. So, I think the lines between oral storytelling and written stories are beginning to blur.... and for me, that's a fantastic, delightful ride. ;Leonardo, indeed! No matter how much preparation you do as the Dungeon Master, the players will always push you in directions you didn't anticipate, and usually discover entirely new, unplanned stories by doing so.;As someone else who is unemployed and time rich but cash poor, I second the library suggestion. I bought the two books in question used off amazon, but only because this happens to be the only time of year that I have a little bit of money in my ""used books"" fund! If the library is not possible due to lack of transportation (lack of bus fare/gas money/etc), I will simply say this: The internet has everything under the sun, if you look hard enough.(Edited to add: As a writer myself, I hope everyone in this class finds legal means of accessing the material - piracy devalues my own personal craft, and I don't endorse it. As a person of severely limited financial means, though, I know that's not always realistically possible, and since this thread is about accessing the material for *study*, it puts things in a slightly different light. Crystal, I hope you do have the means to get to the library or a nice cozy book shop. If, though, getting transportation to a place like that is a pipe dream because you're struggling just to keep the lights on.... the internet is a vast place.);The syllabus, located here: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseSyllabussays, ""the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886)  which was published by Dover and is available online through Project  Gutenberg.""In other words, if you are using the Lucy Crane translation, you are supposed to read all of those stories. Hope that helps.;When my mother found out she was pregnant with me, the first thing she did was buy dozens of children's books, so I was being read to all the way back in utero. :) When I was two, my mother ended up on total bedrest during her pregnancy with my sister. I could just barely crawl by this time (I have cerebral palsy), so mom was trying to deal with a curious, but nearly immobile, two year old while dad was at work. She figured she might as well teach me to read. I remember loving the process of learning, but hating the circumstances... it was a hot, sweaty Michigan summer with no air conditioning and few fans, with the temperature often exceeding 90F/32C during the day. I wanted to go to Lake Michigan (a 15 minute drive from our home) and cool off, not practice my phonics! I persevered and was reading fluently when my sister was born, just in time for my third birthday.I haven't stopped since. Thanks, Mom.;Karen, first of all, I promise I'm not stalking you! :)But as one who'd also read anything, your last comment reminded me of when I was about six and went through a period of wanting to read a lot of comic books. Not solely comics, mind you. And not ""standard"" comics. I had happened upon comic book adaptations of O. Henry, Dickens, Jack London, Mary Shelley, Mark Twain - classics. And I loved them. But mom was concerned that such a steady diet of comics might be... I don't know. Too low-brow? Rotting my brain? I was her eldest child, so she worried about such things! She went to my teacher, who asked to see what I was reading. When I handed them over, he laughed and told my mother, ""First of all, she's reading comic adaptations of some of the greatest literature ever written - it's hardly all POW and BAM. Secondly, I'm just glad she's *reading*. Let her read the back of the cereal box, who cares?""Mom relaxed a little after that. I still have all those comics... they're still brilliant.;I owe a lot of my adult reading philosophies to my mother, in good ways and bad... I still worry about reading things that are ""low-brow"" (I hid the Harry Potter books for *ages*, until it became socially acceptable for adults to read them!) and my mother will still scoff if she finds ""trash"" on the Kindle (it's technically my Kindle, but I gave it to her so she could read between her school bus routes, since I can access the account from my computer. It's a fine arrangement, as we like to read a lot of the same things - but it does mean I hesitate before acquiring anything I might hear about later!).I too was easily scared as a child (still can't watch horror films), but my mother took the opposite approach - the day I got my library card, she handed over a note to the librarian that said I wasn't to be barred from any part of the library and I wasn't to have any of my selections questioned under any circumstances. The librarian looked at her a bit askance (I was 4, iirc) but agreed to keep it on file. I asked mom why she would bother with such a note, since, at four, I had little desire to venture too far beyond the children's section.She told me that when she was nine, she had tried to check To Kill a Mockingbird out of the very same library, and had been barred from doing so by the head librarian (this being just after it was published, when such a novel was considered to be *highly* subversive). She went home and told her father, who marched up to the library and demanded to know exactly why his daughter was being barred from reading *anything*, because an educated populace was something to celebrate, and surely she wasn't questioning his ability to parent by making decisions about his child's education for him, etc etc. (My grandfather on my mother's side is probably from whence my more revolutionary side comes!) The librarian handed the book over, and my grandfather told my mother, ""I can't give you half what I'd like to... but I'll be damned if I'll ever let anyone tell you what you can *read*. There are some difficult things in this book, and some of them you might not be ready for. You don't have to read them if you don't want to. If you do read them, come to me if you need to talk about them."" He died a few years later. When he did, mom realized that the greatest gift he'd ever given her was the notion that no book is ""bad,"" because books are meant to foster discussion. She vowed to raise her kids the same way.In the main, she succeeded. My greatest worry as a kid (and now!) regarding my reading material is that she'll comment that a book is ""beneath (my) capabilities""... but she never told me not to read anything, or that I ""shouldn't"" read anything. She just prefers I spend my time reading books that make me think.... which does not at all exclude popular modern novels. We both read everything from King to biographies to mystery novels to Plato - I introduced her to the Temeraire series and Harry Potter, she introduced me to Stieg Larsson. Our conversations often begin, ""You *have* to read this!!!""It's not a watertight philosophy, mind you, as she found out when I was about nine and came to her with a Judy Blume book in my hand. ""Mom, the main character keeps talking about something going up. What's he talking about?""To her credit, her reply was, ""Hang on just a minute. I need a cigarette for this conversation!""There were plenty of times I accidentally scared myself silly (John Bellairs ""The Eyes of the Killer Robot"" was the source of not a few nightmares), but my parents were smart enough to turn even those into literary discussions - why is having your eyes taken scary? Why eyes, in particular? It must be said that my father was in no way on board with the ""read anything you like"" plan. He liked his sleep!;Kathleen, that's an interesting question!What inspired me to keep reading... I think part of it was a love of word play. Both of my parents love word play, puns, double entendres, and words that are just plain fun to say, so I was raised with a lot of that. Instead of saying ""Time for dinner,"" my father would announce, ""Time to masticate some comestibles,"" and I had no idea that wasn't how everyone announced a meal was ready until I was well into primary school. :) Some of it was undoubtedly because I was shy (books were friends without that complicated making friends bit), and some of it was because with books, I could go anywhere, regardless of how laid up I might be in real life (four full summers in leg casts from hips to toes). I'm positive some of my ""read everything I can get my hands on immediately if not sooner"" philosophy came out of those miserable summers. I might not have survived with my sanity intact without the library!Having said all that, my sister grew up in the exact same environment - leg casts included, though not as many times - and couldn't possibly care less about books. She's a visual learner and a pictorial thinker (she was stunned to learn I think in *words,* and now thinks anyone who does is *irredeemably* strange) so while she enjoys being read *to* for short periods, she'd really rather watch a video or draw a picture. We're both well into adulthood now, but the pattern was evident from the time we were very small.;I can't decide if the notion of having two of my father in the world would be a good or a bad thing - not sure the planet could handle it!Ah, brain fog. It's slowed my reading significantly, too. First inkling I had that something might be wrong was at uni, when I found myself reading the same page over and over and understanding *nothing*... it felt like I was trying to read a language in which I knew all the words but had no idea how they went together. Turned out to be RA, so now I get brain fog from the RA *and* from the meds used to keep my joints from eating themselves! Reading on a high contrast monitor helps.... sometimes.My sister has autism and a lot of learning difficulties, and finds reading easier if she uses a yellow overlay. On the rare occasions she picks up a book, we can tell she's actually been reading it because it's got a sheet of yellow plastic stuck in.;I am just a fellow student, so my answer is not in any way official. Here is my opinion.Generally, personal feelings are not put into a literature essay. Personal *thoughts* are, that is, your personal view of what the text is trying to say. But not personal feelings, like ""I think these tales are scary,"" or ""these tales scared me as a child.""However, you can discuss your feelings indirectly, by saying something like ""Grimm's tales instill fear in children by dealing with topics such as death, loss, abuse,"" and so on. One of the hardest things for me about writing literary essays is sounding declarative, instead of as though I am only offering my opinion!That said, if I were peer reviewing an essay with personal content in it, I would probably not take points off as long as the personal content related to the thesis statement. It is probably worth asking yoursel"
False,St12,Coh1,0.42857142857142855,0,1,1.0,0.0334979,1.0,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.36723165,0.0,"Sean, on the whole, I completely agree. I have never been heavily into fantasy or sci-fi, but only because I'm a very eclectic reader who will read anything put in front of me (so I'm not really ""heavily"" into *anything*); when I do, though, I am usually impressed and gratified by what I find.It's funny, you're not the first person on this thread who's mentioned that we don't necessarily have to share attributes to relate to the characters or appreciate the story (including appreciating the time period in which it was written and/or set, whether we are comfortable with it or not). I agree with that, too. Lest that be a confusing statement coming from me after all the pontification above, I'll unpack it a little (n.b.: None of this is directed at any one person in particular, just some general observations on my part): I think often when these conversations arise, people who have rarely been bothered by representation in literature have a difficult time understanding the perspective of those who *are* bothered. There's a mistaken impression that we're incapable of enjoying anything that ever hits a misstep, and/or that we go *looking* for things to rant about.Nothing could be further from the truth. If you talk to people who like to discuss problematic representation (or total lack of representation) in the media, or who like to deconstruct attitudes in literature over time, we are usually the most ardent defenders of preserving historical texts as written, and of books/shows we love dearly even when they *are* problematic. Generally, it's the people who try to speak *for* us who want book burnings, whitewashing of texts, and refuse to read/watch/discuss anything that doesn't portray everyone in society as absolutely equal. I think the sanitization of literature is a crime, quite frankly. I read *to feel things*. I would much rather read a good book with some problematic content that upsets me, than read one that the political correctness police have had a go at. It's just that sometimes I get smacked with a prejudice that I wasn't in a good mental place to handle... but that doesn't mean I don't recognize the right of that art to exist. As a corollary to that, I know few people who read *only* fiction involving social minorities. I tend not to associate with those people, because their narrow view of the world doesn't suit me. :) Some of my favorite books in the world have no minorities in them whatsoever; I find other ways in which to identify with them. We are all more than the sum of our parts, and at the end of the day, we're all human.   Good writing trancends all identity labels. Also, as a writer I believe that writing exists to speak truth. Ugly truths are not excepted. Fiction is the mirror humanity holds up to itself, but that mirror is  only engaging and useful if it reflects *some* kind of truth. As a matter of fact, ugly truths are probably the most important ones to address.... almost always, when I find myself having an issue with a *modern* novel/tv show/film, it's because it's addressed an ugly truth *badly*. Most of the time I can find my way to giving an A for effort. Some days, not so much; it's more to do with my own mental state at the time than the actual words. As an example, since you reference Doctor Who (one of three television shows that I have ever watched *religiously*): Recently, I found myself *adoring* The Crimson Horror episode, after years of bitterly complaining about Moffat's showrunning and tinny, problematic scripts. For the first time since The Doctor's Wife, I felt like it was ""my show"" again. By the very end, I was watching through my fingers - not because I was scared, but because I was waiting for Gatiss to ruin the episode for me by giving in to one of the oldest tropes in the book (if you've seen it, you know what I mean... the long, slow closeup on the alien element at the end)... and then he subverted it, with relish. I punched the air in delight.... and trepidation. Waiting for *another* of the oldest tropes in the book... And then he subverted *that*, too. Honest to God, I teared up. There were so many ways that episode could have gone wrong from the perspective of portraying a disabled character, and Gatiss sidestepped them all. Or so I thought. Then I began reading over other people's impressions, and realized I'd completely missed all the instances of ""male gaze"" in the episode (Moffat just can't help himself!) Didn't ruin it a bit for me. (Spoilers!) Sure, it's problematic that The Doctor would grab a woman (and a woman whom he knows is a lesbian) for a very inappropriate kiss. On rewatch, it bothers me a little, simply because it's so unnecessary (likewise the sonic screwdriver gag in the same scene), and it's a cheap laugh that could've been got another, better way.... as played, it feels *grabby* and *intrusive*. (Men often get this wrong, because it plays well in fiction for men to be aggressive and grabby with women, sexual orientation irrelevant. Trouble is, most women have had experiences like that in *real life*, and in real life, being suddenly, nonconsensually grabbed by a man - even a man you know and trust - is scary as hell.) In isolation, the scene is light and maybe amusing, but when you stack it against the other creepy behavior toward women Moffat endorses, it's just ew... especially as Doctor Who is a family show, so there are small children, particularly small boys, who are seeing this and thinking that's how a ""real man"" behaves around women/gets the girl. Like it or not, TV is the biggest shaper of culture, and while no one message will affect a kid, boys get *bombarded* with those messages.... Be aggressive. Grabbing a woman is okay if you're ""just joking."" Grabbing a woman is okay if she doesn't scream or smack you. Women secretly want to be ordered around, dragged around or thrown around, because it's sexy and proves you are masculine. No means yes. If you didn't mean to hurt her/scare her, then she has no right to be upset. Good intentions are enough. The aware guys of the world, which I do think is most of them, quickly come to understand that these messages are bull. But it's a lot of baggage to lay on them and then say, ""Now, don't *ever* act like everyone you see on TV."" It's setting boys (who will one day be men) up to fail, I think, and that's no more fair to the boys than to the girls (who get the opposite damaging messages: Be passive. Don't hurt anyone's feelings. If he didn't mean it, then you're oversensitive to be bothered by it. You have little to no right to your own personal space, especially if the person encroaching on that space is male.) It's little wonder that men and women have such difficulty communicating; we're not from different planets, we just get messages from society that set us up to not communicate!Anyway, to return to The Crimson Horror (spoilers, again): I read a little further in the discussion threads and found, on a feminist blog that claims to celebrate intersectionality (that is, be sensitive to the fact that there are many different types of minorities in the world, and we won't always have the same feelings/needs), the following bit of a post, paraphrased: ""I don't understand why The Doctor didn't just cure Ada at the end of the episode. Surely he has the technology. His cruelness in leaving her blind was shocking. She'll never amount to anything trying to function like that in Victorian society. She saved him and that's how he repays her?"" I still haven't responded to that comment, and I probably won't. Besides demonstrating that just because one is a social minority, it doesn't make one immune to saying incredibly hurtful and ignorant things, it hammered home the idea that we have a long way to go - intersectionality is a great buzz word, but right now, it's still mostly a buzz word. Trying to explain the problems with that comment to a non-disabled person is often quite literally like trying to describe colors to a person who has never been able to see, and weeks later, I'm still not up for trying to explain to that (I'm sure, very well-meaning) person exactly why her comment is deeply offensive, and then, no doubt, end up in a poo-flinging match about why it's okay for a *blind* person to say something like that, but not a sighted person. (Why? Because life's not fair, that's why. Just like I can and do call myself a cripple and a gimp, but if an ablebodied person does so, they are quite likely to find their ankles clipped by my front casters.)As usual, I digress. You are entirely correct that fantasy and sci-fi often get it right more than they get it wrong, and also that portrayal of minorities (or two-hearted Time Lords!) should never sacrifice story just to make a point about diversity.   When writers do that, they come across as lecturing, and it's not pretty. I actually don't find it hard to avoid minority issues eating the plot at *all*, but then, I've been doing it all my life. I'm sure it's harder for people who are less aware of minority points of view. Really, though, no one expects everyone to know everything - we can each only write from our own experiences and interests - but avoiding being preachy or worse, desperately wrong/offensive is easily solved by simply *asking* someone of the minority you're trying to portray - preferably *before* your writing is finalized!I am deeply ambivalent about Flowers for Algernon. It's an important book, no doubt, and a good one, and I'm glad it's out there. I still have my copy. But I have to be in the right mood to read it, because as with a lot of fiction that tries to tackle disability but is written by a non-disabled author, the ""got it just right"" bits are a thrill and the missteps are glaring. (My sister functions at a level similar to Charlie's ""natural"" state, so she and I have had many discussions about it.);Funny you should mention that. I was going to bring up the whole ""besides, the Doctor is asexual!"" thing, but I never know how people will react! Ten is ""my Doctor,"" but even speaking from that perspective, I found his relationship with Rose... I don't know. Strange? Out of character? Inexplicable? None of which was anything to do with *Rose*, whom I liked on the whole. It just seemed bizarre to me that a man as old as the Doctor, who has experienced things many orders of magnitude beyond what any human could ever experience (even human assistants/companions), would fall in love with a human in the *way* that he was depicted to have done with Rose. RTD's explanation for it is rather brilliant, though, I admit... he says that due to the circumstances surrounding the regeneration, the Doctor sort of *imprinted* on Rose, like a chick from an egg (thus the similar accents!) I still don't *like* it, but that makes the whole Ten/Rose thing make more sense to me (imo, Nine/Rose was a lot more one-sided... Ten/Rose was when the Doctor started to reciprocate in a more-than-platonic way.) Of course, Moffat then took the imprinting idea to openly creepy territory, but that's a whole other rant.I think the next Doctor will be male, too. I'm okay with that. Actually, I'm hoping and praying we'll get Ben Daniels. He's not an extra young fella, but he's easily passed for a mid-30s ""look"" in other recent shows he's done. Don't even get me started on River.... *so* much potential at introduction, and then it's all flushed down the bog! River is a perfect example of how all of Moffat's female characters have their agency ripped away from them in favor of their entire lives revolving around the Doctor. He did it with Reinette, then Sally Sparrow, then River, then Amy, now Clara. Every one of them ends up trapped in a timey-wimey situation where their actions are predestined. The first few times, it was an interesting idea. At this point, I just roll my eyes. Another woman, another cookie-cutter ""feisty girl"" who lives solely to serve The Doctor and his ends.Doctor Who is never off topic, to my mind... certainly not in a class like this!;Faith, that's a good point. Part of the reason Ten is ""my"" Doctor, even though I've seen them all, is because I find Ten's emotional range so fascinating... I know some people think Tennant chewed the scenery, but I loved that he could go from cheeky to despondent to having a geeky moment to coldly furious all in the same episode. From that point of view, it does make sense that a Doctor who feels things so deeply would also fall in love.... and since Rose was the catalyst for that regeneration (in crude terms, the woman who ""taught him how to feel again,"") it also makes sense that he would fall in love with her. Thanks for that.A lot (not all, but I'd say 50% or so) of the ""but the Doctor is asexual!"" comments I see do in fact come *from* asexual fans, who aren't so much upset with Who as they are crying out for representation; they feel like putting the Doctor in the ""sexual"" box has just ripped away one of the characters they can most relate to. (Moffat's snarky comments about asexuality being ""boring"" don't help on that front.) As one who identified as asexual for many years (cause I sure as hell wasn't a straight woman, and I wasn't a lesbian, and I didn't know what that left other than asexual, because *nobody*, including me, was going to touch me *anywhere* if I could help it - gender dysphoria is a barrel of fun, especially when you have no idea what it is!), I can sympathize with their point.I like Clara and River too, they both just make me so *sad* with what Moffat's done to them... River had bucketloads of personality (love her or hate her, no one's ambivalent!) and then it turned out none of that *personality* even belonged to her, let alone the events of her life... and poor Clara was written from the start as a plot device, a tabula rosa to fulfill Moffat's ""brilliant"" storyline. It's such a shame.I'm in favor of such a class; as long as we're not unraveling the base code of the universe, which was the first thought that came to mind when you said that! :);Moffat has been a festering turd re: bisexuality, too. He said that River is bisexual on his Twitter, and a fan commented along the lines of ""er, how were we supposed to know that, exactly?"" and he went off on this rant about how it wasn't his responsibility to include diverse characters (except for the LOLs), and besides, bisexual people were probably too busy shagging to watch Who anyway, so anyone that's bothered should shut up. The whole brouhaha made me glad that, while Moffat may have been the one to ""invent"" Jack, RTD was the one *shaping* Jack's character... because RTD got it right, on the whole. As you say, not perfect, but Jack is well rounded, interesting, and bisexuality is only *one* part of his character... that one trait doesn't swallow all the other things Jack is. And when you can get that *balance* right, you can go for the cheap joke once in a while.RTD's work is quite interesting from a sexuality perspective because he threw a concept into sharp relief in Queer as Folk (he was the original author, as QaF started in the UK). Stuart Jones (Brian Kinney in the US version) is selfish, vain, abusive, and sex obsessed (at least in the beginning). He uses drugs, parties all night, doesn't believe in relationships, and has sex with every guy he can get his hands on. In short, he's every possible stereotype about gay men that the straight world has, all rolled into one character. Thing is, everyone who moves in LGBTQ circles *knows someone* like that! (Ugly truth being reflected.) So why does it ""work,"" instead of coming off as an offensive stereotype? Two reasons: One, Stuart/Brian experiences character growth, which gives him a *depth* of character. Two, he's not *the* gay character in the show.... so he is not held up as ""absolute truth,"" just one uncomfortable example of it. In QaF, RTD achieved that well-roundedness by showing *more than one example* of what it means to be a gay man, both amongst the cast and through character development. And that's why *more* representation is the key to the whole problem. The more women and minority characters we get in our fiction, the broader the overall portrait becomes, and then it's not necessarily jarring or offensive to have a stereotypical minority character, because there are other examples (preferably in the same work, or at least the same universe). When a white straight man acts stereotypically, no one comes away from that thinking ""all white straight men behave that way."" But when a minority character acts stereotypically, most of the audience will accept that as the only way that character could possibly have been written, because they think ""all"" people of that minority *do* behave in that way... unless the author gives them some other example to counter the stereotype.So it's not that no one can ever write a stereotypical minority character... it's that if you're going to do that responsibly, you need to have counterexamples. And if you don't want to bother with counterexamples, but you want to write responsibly, then you need to be careful to avoid the stereotype.;Yes he does. And I agree - RTD (and John Barrowman) got the ""tone"" around Jack's character exactly right... which is why it's funny. Tone is a funny thing when it comes to writing... it can swing your point from valid to ridiculous or humorous to offensive in one fell swoop. I don't think it's a coincidence that the tone was right and Jack was played by a gay actor and the bulk of his character written by a gay writer. It's not that a straight actor and a straight writer *couldn't* have nailed the tone, or that being gay and being bisexual are equivalent - but sexual minorities generally *inherently* understand the subtleties of tone regarding sexual minorities as a whole, whereas straight writers/actors have to do some mental gymnastics (and probably some checking-with-people-of-that-minority) to understand how to strike the right tone. It's the same with disability - none of my current characters actually have *my* disability, or anything remotely like it. But because I'm ""culturally disabled"" (in the same way that one can be ""culturally Jewish"" - that is, culturally aware of what it's like to be disabled, the importance of my tone, and how to hit the emotions I'm going for vis-a-vis disability), when I ran my writing past those who *do* have the same disability as the characters, they replied, ""What are you checking with *me* for? This is fine."" Hitting the right tone required no massive effort on my part, even regarding a completely different disability, because I ""speak the language"" in both a specific sense (my personal disabilities) and a broader sense (navigating the world as a disabled person in general). That ability is the same reason I can watch something Marlee Matlin is in and know instantly whether the director/writer consulted with *her* regarding portrayal of a Deaf person, or whether they thought they knew better than she does. I'm not Deaf, but being disabled gives me an innate ""feel"" for tone in that area. It's not impossible to make mistakes (which is why it's still important to check!), but it's always easier to hit the right tone when your experiences give you an innate sense of the tone you're aiming for, and what to avoid.I think your examples of bigotry were spot on, no worries. And Stuart/Brian is my favorite character, too. In the end, he was the character with the *most* depth, I think!I agree, too, that a female doctor would be brilliant, but Moffat is *not* the one to tackle it. He has only one way he thinks of women, and a giant chip on his shoulder about how ""men get no respect"" - which, I'm sure, is why he's so lousy at writing women. When you approach writing about something outside your realm of experience with disdain or resentment, it's not going to go well. I liked how Neil Gaiman referenced the possibility of fluid genders within regenerations (the Corsair in The Doctor's Wife), but I think it needs to stay there until Moffat's out, and preferably, until they have more female writers on staff. Right now, that number is zero, and it shows. (RTD didn't do much better on that score, it must be said - under him, there was *one* female Who writer.);I have always loved the Alice stories, though, as a child, I did not care for Alice herself! I remember wishing she would be a little more agreeable and thoughtful towards all of the other characters and their delightful word play. Reading it again as an adult, I am struck by the realization that Alice herself certainly likes wordplay, but she seems to only recognize it as such when *she* is engaging in it. When the other characters play with words in return, she is vexed, puzzled, and irritated.On that note, I wonder how the wordplay translates to the non-native English speakers in this class - is it fun to discover new meanings, or do all the shifting meanings make it difficult to figure out what the characters are saying?;Certainly, I think it would be a fascinating thread of its own! Go ahead. :)I think it was the wordplay itself - both the shifting meanings, and the fact that many of the poems are fun to recite. For lack of a better way to describe it, the words *feel* good... I used to spend hours rolling them around on my tongue and in my head, contemplating how many ways one could say them and how each different way one said them might have a different meaning. (It is probably no surprise that I became a writer!) I love many of the ideas around words in the books - how the same word can mean different things, how one's choice of words matters, how words can bring ideas (and sometimes entire things!) into existence or wipe them away. The Alice stories are paradise for anyone who likes to play with the English language or think about the importance of all languages.;Agreed. Jane Yolen is also the *master* at modern retellings of fairy tales! She knows of which she speaks.;I would not want the job of trying to translate either of the Alice stories into another language. Both books are heavily dependent on wordplay, specifically *English* wordplay. All languages *have* wordplay, enjoy the concept, and engage in it, but not using the same words. Trying to find *one* word in any other language that has the *same* double/triple/quadruple etc meaning as its English equivalent would be a difficult task... trying to find *lots* of different words, all of which have the same multiple meanings to their respective English equivalent, strikes me as nigh impossible.I've read ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in both English and Irish - they feel like very different books, even though the story is the same and there is little wordplay. Because any given translated word will have slightly different connotations from the word in the original language, translating a book can completely alter the *feel* of it... even when it is a very good translation (as I would argue the Harry Potter Irish translation is). I can only imagine how skilled any translator would need to be to even *contemplate* translating Lewis Carroll... and surely, the meanings of bits like Jabberwocky are quite literally lost in translation, as they are entirely made of portmanteau *English* words.I suspect that is why it would be very easy to find the Alice stories ""boring"" in any other language. I have read certain Chinese tales and found them dull or incomprehensible despite good translations - only to realize that the layer I was missing was all the wordplay that works perfectly well in Mandarin, but for which there simply *is* no equivalent in English - at least, not without pages and pages of annotation to ""explain the joke!"";Anonymous, keep in mind that peer reviews are assigned randomly for each essay. By ""tightening"" your grading, you will quite likely end up punishing people who had nothing to do with the first round of reviews you got. I understand that you are hurt and I understand why, but because there is no easy way to converse directly with the people who actually give out unfair grades, it may be best to continue treating others as you yourself would like to be treated.I checked those spelling and grammar check sites out too, and was told I had 30+ ""critical"" errors... my writing is hardly without fault, but it's worth noting that I'm a writer by profession, have been published, and have been writing in English, my native tongue, for 28 years. In short, two or three errors, I could believe... 30+ ""critical"" errors in 320 words, I would have noticed! I'm fairly sure my peers would have too, and I got a 4.5. I don't know what those sites are calibrated toward (the suggestion of junior high, students age 11-14, sounds about right - or maybe very simple sentences for businesspeople traveling abroad), but many of the corrections they suggest are simply not correct at all, especially regarding things like subject-verb agreement. I suspect they are more of a hindrance than a help when it comes to a class such as this.I can understand how that might make you feel not sure what to trust or what resources to use. However, I'm equally sure that I'm not the only fellow student who would be willing to proofread your work and offer suggestions... this is a big class, rich in *human* resources!There is a Facebook group for this class here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/246393752160589Should you choose to join it, I'm sure you can find some fellow students who would be happy to help you out - I would be one of those people.;You have 24 pigs and 4 corrals (or pens, or boxes, or fenced in areas, whatever you like). The four pens are arranged along a circular path. Arrange the pigs in the pens so that if you walk from the first pen, to the second, to the third, to the fourth, and back around to the first, the number of pigs in the pen you are walking toward will always be nearer to ten than the one you are leaving.A little hint: Because this is a puzzle from Lewis Carroll, the solution is not purely mathematical - there is some wordplay involved. So, think about the wording of the question itself.;Sorry that happened to you, Andrew. Utterly unwarranted, as others have said. I distrust plagiarism checkers on the whole, because they tend to have a difficult time discerning a legitimately cited quotation from actual plagiarizing; they can be a good *tool* if you've been trained how to use a particular one, but using one is not as simple as pasting in the material and anything over 5-10% gets automatically called plagiarism. As with a lot of automation, a human has to check over what the computer came up with and make some intelligent decisions about the data.I was in a coursera class where plagiarism - quite blatant plagiarism, with 1000 word blocks of text lifted directly from a single website - was a big issue. We were specifically instructed to grade on content, and not form, grammar, spelling or syntax, because it was a public health class and no one (including those of us with good written English skills) wanted the non-native speakers to be at any more of a disadvantage than they would already be by taking a course in their non-native tongue. We were also given two weeks to write each essay, so the ""limited time"" issue wouldn't be so much of a barrier. In other words, the incentive to plagiarize should have been low. Yet, by the fifth round of essays, it was still going on (I saw several such essays with my own eyes)... very frustrating for the people who did the work. And, of course, there were the false plagiarism accusations, too.With that under my belt, the tack I choose to take is this   - I don't even bring it up unless I am *positive*. And by positive, I mean I can say, ""this section is plagiarized from this site (link) and this section is from this site (link), and you added little/no content of your own."" Yeah, that means some people probably slip by me. I won't say that doesn't bother me, but it would bother me a whole lot more to falsely accuse someone of plagiarism.Consider, too, that since this is an online class, the most likely way for a student to plagiarize is by using google.... which means if they copied large chunks of text, you can find them the same way the peer found the essay in the first place.   If an essay really looks ""too good to be true"", googling a few lines should be sufficient to give you an idea.But please, please be careful about assuming that just because someone writes well, they must not have written it themselves. Taking *that* attitude just punishes the best writers in the class, whom we should want to learn from!;Stephanie, oh my god, you're *right*! Totally missed the Disraeli/Gladstone reference, and now that you've pointed it out, I don't see how anyone who knows that particular bit of history could *possibly* miss it! Brilliant - thanks.;My favorite is still ""Because Poe wrote on both."" It is certainly not an answer that would be given by the Wonderland characters, but it has the same sense of playful-but-somewhat deep wordplay that Carroll so enjoyed.;Suzanne, it's funny how bringing different personal experiences to the readings can result in entirely different ""take away"" messages, even when two people have similar personalities. Like you, I am a very sensitive person. I can't watch horror. I have to be very very careful what kind of horror I *read*, and what time of day I read it (I love Stephen King, but only in the daytime, and I still haven't made it all the way through some of his darker stuff like ""The Shining."") I can't even handle ""funny"" horror like the Scary Movie series, cause it just scares me witless. I read a lot of historical literature, historical accounts, and lightly fictionalized historical accounts, some of which are a million times worse than anything King could come up with, but with those, I've always overcome my tendency to freak myself out by reminding myself that I have a responsibility to know what has come before me in the world (that's just my take, because my parents very much raised me that way. We're a little eccentric.)But A Modest Proposal made me *cry* with laughter. Not because I think eating babies is funny, but because as a life long student of Irish history, I find Swift's piece to be one of the most snarky, dripping-with sarcasm pieces of satire ever written. It reads as a howling protest, a thumbing of the nose, a ""You bloody tyrants want us wiped off the map, eh? (true, at the time!) I bet your next proposal will be *this*!"" And yet for all its scathing critique, it is of course delivered in (mostly) Parliament-appropriate language, heaped with a ridiculous amount of decorum, and you can just imagine it *actually* being a speech given at the House of Lords vis-a-vis ""The Irish Problem"".It wasn't, of course. But the things happening in that time period made you wonder if maybe, someday...Swift meant for A Modest Proposal to be *read* as a scathing critique of the British government's treatment of Ireland in his time. Unfortunately, he wrote such a good, over the top, pointed, erudite piece of satire, that even then, most people read it as comedy rather than political message.I can see how, devoid of the context in which it was written, A Modest Proposal looks like the macabre fantasies of someone who isn't in his right mind. *Within* context, though, the meaning becomes something altogether different.;The Stand is probably my favorite King book (""On Writing"" excepted, since that's more a biography/writing advice book, albeit one of the best on the market, imo). Closely following that are In the Eyes of the Dragon, Rose Madder, and 11/22/63. I find it interesting that King himself never thought much of Rose Madder... while there are some gory bits, to me, it's one of the best anti-domestic violence novels out there.On Writing is absolutely fantastic for anyone who thinks they even might like to write some day. You don't have to like King's work to find it extraordinarily useful and very refreshing in its approach. Rather than droning on for pages about vocabulary, he simply says, use your own vocabulary, whatever it may be. By all means, expand your vocabulary, enjoy words, but when you're actually sitting down to write: ""One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes.""Then there's this gem, regarding Strunk and White. After praising the manual highly, he adds, ""{Strunk and White have} ideas about where it's best to place the most important parts of a sentence. They say at the end, and everyone's entitled to "
False,St12,Coh1,0.5714285714285714,0,1,1.0,0.0348189,0.876717895,0.5,0.0,0.25,0.42768275,0.0,"Rebecca, if I recall correctly, Stephen King deconstructs that statement quite a bit in his memoir/writing advice book (it's called ""On Writing,"" and if you haven't read it, it's worth a look!). He provides lots of tips and tricks that have worked for him, but in the end, the main takeaway from his book is, ""Write however *you* write. As long as you know the rules, you can break the rules. There is no right or wrong way to craft a story, unless you're not being true to your own 'voice'."";Rebecca, yes, completely agreed. I think in this particular course, taking into consideration the wide range of experience (and English proficiency) of our peers, having an explicit statement is vital. A skilled writer can have an implied statement when the exact audience and purpose of the writer is relatively uniform.... that is, if a skilled writer is writing for an audience of equally skilled readers, concerning a topic that both groups are invested in. That's not necessarily the case here - our backgrounds, experience levels, and comfort levels with the written English language vary widely. Our audience and purpose is to write insightfully for the attentive, intelligent reader.... and that's it. Given that, we can't make assumptions about any *further* things our audience is bringing to the table, other than being attentive, intelligent, and looking for insight. It's only fair to include an explicit thesis, to give *all* of our peers something to hang their hats on, so to speak. There are a few different benefits to having an explicit thesis in a class like this.1) If the person writing the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis can make it easier to understand what they are trying to say, despite potential grammar errors. I try to give non-native speakers the benefit of the doubt in any way I can, and if they have an explicit thesis, I can usually ""decode"" the rest; making it more likely that I will score them highly. If I can't understand what they are trying to explore, I can't be enlightened or have my reading enriched! Clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.2) If the person *reading* the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis makes it easier for the peer evaluator to understand what the writer is discussing. The end result is the same no matter which side the English deficit (or tiredness of the reader/writer, or rush of the reader/writer) is on - clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.3) Whether you have an explicit or an implicit thesis, it's very difficult to formulate a thesis if it's not explicit in your own *head*. That being the case, and the word limit and diversity of the audience being what it is, it's probably best to express the thesis in its clearest, most explicit form.... since you (general you) should have that in your head, anyway.;For Grimm, I put two hours' time into 5 reviews, and most of that was typing feedback. For Alice, it was only an hour or so of typing (I was ill, meant to come back and add more suggestions/examples, and ran out of time). But I try to put at *least* fifteen minutes into every essay, not counting reading time. The way I see it, it's one of the most important aspects of class. If I'm criticizing something, I owe it to that peer to provide specifics and examples for how they can do better. If I'm praising something, I owe it to them to be specific about what I'm praising and why. And every peer deserves at least one bit of criticism and one bit of praise for form, and the same for content. It's the only kind of feedback we're going to get from this course, so the least I can do is to try to make sure my feedback is thoughtful, helpful, concrete, and of good quality.I'm not necessarily *limiting* myself to five reviews, by the way.... but so far, I haven't had time to give more than five essays the attention they deserve. I hope to have the time to go above the mandatory five at least a few times over the course of this class.;Oh, and by the way, Agamemnon, you've got a superfluous apostrophe in your thread title. Just in case that was another test. ;)Nice username, though.;Anonymous, NBC and MSNBC have been doing a pretty good job of covering it in the past day or two. It's no doubt they're late to the game, as usual (BBC World News and The Guardian newspaper online have been reporting on it daily for several days now), but NBC and MSNBC have caught up enough to start a) covering it, b) showing footage of it and c) analyzing it, at least a little bit. I wouldn't dare to claim that I have anything close to a comprehensive knowledge of what's going on from my position in the US, but I was aware of the protests, the general causes of the protests, the police reaction, and the reporter Peter mentioned.;Only two things make me consider a 1:1) If, despite reading the essay several times, I can't understand what the writer is trying to say at *all*.   I am a very patient evaluator - I will point out flaws in grammar or punctuation, and provide corrections, but I won't mark down for them unless they make it difficult to read the essay. Similarly, if I can figure out what you're *trying* to say, I will base your content grade entirely on that - not on how well you phrased it. After all, our purpose is supposed to be to enrich each other's reading - if you do that, you get a 2 or a 3 from me. But if I can't understand you at all, then you can't enrich my reading. I understand that not everyone has fluent English-speakers available to look over their essays, but if you know you need a little help expressing yourself, reach out! If you don't know any English speakers in real life, there are many of them in this course. I am one of the many students who is more than happy to help. I won't write your essay for you, but I'll help you find the English equivalent for what you'd like to say. There are also many language specific threads on these boards... ask there, if you'd prefer, and see if your fellow multilingual students can help. :)2) If, after going over the essay several times, I still can't identify what your topic/thesis is. It's entirely possible to write an essay in perfect English, but not really *say* anything. Try to pick a specific topic for your thesis - one that says something interesting about the book. Provide a few examples of this one particular interesting idea in the book,   discuss those examples to help you make that point, and then add a brief conclusion. Read over your essay once you've finished it, and make sure you're not straying off into completely different topics. You don't have room to wander! The higher the number of *different* topics you discuss, the harder it is for an evaluator to figure out which one is your thesis.;Exactly. Home Rule and its consequences is a very, very, *very* complicated subject that encompasses history, religion, economics, socioeconomics, politics, and more. There is a reason that The Troubles are referred to even now with capital letters and in the present tense, 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement. It's all way outside the scope of this discussion, and I don't want to bore anyone, so I'll leave it there, except to say this: If you think it is, or ever was, as simple as Protestant vs. Catholic or Irish vs. British, or if you think it's all a historical conflict, not at all relevant to the modern world........ well, I'm not Northern Irish or British, so I don't have the right to speak for those who are.... but there are many, many, many lost lives, on *all* sides, over many years, who would have given *anything* for the situation to be that simple. And though *I* am not Northern Irish or British, some of those lost lives have belonged to friends of mine - people lost in *my* lifetime to that conflict... friends of mine on *all* sides. Some were lost or maimed before the internet, when all we had was 5 seconds of shaky footage on CNN to try to frantically identify familiar faces under the blood, and 20 hours to wait for the police to allow phone calls through again... sitting up till 3am waiting for the phone to ring, waiting to find out if we could exhale. Wondering which would be worse, the death of one of my friends my own age, or the death of one of their parents. (All deaths, of course, have been equally horrific, but those are the kinds of morbid ruminations that cross your mind when your family is silently huddled on the couch in the dead of night, thousands of miles away, wondering just how bad this night will end.... all the while knowing that even if *you* and *your* friends and loved ones are spared, someone else in the world - usually several someones, sometimes dozens of someones - are mourning theirs.)And some have been lost or maimed after the internet, the news trickling in through sudden text messages, some heartstoppingly vague - ""bomb again..."" I learned to type ""Where? Is everyone alright?"" in a matter of seconds with only my thumbs. And then wait that same wait, shorter now, but still with my heart in my shoes, waiting for the rest.And you can only go through so many years of that before you no longer remember how to exhale. Not all the way. Not quite. The whole mad business no longer has ""sides"" when you reach that point, and life becomes an eternity of the calm before the storm. If you're lucky, when we're all lucky, it stays that way... for a little while. In your gut, you know there will more than likely be a next time.And that's the perspective of someone who is only, and has only ever been, on the outermost fringes of the experience.Like I said - it's complicated.Whatever Stoker's religion, he was an Irishman living in London. In his time, that was a *deeply* alienating experience. Depending on exactly where you're from and exactly where you go, that can still be true today (as can the reverse)... for the same core reasons, and due to the same old wounds that are not nearly as old as they seem.;I think as long as you are making a solid argument about *one* clear idea, you can write about whatever you want and get a good grade. I've had a few comments along those lines too, and the way they're usually phrased is, ""I would have liked to hear more about ____, but I understand we're all working under a tight word limit."" If that's the kind of comment you're seeing, take it as a compliment; you have ""hooked"" the reader, and they're interested in hearing more!If, on the other hand, the kind of comment you're getting is, ""I would have liked to have heard more about _____ instead of (second topic you strayed into,)"" that is a gentle nudge from your peers that perhaps you could have written an essay that was more focused on your thesis. Under such a limited word count, we have to be very careful to make sure we're discussing *one* idea in depth. If you discuss even *two* different ideas in your essay - even if they seem closely related to you - you simply won't have the room to explore either of them in a meaningful way.;Anonymous, you're welcome.That's a difficult question. I might be able to give you a better answer if I knew what your thesis was, and which facts you used - because it depends how closely your facts were related to your thesis.For example, let's say you wrote about the depiction of childhood in Alice, and you said that portrait of childhood was represented by wordplay, Alice's emotional growth, and the structure of the story itself (Alice's evolution from child to Queen). That would be a very good thesis for a paper that is a page or two long, but it's too much to cover in 270-320 words. In a situation like that, I would narrow the thesis to *one* of those things, and make my thesis:""Carroll depicts the magical aspects of childhood through his vivid wordplay."" OR""Carroll explores childhood development through the emotional growth of Alice.""OR""Carroll uses Alice's evolution from child to Queen as an allegory for every child's journey to adulthood.""Basically, make sure you're not trying to cover too much in your thesis for the length you have available to you.It's also worth noting that there's no pleasing certain peer evaluators, so the best you can do is write what *you* think is a solid essay. :);Unfortunately, it doesn't really get better from that perspective. When I was studying Frankenstein in school, I found solace in focusing on the monster more than Victor. He is an infinitely more sympathetic character, in my mind.;Sean, I had a feeling if I didn't post about this passage, you might be the one who would! I guffawed. I'm not sure of the meaning of ""polyglot"" in this scene either - like you, I can guess, but I get the feeling I'm missing another pun. All of that said, this passage has finally solidified into a decent thesis for my essay, after *days* of trying to find a topic to which I can do justice. Now I just have to *write* the thing... with blood!;Rebecca, that's the dictionary definition of polyglot, of course, but I wondered if Van Helsing's *meaning* might be slightly different. I like Sean's guess - that the captain swore in a way that Van Helsing couldn't translate and/or understand (even if it was in English). That would point to a certain self-awareness in Van Helsing's character that we've seen elsewhere in the book... he would essentially be saying, ""The captain said many other things, and I could infer from his tone that he was swearing, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what language the swearing might have been in - it could have been languages with which I'm not familiar, or possibly he descended so far into slang/dialect that I couldn't follow."" There is a third interpretation, but it's what I've built my thesis around, so I'll post about it after the essay deadline. :);I agree, the dialects are theatrically overwritten, and as many have pointed out, often incorrect to boot. But I think Stoker was aiming at something altogether different in this *particular* passage... I may post my essay on this thread after the review period, for further consideration.;Coming here to voice a general complaint that 320 words is not enough to lay out a good persuasive paper on this thesis topic. Sigh. Oh well. It's not as eloquent as it was at 500 words, but hopefully it's still interesting.;I think every writer will have a different answer to your question. Here is mine:I have always struggled with deep literary analysis; it does not come naturally to me. As you say, I can analyze intuitively, on a general level, but actually deconstructing the text line by line to find other/greater meaning has always felt, to me, almost like unmaking a beautiful quilt. When done, I might have a greater appreciation for the stitching, but I no longer have a nice quilt - instead, I have a pile of beautiful pieces, each interesting in their own way, but no longer *complete*.However, I've been writing creatively since the age of four (I'm 31 now). I write for hours a day, every day; it's my greatest love. And indeed, I write intuitively. When I *re-write*, though, I often go back, look through what I've written, and try to subtly enhance any themes or symbolism which inadvertently made it into my creative flow. I make sure to do so in a way that doesn't ""break"" the story... they're just small elements that a reader can find if they're so inclined. If not, they still have a good story to read.I'm finding my literary analysis skills improving as we move through this course, and the short word limit is helping me crystallize complex thoughts in fewer words than I normally would. Whether that will show in my future creative writing, I'm not sure. Certainly, previous literature courses haven't inclined me to write more obviously or intricately symbolic books... so far, that's just not my style.But I do think a course like this helps writers think about why they write what they write, and how best to say what they want to say. It's not that one necessarily needs to answer the first question (it's perfectly okay for the answer to be ""because that's what I like""), but sometimes pondering those things can lead to interesting flashes of insight. It's always valuable to think about one's craft, even if it doesn't affect what you do or how you do it.;Again, this is just my own personal answer; I often find that analyzing a story so deeply *does* take some of the magic out of it for me. Interestingly, though, it seems to have happened less in this course, and I just put my finger on why this morning.In most ""formal"" literature courses, students are asked to write very long essays, and rarely get to hear the ideas of others (apart from the professor/teacher's interpretations, and perhaps those of other official scholars whose work the student cites). So, the combination of having to write a very long paper examining several different disparate elements, and the limited amount of input in terms of others' views, results in a sort of creative exhaustion regarding the book - at least, for me. I very much feel that way about Frankenstein. Having written a 15 page paper on it 15 years ago, I have less-than-zero desire to ever pick it up again - it is a pile of pieces to me, no longer an interesting story.In this course, however, we are limited to choosing one small aspect of the work, making a brief argument, and then we move on. Additionally, we get to see the brief insights our classmates also have, which are often different to our own, or touch on things we hadn't considered. And, because we are not subjected to any ""official"" interpretation by the professor until after we have written our own, we are free to explore as we will. The cumulative effect of all these small differences, to me, is that I'm not creatively exhausted by trying to analyze the book (because I've had to choose only one aspect and provide only a few examples), and reading my fellow classmates' broad range of insights often helps me ""re-quilt"" the book, while still appreciating it in new ways. So, yes, analyzing a book can ruin the experience of the book itself... but I think doing ""bite-sized"" analyses and having the opportunity to see a variety of other bite-sized analyses helps retain the magic of the original experience.As to a recommended way for authors to analyze stories... I don't think there is one. Because I'm an intuitive writer, I tend to analyze intuitively, too... and mostly subconsciously, at that. If a book touches me as a creative masterwork first - if, in other words, it tells me a good story - then I'll often find myself ruminating on what made it good, just in terms of a general statement that I can file away for future reference. Sometimes it's a structural/stylistic reason, like ""the author writes dialogue that rings in my ears for days,"" and sometimes it's an emotional reason, like ""I related to that character, even if I'm not sure why (and I might think about that further to try to uncover the why)"" and sometimes it's due to a bit of symbolism that I subconsciously latched onto that resonates with me. A *really* good book will do all three. An example of one of those, for me, is a book called Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle. It's about a ten year old Dubliner coming of age in the 80s... and that's about it. There is nothing deeply symbolic about it, but it paints a vivid portrait of childhood that uses language that is true to life (i.e. the language used in the book is the language a ten year old boy from Dublin Ireland would use - a structural/stylistic choice that helps the story work), I related to the characters (as a person raised in the ex-pat Irish community, Paddy's parents and friends reminded me of my parents and my friends - an emotional reason the story worked for me), and, in the end, it is a ""loss of innocence"" story, but it's unique in that that loss of innocence is not presented as dark or sad or tragic... you close the book feeling that Paddy is changed, but that a slightly older, slightly wiser Paddy will go on to discover more exciting things about the world (both a structural/stylistic choice - the presentation of the theme as a positive element - and a symbolism choice, the loss of innocence itself). And having done that brief analysis just here and now, it's still one of my favorite books. Undoubtedly, if I tore it apart line by line, I could find more... but I have no desire to end up with a pile of pieces. :);""When we attempt to answer them as well, we end up with self-indulgent, heavy-handed monstrosities like Atlas Shrugged. :P""I literally laughed out loud. You've hit the nail on the head in more ways than one!I'm torn about Frankenstein at the moment - I loved it when I first read it, but writing that paper on it sucked every bit of life from the book for me. And that was with a very, *very* good English teacher who encouraged class discussion and *discouraged* the notion of any ""official"" way to look at the text. At the same time, I'm hoping that 15 years and the constraints of a 270-320 word essay this time around will help me look at it with fresh eyes. We shall see.;Dawn, good luck! I suffered through an entire year of Hawthorne back in high school because my English teacher had a crush on him. That's not hyperbole - she told us early and often that, ""If Nathaniel Hawthorne came back from the dead, I'd divorce my husband in a hot minute!""I found him *deadly* dull and predictable, but if you like your stories chock full of symbolism, you may have an altogether different opinion. :);LOL! I liked Hawthorne alright for a while, but I eventually burnt out on him and all of his favorite things, and I've remained so, sad to say. I can only take so much sin, hearts, red, ugliness-is-the-worst-thing-in-the-world, and the like. He had a very interesting perspective on the world, and he wasn't an unattractive man, but by the fifth straight month of him, I began to picture him as the nineteenth century equivalent of one of my many obnoxious classmates... the ones who would buttonhole me in the halls to tell me, at length and with great earnestness, that God was watching me and He loved me, but the wages of sin are death and if I didn't convert to their flavor of Christianity, I would never get to heaven. (I was first a liberal Protestant, then converted to Catholicism, and while I *never* discussed religion at school, that didn't matter... it was a small public school around the corner from a massive southern church which 99% of the student body attended, so they knew us by our absence, as it were.) Anyway, after a while,   Hawthorne took on that same feel for me... the earnest, intelligent, interesting guy who *always* brings everything back to the same subject in the end!Poe, on the other hand... rowr. As the kids are saying these days, ""I'd hit it."" :);Scott, that's not quite what I said. There's a reason I included the context in which I studied Hawthorne... the context affected how I saw the text, and I fully admit that. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to completely divorce any text from the context in which we have first read it. Not impossible, I grant you, but difficult, if we are honest with ourselves. Having been subjected to a solid nine months of studying Hawthorne (with no breaks or studying other authors in between), in an environment where my modern peers *were* preaching at me (it wasn't just me, by the way... it's a cultural/religious doctrine thing where I live, and that's okay) made all the religious notes of Hawthorne's work stand out to me. That's certainly not all there is to see in his work - believe me, nine months gives one a fairly good understanding of the breadth of what he wrote. I'm not planning on skipping Hawthorne for this course, so actually, I *will* be re-reading it.That doesn't change the fact that I'd honestly rather have a root canal. I am Hawthorne'd out. But I'll re-read his work, and write my essay, and try to find something new... which is what we are all here for, no?As for Poe, the list of authors who behaved abominably in their personal lives is long and varied. I like Hemingway,   F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Hunter Thompson, too, doesn't mean I do my own writing hopped up on drugs and booze, or that I condone incest. All art attracts a motley crew of sometimes unbalanced characters, and some are more unbalanced than others. But through their flaws, they sometimes find universal truths... for me, that's one of the things Poe's work does. I respect that it doesn't do that for everyone.;Lauren, all good points. I'm reminded of the people who condemn John Lennon for being a misogynist, an alcoholic, a drug abuser, often willfully cruel to those closest to him, and easily taken in to causes he didn't necessarily understand. All perfectly valid criticisms of his behavior. But one can like his work without condoning the darker aspects of what he was capable of, and I don't know how I would have turned out if I'd been asked to choose between my mother and father at age four, lost my only father figure at 14, and then lost my mother at 17. None of those are *excuses* for the times he behaved badly in his adult life, but it is easy to see how parental abandonment played into his tendency to act outrageously.;Again, I never said he was a paragon of virtue - I said that the context in which I was studying his work lead to my finding parallels between the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what he wrote and the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what my modern peers believed. You have latched onto one word (earnest) and have concluded that by ""earnest"" I meant *virtuous* in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth. One can be very earnest while advocating an offensive, strident, disrespectful, unnuanced, or amoral point of view. ""Earnest"" is not a synonym for ""honest."" ""Earnest"" means ""with great personal conviction."" A person can earnestly tell you you are going to burn in hell, or   earnestly tell you that one person's life is inherently worth less than another's, or earnestly tell you you were kidnapped by aliens last night and replaced with a pod person. It doesn't make what they say true; ""earnest"" means *they* believe it to be true.Do I think Hawthorne had deep personal convictions that he believed to be true? Yes. Do I *agree* with them? No. Which is one of the reasons I am not excited about delving back into his world.;Scott, no worries. I apologize for our lightheartedness, as it clearly touched a nerve for you; I certainly didn't mean any harm by it, and I don't think anyone else did either. This is a pretty intense course, and some of us deal with the heavy workload by being silly on the boards from time to time. I too find both men to be fascinating *people*, in good ways and bad, and I might like both author's works, had we stopped at, say, three Hawthorne novels/collections. Unfortunately, overexposure, the environment in which I first studied his work, and the fact that the teacher in question was far more in love with Hawthorne the *man* than Hawthorne the *author*, and told us so regularly (and, in my mind, to an inappropriate degree) ruined any ability I might have to *enjoy* as opposed to *appreciate* his work. I still *appreciate* it, in the same sense I do any author... but *enjoyment* isn't something I can find in Hawthorne anymore.At least, I haven't yet. We'll see what a fresh look does for me.;Lazy writing. ;) I kid, of course... in my opinion, you've already answered your own question - it is, indeed, ""prepackaged symbolic baggage and shorthand referential stuff from other books."" But by modern standards, using too many quotations and not enough subtle allusion *is* considered lazy writing, which is why books that employ too much direct quoting feel dated by today's standards.;I very much understand your frustration, but keep in mind, too, that we all have varying levels of proficiency (expertise) in English. So, particularly with regard to grammar and spelling, what looks excellent to one peer might need improvement in the eyes of another peer. I know that if I were evaluating essays in my second or third languages, I would miss many grammar errors; being fluent in a language is not necessarily the same as being fluent enough to correct someone *else's* grammar/spelling in print! It's also entirely possible for one to be very fluent in English but not be very good at spotting grammar/spelling errors... there are plenty of native English speakers who have difficulty with spelling and grammar. Ideally, peers would take an extra few seconds to make their position more clear. For instance, instead of ""Great grammar and spelling,"" one could say: ""English is not my native language, but I can find no errors,"" or ""Grammar is not my strongest area, but this looks good to me,"" or ""Your grammar and spelling is terrific - this is coming from an English teacher!"" (or an English major, or a writer, or ""one who loves to read,"" or whatever might convey that your grasp of grammar is strong).It's just a matter of adding a few extra words to clarify where your *own* abilities are on the scale. I know it's a very short peer review period, but if *many* of us make that little extra effort, perhaps peer feedback will become more useful.Think of it this way - if anonymous' comments, instead of being:""Great use of grammar and spelling"" and""Was terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling""Were:""Not good on grammar and spelling myself, but this looks like great use of grammar and spelling"" and ""Terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling. For example, (wrong word) should be (right word) and (incorrect spelling) should be (correct spelling). You need a comma after (word), and a period after (word).""Then the two comments would not look contradictory at all. One peer thought the grammar and spelling was good, but he/she admits English grammar is not their strong suit. The other peer considers himself/herself more confident in written English, and provides helpful examples for improvement. (The examples may or may not be *correct*, but if examples are provided, the person whose essay is being reviewed can then decide for themselves if Peer #2 actually knows what they are talking about!)I'm not saying those of us who are confident in our English skills are obligated to go through and point out every single tiny error - that would take more time than most of us have within the two day period. But if you're going to criticize grammar, provide at least an example or two. If you are going to leave *no*   criticism for form, and it is perfect in every way, then try to be specific about what you're praising. That way, we can all help each other.The same applies to content grading, by the way. Be specific about what you like and do not like, so that we can learn from each other. If you have specific qualifications (English teacher/student of English/voracious reader/writer) mention them. if you have specific difficulties (non-native English speaker/dyslexic/have a hard time noticing grammar errors etc), mention those. Toss that information in the third box for general comments, if you like... that way you can just copy paste that note into each essay you evaluate. Again, providing that information isn't a matter of ""bragging rights"" or self-deprecation... we are *all* intelligent, attentive students, in Dr. Rabkin's words. But providing that information can provide some valuable *context* for what you have said. Keeping in mind, of course, that just because one claims to be an English teacher or a writer doesn't mean they know what they're talking about, and just because someone is a non-native speaker doesn't mean they *don't* know what they are talking about. All feedback is worth considering, no matter who it comes from. But, particularly if you are going to be especially full of praise or especially critical of an essay, context is useful to have.;LOL. As my parents used to remind me, ""There is a bottom 10% to every graduating class and every profession!"" Also, this is the internet, so just because someone claims qualifications doesn't necessarily mean they have them.And before anyone else mentions it, there are plenty of non-native English speakers whose English is better than most native English speakers.So, my general suggestion is that disclosing any detriments or particular talents is helpful... if English is your second (third, fourth, etc) language, but you know you are very proficient in it, then the fact that you are a non-native speaker is probably not relevant - unless you run across an idiom or other construction which is unfamiliar to you, in which case it may be worth mention"

It's far from the greatest thing I've ever written... the word count got me on this one. I had to rework my conclusion entirely in order to fit in most of my  points, and it shows. Audience and purpose cost me words, since not  everyone is familiar with ""bloody"" as an oath!Careful study of Dracula unearths compelling rewards for  those who seek them. While Stoker   s portrayal of different accents and  dialects is often incorrect to the point of parody, in chapter 24, an  account that initially appears to be full of amusing Van Helsing  malapropisms also serves a second purpose;   when carefully examined, it  reinforces the importance of blood in the narrative.Van Helsing  recounts the beginning of his conversation with the sailors in broad  terms     Dracula arrives, requests passage, the captain    swear[s] much,     and later, the captain    swear[s] at [Dracula] in many tongues.    Van  Helsing clearly does not feel the need to repeat the exact words used.Quite suddenly, his manner of storytelling shifts, and he  does relate  the exact language:    the captain tell[s] him that he had better be  quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood,  before the turn of the tide, with blood.    We could interpret this as  Stoker providing his readers with some levity; the average Briton  intuitively realizes the captain   s actual words were    bloody quick,""  etcetera, in the sense of the well-known oath.However, the  discerning reader can also interpret the passage as follows: The captain  tells Dracula he had better be quick with his bloody (unclean) package,  for the ship will leave the ""place of blood"" (England, the site of the  attacks), before the turn of the bloody tide     the tide carrying Dracula  is indeed a symbolically bloody one, having been the route he took to  both begin and end his reign of terror. Van Helsing adds,    The captain swear again, polyglot    (further  drawing the distinction between unimportant swearing and important  references to blood), and relates that the captain does not want  Dracula, ""with blood [upon him], in his ship, with blood on her also.   Throughout  this passage, Van Helsing interprets    bloody    in a deliberately literal  sense, unlocking a wealth of symbolism and implying that the captain  does not desire Dracula aboard his ship for fear that granting a vampire  safe passage might stain his soul, or, indeed, the    soul    of the very  ship itself.;I think Lauren's main point is that some of our peers are using the review process as an excuse to be nasty as opposed to helpful. In order for criticism to qualify as *constructive* criticism, one needs to point out something that could be improved *and* something the writer has done well... thus Dr. Rabkin's instructions.There is also a little bit of finesse required in order for the negative aspect of criticism to be helpful. ""Your writing is not academically fit"" or ""This is terrible"" are not *helpful* criticisms, because they don't explain *why*... where, exactly, is it ""not fit?"" What, exactly, is ""terrible?"" The grammar? (cite the mistakes, and give a fix.) The wording? (cite the awkward phrasing, and give a fix.) The lack of thesis? (provide a possible thesis and explain where the essay drifts from the thesis.) Yes, that takes more time than ""Terrible."" ""Good."" ""I liked this."" ""You suck."" But that's what constructive criticism *is*. Note the instructions again, which say: ""An ideal response would note one aspect of Form/Content that the writer does  well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form/Content that the  writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear."" (emphasis mine). ""In ways you make clear"" is a vital phrase. No criticism is helpful if you do not make clear exactly what was good and exactly what needed improvement. Saying ""grammar sucked"" or ""usage wrong"" or ""essay not clear"" is simply not helpful. The writer knows that you didn't like it, but they don't know how to fix it, or even if they really did something wrong.And I would strongly suspect that some of the people complaining of ""contradicting feedback"" are themselves guilty of not being specific in the feedback they leave for others.I don't have any professional qualifications with regard to critiquing, I'm just a lifelong writer who's critiqued my peers in classroom settings, in writing circles, and over the internet for many, many years, all in non-anonymous venues. I think it's the anonymity of peer reviews and the short time we have to complete peer reviews that's breeding this brand of laziness in some.Note that throughout this post I have referred to ""some"" peers, not all or many - I have received great, helpful feedback, useless, vague feedback, and specific feedback wherein the reviewer clearly didn't know what they were talking about (such as that semicolons should never be used, only ""dots"" (periods)). I much prefer helpful feedback, and even feedback that is incorrect but honest and polite, to nasty or vague feedback. Since the feedback regarding semicolons was quite polite, for example, I am re-evaluating whether semicolons are appropriate for this audience and purpose. Had that reviewer just said ""bad punctuation!"" I wouldn't have known what bothered them, and had they been rude (""Your sentences are far too long. Dots are the only appropriate thing!"") I would have written them off (and been confused!).;Paul, all good points. I didn't read anyone in this particular thread as being unable to live with peer assessment; for myself, I have accepted it as the way this platform works, and it serves my purposes as a low income person who lives in a country where higher education is significantly more expensive than it is in the UK and EU. (One year of uni cost me $30,000 US, and I could only get half of it covered by scholarships, because few people have those sums lying around, so even affluent students compete for aid... effectively pricing out students such as myself, for whom even $1000 US is a princely sum. Needless to say, I am still paying off that one year of uni 15 years later.) I read Lauren's posts as frustrated, but willing to offer suggestions as to how to peer review in a more useful way. That's the spirit in which I made my post, too. Critiquing is indeed a difficult skill, and I doubt anyone expects all of our peers to be able to do so on a ""professional"" level; this course is not geared toward ""professionals,"" for a start, so that would be an unrealistic expectation to have.By the same token, if we wish to improve the usefulness of peer review feedback, there is no guidance or involvement by the professors regarding how to do so. In previous courses I've taken, when problems with the rubric emerged, the professors adjusted the rubric and clarified expectations. The leaders of this course are content to let us find our own way. That being the case, the only way to improve peer feedback is for those of us who are more experienced to explain where the problems are, and, broadly, how to improve them amongst ourselves. That's not just hollow complaining, in my book - it comes from a genuine desire to help everyone get the most out of the course... even, and perhaps especially, those who are struggling with how to *give* feedback.;"

Part of it is because I had to bow out of the Frankenstein essay (life got very crazy all at once, and I found myself both mentally and physically exhausted), and my brain very quickly gets ""out of practice"" at this kind of formal writing. Even when I'm out of practice, though, writing comes very easily to me... I usually glance over my notes, bang out 600-800 words in 20 minutes, and then spend the next few days paring things down and perfecting what I want to say. Revision takes time, but the initial act of getting my thoughts down is almost never a problem.Not so this week! I knew what my topic was, but I couldn't seem to form coherent sentences about it, let alone distill those into a thesis. It's at times like these that I realize what it must be like for people to whom writing doesn't come easily... I can't imagine how they manage, because mere hours of not having my ""writing mojo"" drives me around the bend!With time running out in the wee hours of the morning, my tea going cold, and a busy day ahead of me (effectively eating the last few hours of submission time), I was beginning to panic. Then it hit me... when I come up against these moments of inarticulateness in my creative writing, I put my headphones on and crank up the music... and I hadn't done that in a while. So, I loaded up three albums worth of U2 (Achtung Baby, Zooropa and How To Disassemble an Atomic Bomb, for the curious), turned up the volume, and went to work.Seventy minutes later, done. It's a ridiculous thing to forget after twenty-five years of writing, but the truth is, I always write better with a ""soundtrack.""... and often, when I'm struggling for the right words to put on the page, I do forget that!I once had the fortune to converse, very briefly, with Aaron Sorkin (writer of A Few Good Men, The West Wing, Sports Night, The American President, and Charlie Wilson's War amongst many others). I used my opportunity to ask him the same question in the title of this thread: ""How do you write? The ideas of a fiction writer are ephemeral, but what's your process? When you're sitting down to write something, do you have rituals or need things just so?""Here was his reply:""Story's what I struggle with the most (a handicap if you do what I do for a living.) My parents started taking me to plays when I was very little and lots of times they took me to plays I was too young to understand but I always loved the sound of dialogue and that's what I wanted to imitate when I started writing.          I worship at the alter of intention and obstacle. (Somebody wants something-- something's standing their way of getting it. As Neil Simon says, ""It doesn't matter what the person wants--he wants the girl, he wants the money, he wants to get to Philadelphia, it doesn't matter, he's got to want something."" I'll take it a step further and say that anytime you can substitute the words ""need"" for ""want"" you'll be in even stronger shape. The obstacle has to be formidable and the intention and obstacle will be the drive shaft of your story. Now you can start laying in themes and writing dialogue in your own style. (At the risk of being pretentious I want to recommend a 64 page pamphlet by Aristotle called ""The Poetics"". Basically, he wrote out the rules of what drama is. If I'm writing something and it's come off the rails in mid-draft or something's not working in rehearsal, it's usually because I've broken one of the rules and my job is to figure out which one and how.)       As far as my writing environment, I write in an office on the Warner Bros. lot and I have a small office at home. I play music in my car and hope that something I hear gets something going. I'm very active when I write--jumping up and down from my desk and pacing around and playing all the characters.        Woody Allen doesn't have a desk in his office. He writes on a four-poster bed sitting up on one elbow. Stephen Sondheim writes while lying down on a couch. He writes for 10 minutes and naps for 20 minutes. Stephen King whips off a trilogy in the time it takes me to shave in the morning. Sam Shepard used to drop acid, hop in his pick-up and drive to a cabin the mountains where he'd write True West in a weekend. Write the way you write.          Aaron""  Needless to say, that gracious note of his has survived about three hard drive failures now; I keep it backed up on the same three thumb drives I keep my writing on. (Redundancy is a writer's best friend in a technology driven world.) I was, in fact, reading it over again tonight, searching for where my writing mojo went, when I remembered I needed to put some music on already.So, for anyone still reading... how do you write? What helps you get those essays done... or whatever other writing you have on your plate?;Were I evaluating that essay, I'd be tempted to give it a 1 solely out of pique... I dearly wanted to write an essay on The Cask of Amontillado, as it's been my favorite Poe story since I was very small. If I couldn't use that (and, out of respect for my classmates and their time, I did not!), then they can't use The Masque of the Red Death!(I'm kidding about grading on the basis of pique, of course... but I would be very irritated indeed... and such an essay probably does deserve a 1 on the basis of ""did not follow directions."");I *wanted* to compare the two, but I would in no way have had room to do justice to either... not in 320 words. I am happy with my decision to focus on Poe alone, having now seen five essays that hurriedly summarize Poe and then hurriedly summarize Hawthorne, and end up saying little about either.I'm not saying it can't be done; I'm sure some people did it quite well. But for myself, I would've needed a good 800 words to work with in order to write a compare/contrast essay that was truly insightful. Given that, I chose to be insightful about one author rather than be banal about both.;"

I'm going to have to skim them and be uncharacteristically pithy* in my comments, because I really don't have time to be re-reading more Poe, much as I'd like to.

Arrgh.;Patricia, fair point! The Hawthorne section was quite well done, so I may give it a passing grade, albeit grudgingly. I suppose I was thinking about re-reading the unassigned stories because I like to leave thoughtful feedback even when the essay doesn't meet the requirements. In this case, though, since the author of the essay made no effort to follow the syllabus, it's reasonable for me to not put much effort into feedback. I guess I just don't like to appear as though I'm engaging in tit-for-tat, even anonymously, since peer feedback is the only form of feedback available to us in this course.So I wish I could afford to be more generous with feedback, if not the actual grade... but in the interests of time, I'll be taking your advice.;Essays are definitely improving. I gave my first 6 this time around, and was thrilled to do so. It was a truly flawless essay.;I really should be getting to grips with my Wells essay, but I can never resist a Who thread... Indeed, my Doctor is asexual.

He's capable of forming very deep emotional attachments, he just doesn't want to shag. ;) ;I'm fairly sure that statement is just clarifying that the grading process is peer based. Put another way, it's saying ""Your grade according to a random sample of your peers is ___, but it may have scored higher or lower with a different peer group, or if it had been reviewed by a professor.""It is probably phrased that way for a few different reasons. In addition to clarifying that peer review is subjective, that statement may be pointing to the fact that the professor does have the option of recalibrating the grades or making certain portions of the assignment extra credit after the grading period has ended. Dr. Rabkin has chosen not to take advantage of any of these features, so in this class, the grade we receive is the final grade. In other courses I have taken, there were various avenues to improve your grade, if the professor retroactively decided to ""grade on a curve"" (because no one in the class did well), or to make part of the assignment extra credit (because most of the class forgot the second part), or by submitting your peer reviewed paper directly to the professor for a recheck, etc. All of these things are quite time-intensive for the professor, to my understanding, which may be why Dr. Rabkin opted out.

To be honest, having never read the story until now (I'm not sure how it escaped my notice for so long!), I was prepared for either a purely allegorical tale, or a moralizing tale about how disability turns people into savages, as the world often seems to fear even to this day. (It is difficult to organize an event purely for people with disabilities, because non-disabled people are for some reason always concerned that we will trash the space and have never learnt how to function in society... and then it is difficult to get disabled people to *attend* such events, as many of them are equally afraid that a large gathering of disabled people cannot politely conduct themselves, or will otherwise be a ""bad influence"".) So, I would not have blamed Wells for taking such an approach, as the strange fears and misconceptions still exist today; but I was gratified that he did not tell quite such a simple story.;Masako, true, and yet in the end, it is the sighted man, Nunez, who dies in the mountains. The Country of the Blind survives.The revised ending portrays the reverse, which raises an entirely new set of questions.;It is a ""pit"" to Nunez. Not so to the inhabitants, who praise its water, land, etc. Your interpretation is completely valid, but I think one of the things Wells is saying in this story is that the value of intangible things (like sight) depend upon who is doing the valuing. What is the value of sight if you live in a place where no one has ever seen, and sight is not necessary to accomplish any task? Nunez's sight *has* no value to the inhabitants. That is why he cannot become their King. What to him is priceless enough to risk his life for, is useless fancy to them. Similarly, the community does not find Medina-sarote beautiful, because she does not feel beautiful to the touch. To Nunez, she is beautiful, because she looks beautiful. The two societies (sighted and blind) value things differently, and those valuations affect how they see the world and each other. Nunez sees the blind as deprived and less than (recall how he can't bring himself to strike a blind man, insinuating that to do so would be morally inappropriate because the blind are at a disadvantage - a misconception he then finds to be untrue). The blind see *Nunez* as ignorant (""newly formed"") and less than, because he is bad at living as they do. There is no real ""right side"" or ""wrong side"" to this story, in my view. It is fundamentally about two societies who have completely different experiences of what the world *is*... and what happens when those two societies come together.Just food for thought... I can only walk a few steps, and that is all I have ever been able to walk. I have never run, and will never run. I feel no desire to ever do so, because I can travel faster than the average runner in my wheelchair, anyway. Thus, I don't consider myself ""deprived"" of anything. Ablebodied society does, though, and because ablebodied society *assumes* that I am deprived and unable, I have often found myself deprived of *opportunities*, on the mistaken belief that I am unable to avail myself of them. So, did the deprivation come about because I am disabled, or because other people make assumptions about what my disability means to *them*? Most ablebodied people would say that that deprivation is caused by my disability. I would argue that the deprivation in fact comes from erroneous *assumptions* about what I can and cannot do. In an accessible environment, or with a little time to devise my own accessibility modifications, I am often *more able* than most ablebodied people. To *me*, disability is not the problem, assumptions and prejudice are. To ablebodied people, their assumptions and/or prejudices aren't the problem, the problem is that I had the temerity to be disabled in the first place.Neither view is empirically wrong or right; it all depends on one's point of view.;I understand what you were saying. No worries, I am a fan of civilized discussions, and this is one of those. :) I agree that robbing Nunez of his sight was not the right choice. That, to me, was one of the most interesting parts of the story, because I see a similar attitude in disabled communities today. At gatherings of disabled people, I am considered ""not *really* disabled"" because I can stand and walk a few steps. I have been disabled all my life, and do a lot of advocacy work on behalf of all kinds of disabilities, so that attitude is both amusing and irritating... but the fact remains, many people consider me ""not one of them"" because I can bear weight for short periods. Of course, the ablebodied world doesn't consider me one of them, either, so I often have one foot in both worlds. It's not a bad way to live one's life, and for me, it has worked well... but it does occasionally make me feel like I don't ""belong"" in either world.So to me, the scene where they decide to remove Nunez's eyes had a special resonance, because the disabled community as a whole still does suffer from this idea that only when we all have exactly the same disability can we work together for equality! This attitude is exactly why the disability rights movement in my country (USA) has stalled. We spend all of our time arguing about whose needs are ""more important"" or who gets to be ""first"", and end up accomplishing little for anyone.But that is, of course, a very modern interpretation of the story, and thus, such an interpretation is outside the scope of this course.;Thanks, Sean, I'll check that out!Hmm, I can see the religious perspective. Starting to wonder if I should go within a million miles of this story for my essay, as I'm afraid I might get penalized for interpreting it ""too literally""!;I'm still debating... I've got what I want to do blocked out, and it won't by any means be an exhaustive traipse through the history of disability rights/culture (because I've no room for that, it's off topic, and I'm not terribly inclined to do so). My hesitation comes mainly from the fact that this course *is* subtitled ""...our modern world,"" and I'm probably one of few in the class who brings this particular lens to the discussion, so it could, if written well, certainly enrich the reading for some/most, if handled through a modern lens *but also* from a literary perspective. I'm reminded of the essay I saw on the Hawthorne/Poe thread about ""Refrigerator Women,"" a concept that had not yet formed as a crystallized, titular literary phenomenon in Hawthorne and Poe's day, but which certainly applies. That, to me, is an example of a valid way to apply a modern concept in a relevant way, and I think I can follow that path.However, if I do go that route, I run the risk of peer reviewers thinking I willfully omitted or was blind (no pun intended) to the standard literary metaphors that blindness brings up... and that's not so, of course. It's just that that sort of thing has been done and done again, and this particular story said something different to me. With the revised ending (rocks fall, everyone dies... except the heroic sighted man, of course), the symbolism would have leapt at me first. With the original ending, and knowing that Wells had a penchant for using his writings to muse about how societies function (and fall into dysfunction), I see very different messages - not all of them good, but all fundamentally more interesting and more rarely encountered.You're correct, I've got plenty of room to hang a potential albatross around my neck on this one, but I like your idea of writing two and posting my preferred take on the forums, too. I think that's going to come down to time, so I'll see what happens.;(Warning, this may be outside the scope of this conversation - it is certainly outside the scope of the story!)I'm finding the discussion of proprioception vs. vision interesting because, due to my congenital disability, my experience is *entirely* different! I didn't even catch the error, because although both my proprioception and my vision are fine, my ability to walk depends on proprioception *and* vision *and* something else I've never been able to pinpoint... and, in fact, scientists are still trying to determine what that third something is via medical studies. Briefly, if I look down at my feet when walking, I will fall (immediately, straight to the ground). This former mystery has been solved due to research on the elderly; as one's balance decreases with age, vision becomes more important to compensate for balance (because visual input tells you how close you are to upright). Elderly people who look at their feet as they walk suffer more falls because their brain does not have enough visual input to tell which way is up!If someone crosses my path while I'm walking, I'll fall (again, the effect is immediate). If I plan to walk from point A to point B, and someone is standing in my path, my body freezes up and I cannot take a step - even if I can see that I have room to go around them. Because these issues have nothing to do with proprioception or vision, this is what scientists are still trying to figure out... what about that particular form of visual input causes the brain to short out the motor functions, even when the person can see that the person will only temporarily be in the way, or that there is room to go around? This happens to people with very specific medical conditions - multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, cerebral palsy (what I have) and some, but not all, stroke patients. The conditions share some common clinical signs, but each is a very different form of injury/malfunction in the brain... so modern medicine is still trying to figure out what's going on.;I find it somewhat amusing that in previous weeks, my reviewers all said things like ""I would have liked to see more about ____, but I appreciate we're all working with a tight word limit."" And this week, my reviewers all said, ""This would have been better if you had contrasted it with (between two and four additional works)."" Well, yes, of course it would have, if I had had the space to do so....;"

What I know about how oral histories/folk tales are put together could fit into the tiny container in which I'm carrying my knowledge of German history, but, they are certainly created by people, and those people's experiences will certainly have had an impact on the contents.  ;No.;Now imagine five classes like this.

None has been enriching 100%, but I will read them again before submitting my grade and try to see if there is something I have not spotted. I have faith in my fellow students :);Thanks Chelsea!Also, I'd like to point out that Indoeuropean is an hypothetical language: we have no record of its grammar or structures. It has been thought to explain the origins of all these languages (latin, greek, sanskrit, etc), the common root to them. But there is no way of knowing if it was spoken as we believe it was, it's all conjectural.  ;Well, you can always comment on that problem on the ""form"" part of the grading, and evaluate what they're saying in ""content"". One can fail in ""form"" but not in ""content"".  ;"

And I'm pretty sure you can't submit your essay in another language other than English, since you can't be sure that the people who will have to examine it will be Spanish (or otherwise) speakers. I really, really, REALLY, DON  T recommend writing your essay in your native language and then have it translated by Google, for instance, of another computer programm. This is course is in English. There are other courses in Coursera that are in Spanish, if you're not comfortable in English, you may want to browse those.  Just in case, the same message in Spanish:Luis, creo que no hay forma de traducir el video, al menos no se me ocurre ninguna. I estoy bastante segura de que no se puede entregar el ensayo en otro idioma que no sea ingl  s, ya que no hay forma de saber que la gente que lo vaya a evaluar hable espa  ol o el idioma que sea.

If this was an essay, it would have certainly enriched my reading.;I forgot to add: the idea of Alice's growing and shrinking size as a representation for the consufing of growing up can be linked with the bildungsroman. I don't know if there is an English term for it, but in case you don't know it, it's a novel of learning (the main character learns, grows up). While it's generally a boy who gets older (and wiser), I think it's something worth thinking for Alice...'s case. Maybe she doesn't grow up in age, but she does gain experience: you pointed out that her doubts in the beginning are turned out into confidence towards the end. I wouldn't go as far as saying Alice... IS  a bildungsroman, but there are elements of this genre in the text.;Remember 1's can't be more than 30%. You can't have put them all four a 1: that would give you 40%.;Interested. I'm.really.interested. Please post your essay on the mathematical patrons once the due date is gone... it sounds thrilling!;If you grade 5 essays, you'll have 10 grades to put, and that's easy for the percentages. It means minumun one 1: the rest is up to you, knowing no more than three 1s, and no more than two 3s. If nince should be 2s, then put nine 2s, don't feel obliged to put a 3 or another 1.  ;I explained my grading in some of them.By the way, Emma Thompson, I totally agree with you! There should be a way of responding to the comments. So far, I've posted my essay on another thread, hoping for more feedback and for the reviewers to show up and explain some confusing points. I wouldn't mind explaining mine, although I was pretty specific in my reviews (unfortunately, that wasn't the case the other way around). It's a bit frustrating that I took time to think of ways of improving the things I considered weak-points, and the rest don't bother to remark what mistakes in particular they find in my essay.;I love how you made an example of your point (the lacking of long, complex sentences) by using a long, complex sentence. Personally, I'm a FAN of long, complex sentences (Proust being my favorite author), as long as they are easy to follow.  ;Alison, in order to get a response from your commentors, you may want to post your essay in the other thread (that's what I did!). Also, reading another essay that I didn't have to grade (the first one of this thread), I congratulated the author for having noticing the same things as Professor Rabkin, so I say the same to you. If your topic was like any of the unit videos (from 2 to 7, excluding the introductory), then it must have been amazing!;Beautiful!;It would be great if we had more time for evaluating, but I don't think they'll change it. We'll have to adapt, and it will be a good learning experience in the field of evaluation as well :);I really enjoyed your essay. i think it absolutely enriches my reading. Some of the symbols you remarked are also pointed out by Prof.Rabkin is his videos (I'm surprised no one commented on that): your reading was as good as the teacher of this course, bravo.The sexual maturity that ""red"" represents it's not explained, so to a reader who hasn't made the connection between red and the menarca, that symbolism might sound arbitrary. I'd suggest it to be added (but of course, we all know the terrible 320 words limit).I'd like to read what your peers have said regarding form, if you don't mind.;I don't know why I got confused before-I can see all comments now. Thanks!;I agree with comment 4, and I understand your frustration with comment 1 (which is not written particularly well either... what is ""formulatition""?). I believe a comparative analysis is a valid one, maybe it would have been clearer to compare the Grimm's tale to just one myth? Since the essay has to be so short, it's not bad to restrain the analysis and make it deeper.;Was this your essay? The one you submited? I don't mean to be rude, but it's very odd... I'm confused.;I think sharing essays is a great way to continue the enrichement of our readings! I'll post mine along with the comments (some of which I totally agree with, while some others puzzle me). And I'd like to take this opportunity to see if any of my reviewers see this, if they can develop their comment. It would be great it there was a full discusion: I have no way of responding to the comments.My essay:When a character wants to perform a certain deed    magical or otherwise- in a fairy tale, they generally announce it. It is through their voices that we get to know the character   s intentions -we don   t generally have access to their thoughts. Given this situation, the importance of the speech is enormous, especially regarding its relationship with action.                                 If we analyze ""The Three Little Men in the Wood    we can see the performativity lies in the speech.   This doesn   t mean there aren   t actions without words, but that the phrases spoken have a material effect. This can be more direct, like granting a wish (the words become true: the reward the men decide to give the heroine), or more subtle (like when they ask for bread).                                 We can go further and hypothesize that the importance lies in the literal words and not so much in the intention behind them: the step-sister speaks her own sentence doubtlessly ignoring she is condemning herself.                                 Words becoming true not only happen in this story, but in many of Grimm   s. The fisherman calls the fish with verses (   The Fisherman and his Wife   ), the tailor saves himself from the armed guard by stating he knows they are at his door (   The Gallant Tailor   ), the robber   s bride relates the story of what happened to her in order to accuse her husband-to-be (   The Robber Bridegroom   ). And all spells are casted by incantations, which are in the end speech.                                 There are many examples where the spoken word has a great relevance. But perhaps the most important role it has is the constitution of the story itself. We have to take into account these tales were originally narrated orally: such situation is the first example of words bringing things to life. So, it shouldn   t surprise us much that in a world built by speech, words have such power of creation.  Comments:Formpeer 1      Sentences structure and usage are correct and well-written. At times it's difficult to follow, but the writing comes back to the main idea in the end.peer 2      Form is well constructed, easy to follow. I myself forgot division in paragraphs, but it looks more neatly this way. I'm not sure about typping space before, but not after - bothers me.peer 3      The overall basic structure of the assignment is quite good, and there is a continuity in thought between paragraphs. However, at several instances the use of incorrect word choice has resulted in ambiguity. Sometimes, the use of simple words can lead to better crystallization of our thoughts on paper.peer 4      This essay is gramatically clear. The exposition in this case is laid out quite clearly. He/she uses simple words in order to explain a complex theme in Grimm Brothers' tales, which I think is good, because not only scholars but everyone can get what she/he is trying to say. I consider that his or her ideas can be synthetized better next time.peer 5      The language is not very clear and do not really understand the basic reasoning or argument, perhaps would have made more sense if he started saying that stories are an oral tradition and hence the importance of words...Contentpeer 1      An interesting idea to focus on speech. Given the extremely short word limit, I'd like to know more about how you'd analyze more deeply by looking at fewer examples more closely.peer 2      If ""it shouldn   t surprise us much"", when why bother. Why write an essay on the obvious? The task was to enrich the reader, but if writer him/herself doesn't see meaningful insight, how can I see it.peer 3      The concept of the ""power"" of words is certainly interesting. I especially like how the writer has connected the importance of storytelling and the use of words in different contexts. However, I think this essay would benefit with the use of topic sentences to help the readers understand the writer's point of view better.peer 4      I think the content developed on this essay is interesting beacuse it deals with the basis of the tales: language. He/she gives examples in order to sustain his/her ideas, which is good and bad at the same time. It is good because I think examples are always quite didactic, but it's bad because they fill too much space in this essay that could be used in the deeper development of the ideas.peer 5      the arguments are very complex and not very clear, The idea is interesting but should have been developed in the context it is difficult to follow the logical argument of the essay.Other commentspeer 1      Overall an interesting writing piece!peer 2      I might not be good judge and I'm worse than the writer of essay, so feel free to ignore comments. Sorry for my english.peer 4      I consider you're in the right track, just try to balance the amount of developed ideas with the amount of examples given.peer 5      May be you can consider the possibility of investigate the nature of language in myth or the way of language is received by us through the myth determines what we think like Nietzsche said...;Poulomi, thank you very much! Specially about the structure of my essay :)As to the ""underground"" selection, I fail to see how can that be of importance: whether I've chosen non mainstream tales, or you've chosen one of the most known ones, that shouldn't matter to the analysis. I have to say I DON`T agree with your peer. As long as it's a Grimm tale, it`s worth writing about it (and valid).;Thank you Anonymous (who I take to be the person who posted their essay after Poulomi). Even if my peer 2 response may have been a little arrogant, I actually agree on that point: my choice of words was not the most happy one. What I meant to say was ""In a world built by speech, it makes sense/it  s coherent that words have such power of creation"". Anyway, this correction wasn't suggested by peer 2, he didn't suggest anything at all-that's the disappointing part.;Anthony, our essays were very similar! In content, I mean. It is clear that to power of the spoken word is fructiferous topic.  Just one small thing: you quoted The Fisherman and His Wife in italics, and then in normal way in another line. Actually, as it is a tale (and not the whole ""book"", that would be Children and Household Tales), it should be between double commas, as in ""The Almond Tree"", which you wrote correctly. You also forgot the double commas when naming ""Rapunzel"" the story, to set apart from Rapunzel, the character. It's a detail concerning form, but I thought it may be useful to point out, specially for unit V's essay.;On your essay: I think your main idea was interesting. However, the results looks more than a recollection of ""Red Riding Hood"" different versions. Even if you do mark the differences, the conclusion that states that the story remains the same seems to be lacking the other part of the argument: the similarities. Since you're dealing with various versions, a search for a common core would have been the path to that conclusion.On the comments you've received: It looks that your peer can't tell the difference between content and form. ""Your conclusion is not supported by the essay"" is a content critic, not a form one. The same happens the other way around: ""  I would avoid using overworked words"" is in regards to form, not content.And in a personal note, I totally support you on your choice of the expression ""In conclusion"". It's clear and pertinent, not ""un-college"" at all. But I guess that depends on the different backgrounds we come from.;I agree with peer 4 on his comment about form-the last sentence needs some kind of articulation. Other than that, form seems to be adequate.  In content, I think the most insightful comment was  from  peer 3.  By the way, I love that you posted your essay in a blog!*edited for grammar mistake;I can't explain the misuse, sorry, you'll probably have to wait for a native-speaker to do so. But I can point at other formal mistakes:""exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence""> put them, as ""them"" is the direct object of ""put"", not the subject (the subject is ""numbers"" that comes, obviously, before the verb).""The other numbers appears""> appear, as the subject (numbers) is plural. I'm surprised no one remarked on this, even if they are non-native-speakers. It's about the first thing one learns in english. A typo from your part, probably, but definetely something that should have been noted by the peers.Another inconsistency: you wrote the essay mainly from ""we"", but at some point you said ""one"": ""One can suppose..."" Perhaps you did so to set that bit apart, since the supposition wouldn't be yours (and therefore, not our). But from the structural point of view, it sounds weird to start with a grammatical person and then change it. I respect it if it was intentional and a style decision: I wanted to point it out in case it was a slip-mistake.I'm not sure about the word Antiquity. I've looked it up and it does appear on Wikipedia, but I'm not sure if it's used... may I suggest Ancient times? Again, a native-speaker can decide on this point.""  ancient folks believed that exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence""> would. It's like undirect speech.;The beginning is a bit confusing. A tension is a struggle between two points in conflict: life and meaning wouldn't be in tension. You may say that life is in tension between meaning and a lack of sense.""A secondary binary element"", which one is it? The only binarism seems to be voluntary association and family ties, which don't seem to me as forming a binary. Are you talking about different types of human relationships (friends vs family, the opposition based on the fact that we don't choose our family)? It is not clear. Neither is the pertinance of this secondary binarism, or what is it secondary to (life vs meaning? But I've already said why I don't agree with that opposition).After the first paragraph, however, the essay becomes clearer and easy to follow (maybe not for a 3 year old, but that's an exaggerated criteria, if you ask me). It makes a thourough examination of the tale. I particularly liked the comparison between the golden beginning and the opaque ending.  The thing I disagree with the most is closing the essay with a moral. If you watch video 01.02, you'll see a moral analysis of the Grimm's tale is unadequate: to a literary-essay-reader, it is of no use what moral can he/she extract from a fairytale. I want to point this out because the same case appeared on two of the essays I had to evaluate. I didn't grade them ""1"", though, if the arguments were presented correctly-there is value in that too.I don't think 4 is a harsh grade, it is in fact the most expected one, since 2 is what most essays should be. About the rhetorical questions: I'm not sure I agree with that choice (particularly the ones on the second paragraph), but I would never mark them as mistakes, I consider them to be part of the writing style, and they are not functionally wrong.The idea that a 3-year-old should understand your essay is plainly ridiculous. In fact, he shouldn't: it is suppossed to be an academic work. Which also means, you shouldn't write as you speak. Even if the subject you're discussing is oral, copying or approaching that form isn't beneficial; you should apply the academic conventions.  I hope you find my comment useful, if you have any questions, do post them. I'm open for discussion of course, so if you think I'm mistaken in any of my corrections, please open the debate.;Rosevarte, thank you for taking time in explaining further. Unfortunately, the issue is still unclear. You say ""Whenever one has to decide between two sides, then there is tension"", a statement I totally agree with. But then how can you see a choice to be made between life and meaning? As to the other binary, I still don't know what you mean by voluntary associations, in opposition to family ties. My previous question ""Are you talking about different types of human relationships (friends vs family, the opposition based on the fact that we don't choose our family)?"" was not answered. In any part of the story does Hans have to choose between family or anything else, so you can see why I'm confused.  About the morality analysis: my main critic is that it's not a literary analysis. The problem with  argumentum ad auctoritatem is when you use an authority expert on a certain subject, but to argument on a different thing: if I'm an expert on cooking and from that place I recommend you what color to paint your room, for instance (a very gruesome example, indeed). Appealing to an expert on the subject you're discussing is a tool used in almost every academical essay: you yourself quoted Barthes to support your theory. Still, I know you may disagree with Proffesor Rabikin's point, you're completely entitled to your own opinion. I won't argue with that.  I will argue however that a morality analysis of a fairytale isn't enriching the reader of the essay. Just like stating your opinion (the story was nice, it was aweful, etc) isn't relevant in an academic literary discussion, pointing out the moral learnings you may get from reading a tale isn't of pertinance either. Why? In the end, it's all a matter of opinion. If I disagree and think the moral is Don't wish for more than you have, for you may end up with nothing, we would have reached an impass: there is no possibility for discussion, since it is our believes (and not the text interpretation) what is at stake. On the contrary, the fact that Hans' travel back home takes the form of numerous trades is undeniable, it's in the text. Then, you may analyse how comercial activity and travelling work in the story. Remember: it's literature what we are suppossed to discuss.;I don't know what you should have got, since we don't get to see your essay, only your forum posts, and, as Paul John Morris remarks, these are generally written more casually.  In any case, I don't know if a spell check is a good tool-specially seeing the results. I advise you to re-read your essay carefully and look for mistakes yourself: it will always be better than a machine that functiones authomatically without reflection. I would never ever consider a spelling check an authority in spelling. Grammar isn't dissociated from meaning, so the person reading or reviewing must understand what is the subject in discussion in order to judge the form. Even if we talk of form and content separately, they are deeply connected.  If you think you won't be able to spot mistakes on your own work, make someone else read it before submitting it.  ;Paul, I'm very interested in reading your essay, would you mind posting it, along with the comments?  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=284If you aren't comfortable with that, it's ok, I'm just taking a shot :);It's 20% of 3s top.""you should look not only at grammar looking for mistakes, but at IDEAS, ARGUMENTS, CONTENT, STRUCTURE and so on"". I want to point out that both are required for evaluation, that's why it's divided in form and content. Grammar matters, although when thinking about the most enriching essay, I would definetely weigh it regarding the content section.;Indeed, I've solved the puzzle thanks to your clue. There are five possible distributions; what Suzan posted below is just one of them.;It won't necessarily help you with your essay. But it may awake in you things concerning puzzles, numbers, word play, etc., that can be found in Alice... and Through... I don't think solving the puzzle will help you in the essay, but it's a nice thinking exercise.  ;That would be a Wonderland creature response! Or maybe something like: They are both part of the riddle (tautological answer);Yes, I've watched and loved it. It is clear from the title of the movie that Lewis Carrol's books work as the hyppotext to the film. In my opinion,  Phoebe in Wonderland  has a far more interesting vinculation with the text than Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland-which I hated, no, suffered from beginning to end.  ;Suzanne, I supposse you don't have much experience in reading literature.  I have to agree with your daughter. Crimes is not what fairytales are about, which doesn't mean they are excluded.Think it this way: when you see a film, a fictional film, do you always like what you see? Do you always wish such things happened in read world? I'd guess not. That doesn't mean that a piece of fiction, either a movie or a book, can't be entertaining and enriching if it pictures war, mysery, cruelty, etc.Still, if you loathe reading about violent issues so much, I wouldn't recommend this course to you. Like Luis Felipe said, you can always quit it, if you feel uncomfortable. Dracula, Frankenstein, Poe's stories all have dark topics.  And finally, to answer your question as why aren't more people outraged: it's because most of us can see past the violence and darkness in fiction, and can tell the difference between fiction and reality. It doesn't mean we like or accept ""thieving, and beatings, conniving, child abandonment, abuse and lets not forget the cannibalism"" in our daily lives.;Fantasy's most common sub-genre is undoubtly fairytales, such as the Grimm brothers'. I understand that if you took wikipedia's definition of Fantasy you're disappointed. I must admit I was a little confused with the term myself. I was thinking about fantastic literature, as Todorov understands it. Instead, here what ""Fantasy""   refers to is closer to what I know by ""maravilloso"" (which means ""wonderful""). ""Wonderful"" stories are those where the time and space are unidentified, and different from our own, which means the worlds portrayed have their own laws, accepted as natural by their inhabitants. For instance, magic would be supernatural in our world, in ""reality"", but it's common in most fairytales. The fantastic story would be an in-between: a world much like our own, where strange things happen, making it hard to decide if there is a supernatural event or being, or just a logical explanation behind. The best example for this is, in my opinion, ""The monkey's claw"" by Jacobs -I think it was mentioned in one of the course videos.  ;Suzanne, I have not read ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", and it doesn't ring a bell either. Who is the author?You mention Andersen. Have you read ""The Little Mermaid""? Don't you find it as cruel and shocking as Grimm's tales?Bruce, I don't agree with ""I don't think it is possible to have an emotional reaction if we don't have a psychic connection"", unless by psychic connection you don't mean empathy but simply understanding of the psychic situation of the character. But even so, I've had emotional reactions to characters I don't understand.  About Oedipus: the greek tragedies are meant to cause admiration and horror (see Aristotles for that). In order to do so, the hero (Oedipus here) must have virtues worth admiring, so you feel empathy in a level, but flaws so you don't identify yourself completely: the horror would be too much, unbearable. Aristotles explains it better, I'm just stating what I can remember.;""this very bitter, rude and ignorant person is also taking just about every course Coursera has to offer."" How do you know? If they posted as ""Anonymous""... please share your way of knowing this with the rest of us!By the way, when I say they posted as Anonymous, I mean to say I don't know if it's a he or she, not that there's more than one troll. All the other anonymous -including the one I quoted- weren't trolling at all.Also, I want to appologize to Stephanie for turning her thread into an anti-trolling section instead of debating the femininity...   the troll issue awakes indignation so strongly, it seems everyone has to express their concern.;I prefer books, in general, but that's not always the case.  Movis I prefer to books:The 39 stepsTies:A clockwork orange*I'll edit as I think of more.;I loved your two mirror theory!The quote ""And if he left off dreaming about you..."" is used as the epigraph in Borges' ""Las ruinas circulares"" (The circular ruins? I don't know how it was translated), where a person dreams another person without telling him he's been dreamt. I won't tell you how it ends in case you haven't read it (it's awesome), but there's a nice twist.Of course, Calderon de la Barca writes on this topic on his play La vida es sue  o  (Life is a dream? again, not sure about the translation). This work dates from 1635.  And to finish with literature references, an Unamuno quote (Mist): What is the real world but the dream we all dream, the common dream? (I translated because I couldn't find an official translation);At first I was confused, as I hadn't read about anything you've said. Then, at the end, when you say it's from Tim Burton's film, it made sense. Please keep in mind for your essay that we're supposed to analyse Carroll's work, not film adaptations.  ;Of course not, I was just pointing out that focusing only in Tim Burton's film isn't analysing Alice in Wonderland. If you want to examine the meaning of the vorpal sword in Carroll's book, you can't refer to Burton's production, you must use Carroll's text. If, on the other hand, you are comparing different versions, that's another story. What I meant to say is, don't loose sight of what must always be part of the essay: Alice in Wonderland and/or Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll. I didn't dismiss your comment, it is of course a valid forum comment: but forum material, not essay. Just thought it should be clear.;Exaclty, epistolary novels were common at that time. If you wanted to convey the story using the characters' voices, what best way to go than letters? And diaries. They are excuses to make the different characters ""talk"". It also makes the story more integrated, as well as varied. We have different points of view, different experiences, but not different stories told separately: they gather the material and put it together.  ;True. Even so, justification is usually provided: they say that writing calms them down, that it is important to document everything that happens, etc. It's a way to make it more believable. The activity of writing is always justified, and that caughts my attention enormously.;I'd advise a middle position. While I do believe the author's intention doesn't matter in your reading, considering only your interpretation can be misleading too. What I mean is, always work on your analysis rather than the author's-but don't invent something that the text doesn't say. That's what I mean when I say you shouldn't ""read what's not there"". Always work with the text. Looking for threads in a book will mean supporting your theory (audience participation) with quotes (textual work). This is in fact what Barthes does.  ;The movie Nosferatu (reference here  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/?ref_=sr_1) is a great film production on the vampires subject.  I have never eaten Count Chocula, but I know him from The Simpsons. They also have, that I remember, two halloween vampire stories: The one with Mr Burns as a vampire (that parodies a movie) and one that parodies Twilight.;One thing that caught my attention was that Alice says all poems she's heard that day (In Through the Looking Glass) are about fish, in some way. I fail to see fishes in the Jabberwocky (although one can argue she has read it, not heard it).  ;Hard to choose! I think the perspective is a powerful tool, and first person allows operations that the third doesn't (and the other way around too). I think I prefer first: to discovering the story along with the narrator, even if there are clues in advanced ( in the text itself, prolepsis if you will). Multiple narrators in first is awesome, an option fully explored in many books already, but that doesn't wear out.;If I had to choose a favorite book, it would be In Search of Lost Time, which is in first person. But it's a curious first person. The text also tells the story of Swann, for instance, in detail, from a time before the narrator was born. It even says what Swann felt and thought: in that part it seems really a third person. For pages, and pages (I don't know the exact number, but 100 wouldn't be exaggerated) the first person is erased... sometimes ""my grandfather"" appears, reminding us who is talking, but it is uncommon. Swann's story has even been published separately.  For those who can't decide between first and third person, Proust's book is an interesting case to examine.;Over two hundred? I only came up with five. I don't think there are that many number combinations. Maybe some of the responses derived out of the mathematical aspect.  ;I've just watched the last Unit II video, and the two hundred responses were for the raven/writing desk puzzle, not the 24-pig puzzle! I thought it was exaggerated...;Well, the cat's quote would be a possible argument for Alice's madness. But I see a progress rather than a losing her head (yes, word play intended with the Queen of Hearts) throughout her adventures in Wonderland. Even if she doubts of her identity, she becomes more and more sure of who she is:-After getting bigger for the first time, she questiones her identity, wondering if she's Mabel.-Later, when meeting the caterpillar, the insect asks her who she is, and she still cannot answer. But at least she can say she knows who she was that morning.  -Then, another enlargement happens, and she encounters the pigeon. She denies being a serpent (an affirmation of the identity, although through a negative way), and guesses she's a girl, with some doubts.  -When she meets the Queen of Hearts and is asked what's her name, she answeres Alice without a question. All her previous doubts have vanished. And even when later she suffers yet another enlargement, she doesn''t question her identity either.And about the cat's view: Alice at least doesn't seem to think it proves anything.  ;I am looking forward to Dracula, but not so much as I was looking forward on the first two units.;I must have missed the gay people thing... can you quote, please?And about stereotypes: think that this is Johnathan Harker's point of view. He's in a far away land, an exotic and mysterious place, so reasonably, anything that's different (and there are a lot of things) catches his attention and he describes it through his western european perspective. It won't necessarily be a negative aspect, but it's not strange that he points out the differences of cultures.;I'm definetely happier than with my first one. I hope I do better with the grade, too! But no matter the number, I know I've done a better job in this second instance.;That's great! I'm previewing peers' essays now too, and I'm really enjoying them, much unlike the Grimm experience!I hope you'll do better with books you like more. I think it's something that you wanted to ""say so much"" about a reading you didn't enjoy. That shows you're an objective critic! Or as objective as it can get...;Haha, self-boost confiden"

And the comments weren't very detailed. I suppossed it can happen for the first time, but for the secon time you have to evaluate, you should have learned the requierements: point out something positive and something to improve, and provide ideas for the improvement. In general, there wasn't much of that in the one-sentence comments I received.;If wouldn't be so bad if they told you those reasons, as you can improve from the remarks received. But when there is little constructive critisism, the same grade as the time before can be frustrating.;Post-modernism or post-structuralism is a critic position, whose most important exponents are Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. While I'd never quote wikipedia in an essay, I don't mind refering it in a forum:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism  (I'm not the Anon who first posted about postmodernism, I just joined in);I really liked this essay, it definitely enriched my reading of the book.I spotted one or two grammar mistakes, I think you should know which:""Alice's recitations of school geography and arithmetic while she falls through the rabbit hole in the beginning is equally incorrect,    but fun."" are equally incorrect, since recitations is plural. And it should be funny in the end, you're describing a noun, so you need an adjective. Like ""incorrect"", which is an adjective.""This also reflects the nature of Carroll, himself"" the comma is out of place.""compare thier own levels"" their. Typo, surely.  Keep up the good work!;yeah, do post it!;I loved it! Most perfect essay I've read so far. You did deserve a 6!;haha Javier. Because you are joking, right?;People may cite Freud to let you know they're taking him as reference and support. Whether you agree with it or not, you have to judge that IF taking Freud's point of view, the anaylisis makes sense or not.  ;It's not only right-left. Since a mirror is two dimentional, like a paiting, even if there is perspective, it  s not easy to calculate depth. Try to grab a single hair of your head. You  ll probably see your hand get closer and further from ""the line of the mirror"" (where the glass and the reality would meet). Ugh, I was probably not clear enough. Ok, see in Though the Looking Glass when Alice tries to reach the hill. Distance is inverted: close is far and far is close.;If you can think of counter-examples (specially obvious examples, that just pop-up by reading the text, such as word play), then you  re justified to dismiss the essay that ignored those things. One thing is to interprete differently from you, another thing is to ignore what the text itself is saying. If an essay can't see meaning in a literary book, either the author has not read it, or he has not read it. That's what I've said. We are suppossed to be intelligent and attentive readers, if I read a book at full speed and miss the meaning, I'm failing as a reader.  ;Laurie, I finally read your essay! Overall, I liked it very much, i think the metaphor of chess for growing up (from pawn to queen) was well supported by quotes. Maybe some further comparison can be added. For instance, chess is a game, which means there are rules, there is a winner and a looser. What do these things mean if we think it in correlation to growing up? You clearly mark how Alice defends herself against the Queen's questions and demands. Can we read that as a generational struggle? A new generation (represented by Alice who has just been made Queen) that has to fight with the old regimen (Red Queen) in order to get the place to rule. But maybe it's not so simple. If there is a struggle for power, why did the Red Queen explain to Alice the way to become a queen?I'm not so sure about the Harry Potter comparison... Harry is not a pawn, neither he nor Ron or Hermione become ""queens"" and since it's Ron who is deciding the moves, I can't see how the game can be taken as a metaphor for growing-up, like for Alice. You stated that the board is a series of trials and tribulations for Alice, like obstacles we may say. But the whole game of chess is one big obstacle towards the Philosopher's Stone, and it's not structural in the text like Alice's case. (Another detail there, remember to put in italics for the titles of books).If the thesis is that chess not only structures the text but also works as a metaphor for growing up, I think it's proved in your essay and that means it's a successful essay. However, I would be careful with the ending. By talking of the joy of Alice, while it's a colorful, innocent remark, it may be confused with the conclusion. In such a short essay, the conclusion may be found in the very last sentence, and I'm guessing that's how most readers will see it. You don't want people to think your essay was aimed at saying Alice is the most joyful of literature pieces that includes chess.;Stephanie, I liked your essay very much. I think it was interesting, well researched and it did expand my reading of the text. I did find it a little difficult to read, however. Not because of the technical terms, as one of your peers said, but because of other things. I'll try to see if I can identify the problem.-Alice stories could be descibed: described. Obviously, a typo.-There ARE casual models (a mistake found by Laurie too).-changes in 'natural order' into  a scientific world. I don't understand what you meant by ""into"" a scientific world. A world seen by the eye of science would not be ""unnatural"", so I can't see how a change in the natural order relates to scientific world. I supposed you meant to say that these changes respond to scientific theories (because you later talk about Theory of Chaos and so). But the way you put it, it seems ""nature"" or at least ""natural order"" is the opposite to science.-  The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.  I suppose ""this story"" means Alice in Wonderland, although you referred to both Alice's books before as Alice's stories. It's a little variation in the singular/plural form, but it matters. Because in the same sentence you use an ""it"" and a ""this"" whose referent is unclear. Both (changing singular to plural talking of the same thing and an unclear referent) are problems of text cohesion, and I think that's what makes the essay difficult to read. I think the ""it"" had an unclear referent because the previous sentence was  At the time, such changes were rampant and may have seemed random. Is the whole idea of the sentence the ""this"" and ""it"" of the next sentence?  The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.T  he last thing mentioned with ""this"" was ""this story"", so to use ""this"" to point to a previous idea is not the most adequate form.  -  look at Queen of Hearts and the White Queen.  Article missing for Queen of Hearts. The White Queen does have the article.-from seeming silly.  SeemingLY silly. Even if one of your peers disliked the -ly terminations, if they are required, they should be used. Silly is an adjective, and so is seeming. In order to make ""seeming"" modify ""silly"" you have to transform it into an adverb: ""seemingly"".-There are two examples of alternate models of causality that are also suggested. These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant. The first sentence promises the examples, which are never delivered.Why mentioning there are alternate causalities if they are not specified? If they are suggested in Carroll's books, where is that suggestion? If word count doesn't allow you to go into this, don't even mention other models and work on the one you've just talked about (the inversion of sentencing and verdict with the political meaning it portrays). About the second sentence I've quoted from your essay... again there is problem with referents and cohesion. I assume ""his"" means ""Carroll's"". In order to use the possessive adjective, you have to have mentioned the referent (Carroll) not too far away, definitely in the same paragraph. Also, you can't say ""these models"" since you've never said what the models were. Maybe you explained them in a sentence of two that were placed between the two I've copied, and you had to erase them due to having too many words. Remember when you cut things from your work to re-read it to see if it makes sense without the things you've omitted.  -Chaos Theory implies that inital conditions causes differences in outcome.  It's spelled initial, and the verb cause should be in plural (no ""s""), since its subject is ""conditions"".  -Each time, the conditions of where she falls asleep has an effect on how she experiences Wonderland.  Again, conditions is plural, so the verb should be ""have"". Can you remind me the times she falls asleep? I can think of only one, the dream that produces Wonderland. And there would be two with the second book, but then it's not Wonderland there, so there wouldn't be two different experiences of Wonderland. Maybe I've missed a second sleep in Wonderland, if so, please remind me of it.-Should these conditions have changed in the slightest, then the experiece would also be greatly changed. Experience, you've missed the ""n"". Here you're supporting your argument by assuming a change in the story that doesn't happen. That's doesn't make a very strong point. I would have preferred if you compared two specific situations that lead to two very different outcomes just because of a small alteration in the beginning (chaos theory indeed). there isn't a textual example of this in the Alice's books. I would like to provide some, but I honestly can't think of any. I think your other analysis of  quantum indeterminacy is much more supported by the book than this one.-The King and the executioner both argue.  ""Both"" shouldn't be there. An argument already requires two people involved. The situation would be different if they both ""talked about"" something, because they can do it separately.-It would only when they attempt to kill him that it would be known. It would only... and there's no verb! Maybe a simple ""be"" would have been sufficient. Also, for ""it would be known"", I'd change ""it""for something else. You're talking about whether the cat is alive or not. However, you've just used ""It"" for the impersonal first bit of the sentence (""It would only be""). Using two ""it"" in the same sentence to talk about different things is confusing. Try replacing the second one by ""the result"", for instance.-we can interpret that some things follow the laws of probabilty and not laws of causality.  Another typo: probability, you've missed an 'i'. I also wanted to copy the sentence to praise it: the idea is clear and it persuades the reader of your point. In another organization of thoughts, it may as well have been the conclusion: that's the level of clarity and pertinence it has.-It is a  story that attracts us to changes and dismisses them as nonsense as even having a few examples of non-typical causality implies that these changes are as mad as a hatter.  Up to ""nonsense""the sentence makes a lot of sense (ironically). I'd cut it there and then talk about the non-typical causality in a new, final sentence, as an opposition to the ""dismissing"". If the examples are the ones who ""imply"", then it should be ""imply"" and not ""implies"".  That's all! Again, I liked it very much, specially the cat analysis, which I found enlightening. Work on your cohesion and coherence, and you should be fine!;""The red queen explains   to Alice the way to become a queen as a parent would instruct a child. Children grow and challenge their authority figures as Alice starts to stand on her own and challenge the Queens"" I like this explanation :);Glad you've started this thread, Laurie. I'm exhausting from evaluating my peer responses. It took me a lot of time and dedication, and I received under-developed comments in turn. So unfair. I'm not saying all my peers were lazy, but most of them wrote one sentence in Form, forgetting to tell me the mistakes I needed to improve. Content was a little bit more commented, but just about.My essay:It is generally agreed that  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  are works of non-sense. The logic that applies in these lands isn't the same as in our reality. Focusing on the subjects of time and space, my thesis is that, while our normal standards don't apply to them, they are still not arbitrary.On the other side of the mirror, things work inversely. Distance (spatial issue) is not reduced when one approaches the object, ""I should advise you to walk the other way""(1). Similarly, the memory of the White Queen refers to the future: an alteration concerning time. To go backwards either in space or time is to go forwards, and the other way around.In Wonderland, Alice goes through numerous size changes. Since size is a spatial aspect, her shrinking or enlarging would be a spatial alteration. A possible significance is that Alice is maturing. The growing up of her body can signify her own growing up as a person. Even if her actual age remains the same, Alice does acquire experience and wisdom in her stay in Wonderland. But the process of maturing isn't straighforward, there are backsteps: she gets bigger and smaller alternatively. Growing up is related to time, but it is represented by a spatial form: size modifications.  Change can lead to question the identity. After saying goodbye to her feet she wonders who she is. After her neck stretches, a bird believes her a serpent. Both are cases of enlargement, and Alice learns on the way (2). Maturing can be unsettling (this strangeness is experienced in the fragmentation and deformation of the body), but in the end she answers to the name of Alice (3).The representation of time and space has its own law in Wonderland and the Mirror Land. In this last one, they adapt to the parametres of the glass: they work ""upside down"". In Wonderland, their relationship is metaphorical (the alteration of size/space means an alteration in maturing/time). In any case, there is no arbitrarism in the non-sense of space and time.Works cited:1.

Comments and grading:FORMeer 1      A very well-written essay, I believe.peer 2      Well written prose that flows smoothly.peer 3      Good structure, you have the point and go on describing it using cited examples. I also like how you ""save the words amount"" by putting sentences in cited work area.peer 4      Your structure makes sense and everything is clear in your text. The only thing that doesn't feel right is how you explicitly say ""my thesis is"" instead of working it into the text.Grade:2CONTENTpeer 1      A very interesting claim! You should have looked for outside references to support your claim, though. Or you should have looked more closely at ONE example in the text.peer 2      I like the way you spell the word ""non-sense"". It seems that we totally agree that Carroll has written some of the most sensible nonsense! Your discussion of space, time and maturation transformations makes a very interesting read.peer 3      You do make good point with Alices wisdom (represented in size), search of identity(""Who are you?"" question from the Caterpillar) analogies. Good examples in order to prove the point. One thing- first sentence is a little bit striking. It is too extreme. I don't think people who ever got to stop and actually think about Alice stories are able to call them ""non sense"". Those must be the ""non attentive students"". So just change the first sentence, think for the ways to show this idea in a more general, objective way. For the rest- very good.peer 4      I really like your thesis. I think it is quite insightful, although I find it a little reducing that you limit the notion of space in Wonderland to body changes. I get that you want to make a point, but I think one could counter-argument your thesis by asking about the spaces Alice travels to in Wonderland and how rooms and pools and gardens seem to appear and disappear. Isn't this arbitrary? Addressing that and defeating the counter argument in advance would have made your essay outstanding.Grade:2.;Laurie, thank you for your comment. Now that I think about it, it was indeed ambitious trying to cover both books.Jae Hee Kim, I understand what you say about working something less commented. I just thought I was going in a different direction by using Alice's growing-up as an argument rather than the conclusion. I still needed to explain it, in case the reader hadn't taken part of the forum discussions concerning the topic.;I think what peer 4 meant was that the opening sentence is an affirmation you're taking as granted, and that you should prove with a quote.;Wow, the idea of Russian dolls where the smallest one also includes the big one (Red King-Alice) is amazing. It is all said in the second paragraph. I think you can add the Dodgson-Carroll level, but, as one of your peer said, stating we are all the Red King may be taking it too far... it's not that it's wrong. I just think it's perfect in the second paragraph and that adding to perfection is impossible, so you'd be falling to imperfection again. Still, I think you could have got more than a 4.;I liked the analysis on the literary devices. One comment, though: mise en abyme is when you have the same structure/plot within itself. The classic mise en abyme is a portait within a portrait.So, when Alice falls asleep, a mise en abyme would be that she dreams she is dreaming (Nemo in Slumberland is this, in fact). Maybe there are examples of mise en abyme in Carroll's books, we just need to look for them.  The metafiction and self-reference are well identified.;I applaude your choice of subject: limited and therefore well-developed. You provide enough evidence to support your thesis, I think this is a very complete essay.;It's so unfair, I feel so outraged by this!I read five essays and wrote down on a notebook my thoughts on them. After watching the unit videos,  I read them again and commented them. It took me three hours to finish.The arithmetic mean of words used in my comments is 509 (I've calculated it). I know it says to leave a comment of 30-150 words, but if it needs to be detailed, I write more. It doesn  t hurt anybody (except me, apparently).The comments I've received are 325 words in total, from four peers, counting form and content (there were no final comments).  It wouldn't be so bad if those 325 words were detailed and specific. But most of them weren  t. So, naturally, I'm very angry.  ;I would prefer people to answer with useful comments, if they can do that in 30 words, I'd be perfectly happy with it. Most of them didn't point a positive and negative aspect, so they weren't following the rules. I've expanded my comments -I'm not asking they should do that, but merely state to the minimum required. What I think it's unfair is that in the end I've done more, and received less.;The fact that ""I did more"" only stresses the injustice of other people ""doing less"": that's the unfair part.Again, I'm not judging size. I counted the words to explain my point in numeric form, because I wasn't going to copy the comments all over (they're in another thread). Glad to hear we agree on the point I've made: thoughtful comments are wanted.;In order to achieve 1.85 of average, you have to have a total of 26 between seven of your best essays.;I can understand you don't relate to Frankenstein. My question is, why do you need to relate to any character to enjoy a book? Maybe that's not what you meant, but it's the impression I got from your first post.  John Graham, I love how you twisted the normal interpretation of the story (which would be the monster is not such a monster... well, what if he is?).;But Van Helsing approached the castle to kill the lady vampires.;Dracula, not particularly erotic? Are we talking about the same book, Bram Stoker's Dracula? I don't know if homoerotic, but most definitely erotic.  ;One correction: it's la petite mort, no noir. Noir is black, mort is death.;I was confused too. I suppose he is 6 years old, and tall for his age. Not older than 9, I'd say.;But were these contradictory comments from the same peer?  It's not unusual to receive different impressions from peers. As someone in another thread said, you can't please everyone.;Both Lucy and Mina open the window for him, so it works like an invitation, even if they do it in a state half-sleeping half-awake.I also want to   check a fact: does Johnathan say he would become a vampire for Mina? that if she becomes one, he would be willing to become one too just to be with her, or something like that.

Your thesis seems to be in the first sentence, but I don't understand what do you mean by ""newbie of society"". I know what ""newbie"" means, but I don't get how is it applied to Little Red Cap. You also state other ideas, like the grandmother filling the place of the godmother, but I don't see how it is related to the main point, unless I misunderstood such main point. You have ""thoughts"" about the story indeed, but pouring them all together in an essay without connection makes the essay incoherent.  ;In Spanish we also have two words, one for blue (azul... it's arabic origin, if I recall correctly) and one for light-blue (celeste, although I don't know where it comes from). We also say that the sky is ""celeste"" more than ""azul"", like in Russian. In fact, the flag of Argentina, my country, is ""celeste y blanca"", that is, light-blue   and white, because it is said the sky was the inspiration for it (Think of a cloud strip across the sky and you'll have the Argentine flag).;Uh, I really don't know. I just knew there was a Chinese version, where the tiny feet representing beauty   make more sense, and I thought that was the oldest Cinderella version. I would very much like to know the greek myth.  ;Thank you Amber! I hadn't interpreted Johnathan's words in that sense, but now that I think about it, they do mean he would become a vampire for her.Joseph, I did remark they did it in a half-sleeping state. That doesn't seem to stop Dracula.;He said ""child figure"", so the children Lucy attacks don't really count, they are not characters. A figure would be someone who plays an important role in the text, I think. Like Greg said before, even the wolf was more important.What does catch my attention from the video is that Prof. Rabkin says the children are attacked by Dracula, when we all know they are attacked by Lucy. Dracula would be the ultimate cause, but not the author of the attacks: the bloofer lady. Maybe I heard the video incorrectly, please mark me if I'm wrong.;If Dracula fed on them, why was Lucy covered in blood when they encountered her in her vampire form? And why were the marks on the children's necks smaller? I interpreted that as being made by Lucy, a recent vampire and hence, with smaller fangs than Dracula, THE vampire.;i like your idea Kim, it's convincing.;Um, Anonymous, this is not an essay, it's a forum discussion.;How are they similar?Wormtail is a traitor, he sacrifices his hand for his master, he can turn into a rat (Reinfeld eats rats among other creatures), he owns his life to his master's enemy. I don't see any of this in Reinfeld.Reinfeld venerates Dracula, is confined in an asylum, is obsessed with gaining life, but is worried about souls. He is murdered by Dracula. I don't see any of this in Wormtail.If you only take into account that they are both servants, this item is not enough, because Voldemort has many other servants, all the death eaters. Wormtail doesn't stand out among them, except as the one who helps him re-gain his powers and his body (although again, he's not the only death eater involved in this operation). Dracula, on the other hand, has all his powers when dealing with Reinfeld.;I agree that they are attracted by the power of their master, but once again, so are all death eaters. I understand they don't have to be the same in all the details, but just in one or two key items. The idea of servant that worships the power of his master doesn't seem enough to me, since it's too general.Maybe if you take the Wormtail case just when he's the only death eater by Voldemort's side? That would be between the third and fourth book. If you limit it to just that, it can be justified since Reinfeld is the only assistant of Dracula we know individualized.By the way, I love this discussion and I love that there's debate!;The first point -I agree.  The second, not so much. Lucy as a vampire is seductive, not disfigured. Also, her transformation is caused by an external source (Dracula). Tom Riddle (That is his name in English [and paragraph within paragraph: does Denem mean Riddle in your native tongue? I'm curious]) changes his appearance, but for his own accord.  And three-I also agree.;I get it now;I liked the article and agreed with it except for the last part, where it says that if people don't notice the intertextual references, you've done right. I think it's the opposite. Being able to compare, contrast and acknowledge the different inter-texts enriches the reading, it doesn't spoil it.  ;Cool, I didn't know where Horcrux came from, thank you!Also, vol de mort would be flight from death. It makes more sense :)Voldemort is a Lord but he invented that, Dracula's title is legit. Just a difference I think worth remarking on, because Voldy has humble origins, but not Dracula, who represents aristocracy.;It still makes sense, but I don't know if  more. Voldermort's main aim was to conquer death, so to flee from it would be the most coherent meaning.;It seems we have different views regarding Voldemort. I do think that he sought immortality, not power in itself. I can see it now from your perspective, and it's a valid one. But I still think his goal was to conquer death, not to be the most powerful. I don't agree on the point that he already has immortality when he chose the name Voldemort, nor that he ever achieved it. He had horcruxes, yes, but these could be destroyed, as they were in fact. If he had indeed achieve immortality, he would never had died. He was the one who got the closest to get it, but still didn't have it.  Why I think his battle was against death? Somewhere in his fight with Dumbledore (book 5) he says something like ""there's nothing worse than death"". He lost all his powers -or almost all of them- when he tried to kill baby Harry, but he was not defeated then. His ultimate destruction comes when he dies, not when he is powerless. That's why I state that his main issue was with death, not power.;haha, I thought the same! I told my family, I've just read the story that inspired Poison Ivy! Although I don't know if that's true.  ;It makes more sense that she links the horrible monster described by Johnathan to that apparition in her bedroom, than to link his supernatural apparition to a (true, mysterious) man she saw on the street. It seems she connected the impressions on Dracula (her present impression and her husband's past one) more than Dracula's physical aspect, which by context would differ from the stranger on the street.;How bad people were rude to you. I always point out the mistakes I find, but I've never insulted anyone, in fact, if I mark exactly what the mistakes were, it was with the idea they can be corrected and the person who did them can learn. What a horrible sentence. As you can see, English is not my first language either, but luckily I haven't encounter insults in my corrections (although neither have I found the specific mistakes I've made in form... hard to correct them if I don't know them).;I think the problem with stating your opinion is when you tell if you liked the book or not in your essay, and this is not productive. However, if you take ""opinion"" to be a literary interpretation of the text, then it's ok. How can you tell the difference? By being able to support your statement with textual evidence (quote or indirect citation).  An essay for an intelligent, attentive reader is supposed to widen the interpretation of the book. This will mean you shouldn't summarize the plot, but also mean you must base your affirmations in the literary work, not your assumptions alone.The idea, I think, is that if the reader of your essay later reads again the book, they can interpret it with the key you've provided, and that would produce a new reading. Think it this way: after reading your essay, will my reading of Dracula be altered? I know my reading of Grimm's stories have changed after watching Prof. Rabkin's videos, as Alice's reading has changed after some of my peer essays (two of the ones I reviewed were brilliant). If you can accomplish this, you will have succeeded.That being said, take into account there is a great variety of people here, and just like each of us have a different reading of the same book, it's not unexpected that each peer will have their own reading of your essay. Try to take advantage of all comments and all points of view. Contradictions may help us re-evaluate our parameters of writing and reading, and this, at least, has some value. So I thank you for opening this topic, it's always useful to think things over and not take them for granted.;Laurie, I started to read your essay just now and it sounded familiar to me... I was one of your reviewers! Since this time you haven't post the peer's comments, I can't tell you which one I am. Yours was the first essay I got to review, but I don't know if that means I'm your peer number 1.I'm surprised to see you got your lowest score yet, unless you scored all outstanding before... I gave you two 2s, which I think you deserve.;No, I was the one who commented on the abundance of the connector ""as"".  I don't understand why the other peers gave you 1, maybe the other essays they evaluated were 6s and they tried to compensate? If that's the case, it's really unfair. I graded two 1 this time, both in content. One of the essays didn't talk about the book, and the other interpreted all facts wrong and didn't even linked them to their thesis. These are serious problems in an essay. Yours, on the contrary, did provide with a clear thesis, arguments and a new perspective. It may not be outstanding for everybody, but definitely not worthy of 1.  ;Wow, Laurie, thank you!;Nice and attentive reading, Laurie. My critic on Kasey's essay was going on the same direction: it's a bit reiterative. The  entire  third paragraph could be eliminated, and the essay would still make sense.I think the remark of your peer, Kasey, was really unfair. Just because they decided to work on the same topic doesn't mean the essay doesn't provide with new insights. In fact, if they consider the topic didn't provide anything new, that means their own essay didn't provide anything new, since it's about the same thing.;My essay  In order to defeat Dracula, the characters arm themselves with knowledge. There are of course material weapons as well, but the ultimate weapon against the vampire is knowledge itself. Before confronting him, they investigate his nature. And when they start to chase him, they need to know what path Dracula is taking, if he changed transport, etc. Once they corner him, that is, once they know where he is, they win. There is a physical struggle (against the gypsies more than against the Count), but the victory is already decided.Powerful as it is, knowledge must be handled carefully. First, Van Helsing doesn't communicate his suspicion that they're dealing with a supernatural being to anyone until he is sure that is the case. He veils the information he has, but only to uncover it later to the rest, at what he considers to be ""the right time"". Later, when Mina is under the influence of Dracula, they need to be careful in telling her about their plans, lest the Count should discover them. Information and knowledge are always something to reflect upon before transmitting.Since knowledge is so important, it mustn't be underestimated, in any of its forms. Superstitions here have almost the same status as science, and both are used by Van Helsing. The scientific way would be a procedure of their own class.  Dr. Seward is a specialist, but all of them have the cultural background of the middle-upper class. Superstitions, as beliefs of the common people, would be related to lower class. The result is an interesting inter-class kwoledge, one which takes the superstition material and process it through the scientific matrix.Dracula is frightening as long as he remains a strange, mysterious creature. Once his nature is revealed, he can and is defeated. Knowledge and the recognition of its importance from all sources are   the requirements to destroy evil.  My peer reviewsFormpeer 1      The text is clear, the words are used wisely and there are almost no typos. The only thing that I missed was the use of direct quotes from the book to support your thesis. I know that in this case is a little bit abstract, but it could be used especially when you wrote about the superstitions of common people. Anyhow, well done.peer 2      Minor punctuation error and spelling error, but they don""t detract from the reading or understanding of the paper. Not sure if Dr. was really supposed to be italicized. If it's to emphasize that Seward is a doctor, why not also mention Van Helsing?peer 3      Your grammar, spelling, and word usage are all good. You make a number of very vague statements like ""they arm themselves with knowledge,"" and a number of meaningless statements like ""since knowledge is so important, it mustn't be underestimated."" Overall it's somewhat well written, but it's kind of hard to write a good essay around a thesis that is so vague.peer 4      Spelling, grammar and structure are correct.peer 5      This essay is grammatically accurate and the structure itself is very good. Although there are a few punctuation mistakes in the speech marks area, the rest is good and that note could be a note to be improved on. Overall, an average good form - essay.Grade: 2Contentpeer 1      I understood clearly your thesis and I can relate to it. It's well demarcated in the book the fight between common knowledge and science. The way both have to cooperate to defeat evil it's a clever symbology. I particularly liked when you wrote: ""Dracula is frightening as long as he remains a strange, mysterious creature."" In other words, when people have no knowledge of him, no information, when they are ignorant, that's when Dracula has all the power. This can apply to so many things in our lives and in our world...peer 2      The paper has no clear thesis, which would have helped hone and focus the paper. You talk about knowledge and then you jump to saying that victory is already decided. Many readers would disagree. In addition, you do not explain that point in your body. Why must knowledge be handled carefully in order to get the Count? You don't actually explain that in your paragraph. You also don't explain how they work with superstition of they are all upper-class members of society. You leap over too much info there and lose your reader. How does knowing Dracula's nature guarantee his defeat? You never explain that. It is another leap you make without helping your reader understand your position. Thus, you fail to persuade your reader of the validity of your position.peer 3      It really is not clear to me what you are trying to say. It seems like you're just recapitulating the plot of the story and highlighting places where people use their ""knowledge"" to fight Dracula. Have you ever met anyone who DOESN'T 'use' their 'knowledge?' It's not a bad essay, but the content is practically non-existent. If you had written about the narration style and how the story is told from the perspective of characters with limited knowledge, that could have had decent content. But instead, you don't really say anything of value.peer 4      Good thesis and argument. A few more quotes would be helpful.peer 5      The interpretation is very good and clearly explained, thus deserving a three. This essay could be improved relevance-wise, and if it was stuck to the point more it would be better. Overall, a great and clear piece of writing.Grade: 2Commentspeer 1      As I said before the only thing missing in my opinion is the use of direct quotes from the book. Having said that, I will put here some of the quotes I believe could be of use to your essay: ""...and taking a crucifixfrom her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous,..."" (p. 12) ""But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not - and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, ..."" (p. 33) ""Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help."" (p. 43)peer 2      You need to include specific examples and explain your position better. It starts with a clear thesis.peer 3      You write reasonably well, but you should think a little bit more about the essay topic. If you have trouble coming up with a topic, just look it up on the internet. Google: ""Dracula essay topics"" there are hundreds of hits. I realize that time is very limited, especially with a long book like ""Dracula.""peer 5      The content is very good! This could generally be improved grammar wise, since the content is very well written and the interpretation of Dracula is clearly explained. A thumbs up!My thoughts on the peers' commentsFirst of all, thank you, I received thoughtful feedback this time. Thank you for taking the time to write the comments.I'd have liked if they had pointed out the spelling mistakes. By the way, Dr. was supposed to be emphatic, but I take into account the suggestion to mention Van Helsing as well.About the content, I received contradictory feedback, peer 1 found it clear, peer 2 failed to see any thesis at all. I must work on being clearer with stating my thesis, a hard thing to do (I've been marked down for saying ""my thesis is"" in previous essays. The balance is hard to achieve). Peer 3 also had difficult in grasping the point, so again, I should have stated the ideas more clearly.Still, to say that the content is practically non-existent seems exaggerated and harsh.Peer 4 didn't elaborate much, but he did mark a positive and a negative thing. And peer 5 surprised me! A 3! Although that means another peer gave a 1. Was it really so valueless?  What I've learned: include quotes, referring to the book indirectly is not enough. Try to find a way of saying My thesis is without saying My thesis is.;Oh, and particular thanks to peer 1 who took the time to look for useful quotes!;Celine, it absolutely helps. You have clearly explained what went wrong in the essay. I thought that by taking one topic (knowledge) I was reducing the analysis sufficiently, but now I see I should have focused in one point concerning knowledge. Knowledge alone is too much for a 320 word essay.;Tan, thanks for your contribution. I like it as a possible discussion issue, but as you can see from the other comments, the problem was reducing the topic, not enlarging it. If I had expanded with Dracula's use of knowledge, I would have aggravated the problem. I do believe it  s an interesting thing to discuss here, however. Thanks for pointing it out!;Celine, I loved your essay! It was indeed mind-blowing. Things to improve? I suggest the following.>Don't forget to put in italics the title of the book. Particularly in this case, to separate  Dracula the novel from Dracula the character.> In preparation sounds weird... did you mean ""As preparation""?>""Instead""always followed by ""of"".>I don't think the Enoch comparison is well explained. By the Bible quote I only get that Enoch walked by the side of God... how is that like Reinfeld? Maybe it's my own ignorance of the religious text, but I fail to see the connection here.>""Stoker uses the idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christ to add an unfinished note to the story"" You don't really know if it was Stoker's intention, and in the end his intention doesn't even matter. You can point to an unfinished note, but not from Stoker: from your own interpretation, from the essay's development. ""The idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christian results in an unfinished note in the story"", for instance.  > Your peer 2 is right in pointing out that by the end of the book, Mina is no longer stained, the mark on her forehead is gone, and that means Dracula's blood is no longer in her. This doesn't make your argument collapse, but it does require correction. The threat of the vampire resurrection (well remarked in your essay) is cancelled in the end by the erasing of the mark in Mina's forehead.  ;Theo, I liked your choice of topic, it  s quite specific. However, there are possible counter-arguments you should consider: Mina can be seen as the ""New Woman"", something that has been thorougly discussed here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=180Also, Dracula's victims are not all female. Reinfeld is a man. The sailors were men. There was someone else, but I can't recall his name, one who was hired by Dracula to receive the box in a port.  It's not Stoker who makes the point that if Van Helsing hadn't been there... the narrator (who, in any case, would never be Stoker) is never a third person. It was either Van Helsing or Mina who concluded this.  I think that's all!;Hello. No, I don't think the essay was so bad, but there were grammar mistakes. If you wish me to point them, tell me so and I'll do it gladly =)The problem, that may have been due to little practise in writing in English, was that some points were contradictory. For example: ""Such details would normally not be omitted from novels written in the conventional manner, as they are superfluous and not necessary for the progression of the plot."" If they are normally not omitted, why are they superfluous?I thought that an important thing was missing, that later the diaries are read by others and therefore not written for the author of the diary alone, but on a second reading of your essay I realized you did consider this, by stating:  be read by either the writer themselves, or their closed ones. I still think you should have marked this more clearly, how the writing of the diaries would change (or not) once they are meant to be read by the team. But I know there's little space too.;I also do not recommend Google Translator.As for grammar and general form mistakes:>""By choosing to divide the chapters of Dracula into various chapters"". The chapters are not divided into chapters. It would simply be ""By choosing to divide Dracula into various chapters.>Like Sean Tobias noted, it's not immersed, but immerse. Basically, make readers immerse into character's thoughts OR make readers immersed in the character's thoughts. The first is like ""make someone do something""and the second ""make someone something"", that something would be an adjective, hence immersed.  >""the authors of such entries are often (...)  as they knew that..."" Don't change the verb tense.  >Harker's name is spelled Johnathan. You've missed the first h in the fourth paragraph.>If you take away the ""not"" of ""not omitted"", the sentence makes sense.>""Add to"", not into: by adding such intimate details to the novel...>""Bram, by adding such intimate details into the novel, it makes...""  Here you start with a subject (Bram) and then change it (it: it makes...). If you feel that erasing the ""it""after the comma is separating the subject from the verb too much, I suggest moving the clause between commas before the subject: ""However, by adding such intimate details to the novel, Stoker makes..."">You don't close a distance. You can make is smaller, you can reduce it. But ""distance"" is not something open/close, like a door or an issue of discussion.  >You tend to use the word ""by"" to mark cause. While this is not entirely wrong, it sounds weird sometimes. The phrase ""by their nature, diary entries..."" would work better with ""because"". ""By"" is used in the passive voice for the agent, or for a way of doing something: he defeated the vampire by cutting his head, for example. There are other uses as well, but these two were the closest to the idea of cause; I thought of pointing them out in case you were mixing the concepts.>based upon no: based on.  >""diary entries and journals lack the omniscient narrator, and are based upon the memory of the author themselves"" Themselves here is a bit confusing. I suppose you used it referring to author, neither male nor female. However, since you have a plural referent close (diaries and journals), it can be read in that way. Specially since the next sentence says ""their accuracy"" and ""their"" refers to the diaries. I would erase the pronoun ""themselves"" altogether, the idea is clear without it.  > it's just like how human nature is. A subject, even an impersonal one, is always required.>""Precisely due to their imperfect nature and reminiscence to reality, Bram, has succeeded in making the readers feel that the story had really occurred in real life"". If you talk about ""their imperfect nature"" it seems the next subject will be the ""they"" ""their"" is referring to. If it's too confusing, simply change it to ""the imperfect nature"" -you've already stated what is this imperfection and what does it apply to. ""Bram, has"" NEVER. I don't mean to be rude, just emphatic. Never separate subject from verb by a comma. And since he's making the readers feel, i'd say it's ""that the story has really occurred"". The past perfect is only used to mark a past action that happened before  a previously mentioned past action. Basically, if you don't have a past simple or continous before, don't use past perfect.  >""make them feel more for the trials"" make them feel more what? Sympathetic? Horrified? Sad?  You need an adjective.  That's all I've seen. As I'm not a native speaker, I can have missed other things, or judged the mistakes wrongly. But I tried to justify each correction. Hope this helps, please remember it's not meant to be rude, but to help you improve on your English :);Interesting indeed. I agree with peer 1 here ""man, as unevolved, conquers vampire, as evolved, which is directly contrary to Darwin"", except it  s not contraty to Darwin. I just think the essay needs to cover this point: if Dracula is ""more evolved"", what does it mean that he is defeated in the end? Evolution as a series of changes doesn't automatically mean the survival of the ""last one to transform"". The fittest may be one who hasn't ""evolved"" or changed. Darwin's theory talks about a struggle to survive, and changes are experimental, they may work or not. Dinosaurs didn  t. I also feel compelled to remark that peer 1 made this comment in ""Form""... out of place.Peer 5 final comment was the most attentive one, we all can learn from him/her.  ;Well, a 3 stands for outstanding. It doesn't mean perfect grammar and syntax, that would still be a 2. I think a 3 in form is the hardest to achieve. I have only graded one 3 in form last time, and it was superb. I mean actually outstanding, it looked like a literary author had written it. It was catchy, fluid, it was absolutely pleasant to read.  ;Claire, it seems your peer 2 didn't read your essay ""focused on one episode"". Just because you start with one episode, but there is another mentioned: Mina as a God's woman. Even if there was only one episode, it is possible to make an essay analysing just that.  While I was reading it, I also felt it was diverted, but since you connect all the arguments in the end, it's a complete work.  ;This is very common in literature. The oldest ""nested story"" I can think of is A thousand and one Nights. Also, at the top of my head,  The Golden Ass, Wuthering Heights, and Ethan Frome.Cloud Atlas (a book I highly recommend) is described as a set of Russian dolls, because you have many stories within stories. And it gets more complicated, because there are links between the narratives, threads of meaning, patrons that repeat throughout the book.  Jeremy, what do you mean by the monster's great great grand-daughter hidden in the core of the book? I've read Cloud Atlas, but it's been some months, and maybe I forgot the reference.;Ahhh, got it. Yes, from that perspective I can see it.  ;Why Christ against Marie Magdalene? I don't see how they're antagonists.I also can't see how the gypsies can be seen as apostles. Jesus taught lessons to his apostles, Dracula hired gypsies to carry him around. There were affectionate bonds between Jesus and the apostles; Dracula is egotistic and works alone.;Hello, Javier. Maybe you haven't noticed there's already a thread on this, under the assignments part of the forum.

He has been naked all along. The notion of fertility appears here because Adam and Eve realize they are naked, nakedness is linked to sex, and therefore, to reproduction. So, the disobedience would be leading to this particular form of gaining power.""Because we dont know for sure what would have happened had Adam not been cast out of the garden, he probably would have had more kids and of stronger form (had he obeyed)"" how can you state we can't be sure of something and then make an assumption of it? It's true that there is no way of knowing, I as well may believe he couldn't have had any children at all. After all, the first mention of  labor  (woman having children) happens as a punishment for the disobedience.I do agree on your analysis of Cain. The fact that he would live forever is no reward, but a punishment, since he won't be able to enter Paradise. Cain is punished for his disobedience.The eating of bread as cannibalism... it is linked, at least in a literal reading. But just as you can interpret the passage metaphorically, you can take the cannibalism metaphorically as well, as a communion for instance. But you can't ignore the cannibalistic sense: it says ""eats the bread, for it is my body"", so if the bread is his body and he's compelling them to eat it, he's compelling them to it him. (I didn't quote it directly from the Bible, I don't even have an   Bible in  English, so if I'm too far away from the text, please correct me).;There is a bit of a contradictio in the Bible concerning Adam and Eve's immortality (I do not mean to offend here). Apparently, they become mortal once they sinned and cast out from Eden: death comes as a punishment in The Fall. But God also says that if they had eaten from the tree of Life, they would have become immortal like him... so that means they weren't immortal to start with.  ""As for the cannabilism linked to the story of Jesus imagine we live in a world where everything is taken literally, well that would have been a total mess"" I didn't say you should take it literally, I said it is always a possibility, you can't erase the literal meaning, so you shouldn't ignore it. That means you can't say there is absolutely no link with cannibalism.  ;??

Specially the Aubepine analysis.I can see the Rapunzel reference inverted (going down instead of up), but I don't get why there are echoes in the name. Do you mean the title ""Rapaccini's daughter""? Or Beatrice's name?;Ah, OK, I thought Rapaccini came from ""rampion"" in italian, or something like that. I've just looked it up (in Google, I'm so lame), and ""rampion"" is ""raperonzolo"" in italian. In any case, there is the connection in the plants: Rapunzel is named after a vegetable, and Beatrice Rapaccini is well connected to plants, since her birth. The origin of both is green. :P;hahah, ok, thanks again for your contributions :);Walton too? But then, how did you explain the letters to Walton's sister? Frankenstein doesn't even read those.;But how do you support this theory? For example, it is possible that the monster never existed because there weren't many witnesses apart from Frankenstein himself: this fact is in the text itself. what element or elements in the letters make you think they are invented? if you imagine Victor made up the whole thing, why not imagine he's not Victor at all? Check Greg's Fishbone comment.  I don't mean to be rude, I just think that if you question something in a book, you should have a basis for it, specially if it's an essay and not just an idea casually suggested in a forum.;Interesting outcome, Andreja.  I'm a little confused at the structure. The first paragraph details the story  too much. By simply stating that Victor was under stress and with deteriorated health when he created his monster you would have provided the same idea, without using so many words. Contrastingly, the second paragraph seems to be interpreting some ideas, without explaining so much where do they come from: for instance you say ""He blames the books he read in his formative years for his madness"". Where is that said on the book? If you interpret it that way, you should justify it.  I'm wondering, did your peers noted this too?;This comment was much more interesting and enriching than any of the 6 essays I've read so far.I don't actually agree with you on the final point about the issue being outdated, but before that you make some very persuasive remarks. The analysis if eros and thanatos was amazing! You could write an essay just on that, and it would most definitely be worth a 3 for content.;It's a good idea, but there's a problem with it. The essays we do here concern books we've all read. You have to have the unit's readings ready when looking at a peer's essay. If we do an essay about any other book, you risk the chance that the person hasn't read it at all, and therefore, you would have to waste a lot of space in telling the basic things, or that they have already read it, in which case they would get bored with a plot re-telling. If your aim is to suggest new readings, why not try this thread:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=92? And if you have more books to recommend that don't fall in the category of fantastic, well,you can always open a new thread.  Maybe you could put one book per comment, along with a short essay/analysis afterwards? So those who have already read the book can take a look at the essay and comment it below.That would enable the writer of the essay to suppose a knowledge of the text just like our essays on the units of this course.;I can't believe it, Laurie, I reviewed another one of your essays! It was the first non-obligatory essay I graded. I'm the peer who said ""Good job :)"" in the final comments section.My essay   You have made me wretched beyond expression   . This is said by the monster to his creator. Excuse me, the other way around. The inverse accusation does occur, with different words:    All men hate the wretched, how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!    The emphasis (beyond expression/all living things) is put on the misery suffered: the word wretch appears in both discourses. Moreover, it is the term Walton (the only one who meets both monster and creator) uses to describe Frankenstein (1) and the monster (2). The relationship between Victor and his creation can be read in the usage of this word.Wretch  can either mean someone miserable, worthy of sympathy or an unpleasant, evil person. Both meanings are present in different forms of the term.    Wretch    the noun appears more associated with the second meaning, whereas    wretched    the adjective is more linked to the first.   The pair of meanings has a common core: they can be thought as    causing unhappiness    and    caused unhappiness   , noun and adjective respectively.Up to the first half of the book, when the main voice is Frankenstein   s, he himself is wretched. His unhappiness precedes the creation of the monster: when obsessed with his laboratory practices, he   s is not merry. And the arrival of the daemon    the evil one- only makes him more miserable. The first construction has the monster as the wretch and Victor as the wretched.But then, it   s the monster   s time to speak, and in his tale he is the offended:    what a wretched outcast I was   .   His accent is put into awaking pity in his listener, like Victor with Walton. Later, the monster insults Frankenstein by calling him    wretch   , reversing the first construction. Which one is the right one?The wretched man creates a wretch.  Because  he neglects him, and causes him misery, the creator is the wretch himself and his creature, wretched. The circle closes: the monster   s actions make Frankenstein wretched. The two constructions are not just two points of view; they complement and explain each other.

Peers' reviewsFORMpeer 1      It seems this assignment allows each of us to submit our writing quickly without editing and rewriting. I was able to pick up some good thoughts from your essay, but I'm sure they would have been easier to understand after one rewrite by you.peer 2      Your essay was an absolute pleasure to read. Its form is near flawless with well-structured sentences, supportive and concise paragraphs, and an interesting tone. I think your tone is what I'll choose to highlight here as it's an intriguing mix of conversational and formally analytical. That's hard to pull off, but you certainly have. I only find one mistake (""he's is"" in 3rd paragraph) and I'm pretty sure it's just a typo rather than a usage error. So I guess my suggestion for improvement would be a more careful proofread before submitting :)peer 3      All good.peer 5      The exposition and argument are very clearly laid out. There may be a few awkward phrasings, but overall good form.Grade:2CONTENTpeer 1      There is certainly an interesting juxtaposition between the monster and his creator - each sometimes the victim, sometimes the villain. It was interesting to identify the term ""wretch"" as symbolizing this.peer 2      Very interesting look at wretch/wretched! Your analysis and support absolutely serve the assigned purpose of enriching the thinking and reading of your fellow student. I think in less capable hands this thesis may have been a more limited vocabulary study, but your writing kept it closely tied to and deepening of the text. I'm afraid I won't be helpful in offering suggestions for improvement, because I think you should just keep doing what you've done here, making interesting connections and writing about them in a friendly yet informative tone. I think starting with a quote is quite effective for this piece, and all the quotes you use are seamlessly integrated.peer 3      Interesting argument with mightily interesting angle of evidence by using the word play wretch and wretched. Well thought out.peer 5      This argument is very interesting and provides some significant insights. My only hesitation is that it seems to me that wretch is usually used in the sense ""someone who is miserable"" and wretched as ""someone who feels miserable"" -- at least in modern English. That may not be the case in the English used at the time of Mary Shelley. Nonetheless, I think this essay provides a useful and insightful argument.Grade:2Well, I'm a little dissapointed with the comments. Unlike last time, there wasn't much detail about what I did wrong or needed to improve. Peer 2 did provide feedback, but 4 never appeared and 3 didn't feel like writing much. I still don't understand why peer 1 thought I hadn't read the essay before submitting it. He/she didn't provide any example for this impression.;Thank you very much, Jeremy, that was really helpful!I thought about the wreck thing, but since the essay space is scarse and I was marked down before for not being focused enough, I decided to stick with just wretch.I particularly appreciate your etimology dictionary link, I love etimology!;Sean beat me to it, I was going to point out that if you got all 2s and the average wasn't 2.5, they must make it approximate to 2.  As to giving feedback on my essay, do as you please! I would like yo know your general opinion, but I wouldn't demand a thorough examination.If someone corrected your   its   of ""its bonds"" to ""it  s"" they weren't paying attention to your essay, so don't take their remarks into consideration. People can be so lazy at reviewing...;Not late at all, it was helpful indeed. You illuminated me about the passive voice: in Spanish, we are encouraged to use it (or a variety of it) in academics essays. By the way, it's passive voice, not tense ;)I'll keep in mind the rest of the corrections too.;I don't know of any. Find an impopular thread, maybe :);I've also compared Birthmark with Oval Portrait! I hope we'll get to see different things and so enrich each other. The comparison I've thought was part of a larger theme (art and life), where I talked about ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""Rappaccini's daughter""as well, but I had to reduce it... it was too much considering four short stories.;I think it's OK, but I prefer after the evaluations close because you can post your peer's reviews as well.;haha Sean, you're hilarious!You didn't misinterpreted me at all. In fact, I understood Laurie's comment after your clarification.  The main Mexican what is named Santa Ana? If you don't mind me asking.;There is so much about the history of Mexico (and other countries for that matter) that I don't know! Thanks for the info.;Well, the form is a little ""shaky"", but the essay is readable. What peer 1 remarked I think can be solved by simply changing the order: ""by creating life themselves"". There were some puntuation mistakes (no comma in ""He demands, what all humans want""), spelling (""They sepend [spent] their last days""), grammar (""he shows that there's [are] no boundaries"").As to content, there were one or two details that you got wrong, such as the ""eponym"" referent, or the fact that Frankenstein is not a Doctor, the chasing each other at the end (Victor chased the monster, but not the other way around. Not in their final days, at least). Otherwise, the analysis of the inverted paralelism of Frankenstein and his creature seems all right to me.  ;I think your peers have said it all. The main problem was that it was unfocused. I found the gender role analysis to be very interesting. It would have been nice to have seen it developed.  ;I think the idea of the parent-child relationship is very interesting and well spotted. However, the essay doesn't do much more after pointing out the abandonment. The new insights I get from this are the fact that the abandonment doesn't reduce itself to the case of Victor and his creation, and that the destruction of the monster bride can be seen as an abortion. What goes in between these two ideas isn't much. And while these thoughts have a common topic, they are not related towards a main idea, a thesis that should be analysed or proved.  My advice is, first of all,  pay more attention to form. ""I found the parent-child relationships..."" You find something to be of a certain nature, for example: I find your essay interesting/plain/deep, etc. An adjective is wanted there.  Secondly, watch out for repetitions. ""he does not want to bring another creature into the world. This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world and raise it."" If an idea is clearly stated, then there is no need for repetition.  And finally, organize your ideas towards a clear end. You have some very interesting ideas, and I'm sure you can do this.;Awesome essay! So sad you didn't receive enough feedback, I'd be outraged if I were you.Regarding form: it is generally smooth, but there are in fact some issues to work on. ""influence of her parents"" influence on, not of. ""  Initial there is"" Initially. ""  As with the revolutionaries"" Like the revolutionaries. You can construct a comparison with ""as"", but scratch the ""with"", otherwise it seems like saying ""concerning the revolutionaries"".Regarding content: I think it was a very well thought comparison, and well justified as well. You base your analysis on Shelley's parents, but focus on the novel, not Mary's life: bravo. There is one arguable point, however: ""In the end, the ideals of the Revolution burnt out"". This is not true. The French Revolution has consequences even nowadays, it was a turning point in the History of Humanity. There is a before and after the Revolution. Even if there was indeed a drawback to ""the traditional fold"", it was never the same.I'd have graded it a 3 in form without a doubt.;You manage to support your thesis properly. But there could be counterarguments. Frankenstein isn't the only one who finds his creation repulsing. Think of the villagers he encounters, think of Felix, Agatha and Safie. But the monster does mantain a conversation with blind DeLacey. What can this mean? Do eyes deceive about real beauty? Are eyes an opposite symbol then from the traditional eyes>knowledge? Interesting topic to discuss about.;Hi, Jeremy, I liked your essay and found it interesting. I sincerely don't understand your peer 4, who commented about grammar in ""Content"", and didn't even justify his critic. Don't let this bother you and continue with your good work!;I've used quotes in the cited work section since essay n  2 and have never been marked down for it. I was even complimented on that once!;Interesting take into the monster's readings. Maybe you described these readings more than you analyzed them. I feel like the conclusion ""They result in the extraordinary eloquence, sentiments and understanding"" doesn't follow the argumentation, it is just presented and not so well explained. Maybe I'm reading it too fast. In any case, I can make a suggestion concerning form: (suggestion, not correction) use more connectors. The third paragraph comes a little disenganged, a connector just before ""Empathising with Werter he weeps"" and ""He manages to put humanity into perspective"" would make the text more fluid.;Yes, I thought about re-writing some of my essays, the ones I'm not happy with.;The discordance in the video also caught my attention. Because the Professor says ""Sydney"", but when the poem appears on screen it says by Edmund Spenser.;Querido An _nimo, soy hablante nativa de espa  ol, as _ que intentar   revisar el texto que posteaste reci  n, y despu  s comentar   sobre la evaluaci _n de los ensayos.""I go several trials I've done"" No se entiende.

What strikes me from his cause of murder is that it is similar to the cause of his own condemnation: the overacuteness  of the senses. The eye (visual) bothers him and he kills, then the beating (sound) torments him, and he confesses. The root of both is an hipersensibility, like Usher's. Even if you argue the beating is in his head (because we knoe the dead heart doesn't make any sound), they way he feels his guilt is through sound.;When it says we should seek counter-arguments, it means we should test the thesis. If you don  t find counter-arguments, then it  s a safer thesis. Seeking counter-arguments would be defending yourself against possible critics, because a counter-example may be pointed out by some peer. You shouldn't include counter-examples in your essay, unless you can explain them, but if you find some, you may want to revise your thesis.;I think it's meant to call your attention. If you see a thread or post with many points, you'll probably want to read it.  ;Same thing happened to Anna and me; we're discussing it here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=614;Maybe we have the same essay to review: I  m reading one on the Masque of Red Death right now. I decided to come here as well and discuss the matter.  One of the other essays I have compares the Tale-Tell heart to one of Hawthorne  s stories that are not included in the course. Since the Tail-Tell Heart is included, I let it pass. It's not different from comparing some of the unit's readings to another work, be this the Bible or Don Quijote, or whatever.But if it's ONLY about the Masque of Red Death... I  m sorry, but I think the person has failed to complete the requirements for the assignment: they didn't discuss the unit's readings at all. If in unit 4 I had analyzed Mathilda by Mary Shelley, I bet I would have been graded a 1 in content.;Why except those? Why isn't a comparison with any literature work valid?;Yes, it  s hard to judge what should be ""assumed knowledge"", as Emma put it. Because the course supposes inteligent, attentive readers, but intelligent doesn't mean widely read. One can be highly intelligent and haven't heard of Greek myths. I'd draw a line in the texts quoted or referred in the videos. If Professor Rabkin has already discussed The Fates, for instance, then I can name them without explaining the whole story.  ;I agree, wikipedia is not academic-like, but it's not so grave.;I agree, they shouldn't take for granted that everyone knows that story. Even if it is widely known, but specially if it isn't. If Hawthorne's most known work is The Scarlet Letter, I understand you can omit certain pieces of information about it, but if you talk about a short story...chances are the reviewer hasn't read it.;it is clarified in the before you read video of the unit.  ;Mm, didn't God forbid them to eat from the Tree of Knowledge only?

Unit II essays were the best I read so far, and then it fluctuated, I was expecting them to get better and better. Not always the case, I'm afraid.  In last unit I graded some 3 (either in form or content). Sadly, I had none in this unit.  ;Javier, I agree with the general comment that your essay focused too much on Poe and not so much on his stories. I wish to have seen more textual analysis.  As I starting reading your peer's reviews, peer 1 response sounded familiar to me. We must have got the same peer because   HE WROTE THE SAME WORDS TO ME, BOTH IN FORM AND CONTENT. I'm so sorry, but that means the person wasn't reviewing the essays at all. If you take a closer look, you'll see that his comments are too general and never speak of your or my particular essay: they can be applied to any essay. SHAME ON YOU PEER 1. (He was my peer 1 as well).;I like how it proposed a different reading than the usual, but it's true there are several grammatical mistakes that may difficult the reading of the essay. If you want to, I can do my best to point them out... I'm a bit lazy right now.;I agree with what Martha said about peer 3 and 4 balancing each other, and I think the right view is in the middle point of their comments (in my opinion). Like the rest here, I didn't feel like the quotes were too much or that they were on the way of the analysis. But I do think you lacked further development. Even if you don't simply summarize, you spend a lot of words re-telling the parts of the story you want to highlight, and there's not much space left for your own thoughts. The idea of Nature vs Science is a clear theme, as you say, and worked fine as a starting point. But you need to develop further/deeper, not simply stating in different words what was  already  clear in the introduction.It is, of course, a very well done essay, particularly in form.;Your essay isn't like any other I've read... the very definition of outstanding! You deserved a 3 in form without a doubt. If must have taken you a lot of time and effort. Bravo.Regarding content, I have to say that part suffers the geniality of the form. There is not much new analysis, just a comparison of two stories in the surface. Still, you managed to say something, so it wouldn't be worth a 1, but a nice 2 that means approved!;Oh, I think a conclusion can be poetic! And as long as there is textual support, it will be correct. Anonymous, remember it's supposed to be an interpretation, you don't have to agree with it, you have to judge whether it's consistent with the argumentation and relevant to the course's readings.;Uuu, I loved this essay! It certainly enriched my readings! But whereas it talked about an outside concept, it kept coming back at the literature. Complete success.  I don't think you needed a title, and even when the first person singular at the end was somewhat out of the blue (I doubted if it was a comment you added here on the forum or part of your essay), I think it works just fine and I would most definitely not mark it down.;The Women in Refrigerator's Syndrome doesn't really apply to two of the three stories you cited. If the idea of killing a woman is to ""further the plot"" as you said, how come both ""Rappaccini's daughter"" and ""The birthmark"" end with the death of the woman? I agree there is sexism in killing the woman, but I don't think it's explained by this particular syndrome you tell us about. It can work with ""Dr. Heidegger's experiment"", though. If you had only analysed that story, the essay would have been correct.  And I don't think considering the narrator in ""The Black Cat"" a male is ""male default"" (although this phenomenon does occur in many other ways, and a lot), because it is said the narrator has a wife. No gay marriage in Poe's time, so the narrator is doubtlessly a guy.;Risky form, and as you can see, some people find it great and other people disapprove. I like it, but just like with many cases where the form stands out, the content is left out. You do arrive at a conclusion (the heart of the title is not the old man's, but the narrator's), but the arguments don't necessarily lead there, simply beacuse there are no arguments but an attempt to reason with a madman. Again, I think this idea of talking not to the reader of the essay but to the narrative work you're presumably analysing (or its narrator) is very original and should be congratulated. But then you run the risk of lacking argumentation, which was the main problem here. I still think your essay was a successful one, and I would have graded you 3 in form and 2 in content.;The only correction regarding form I would make is not in fact a correction as a suggestion: always put the book titles in italics. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818). I assume you mean the book, not the character, since you referred the year and have put it along Hawthorne's works, not characters.  And the other thing I'd comment on is that Aylmer is not described ""as having a    love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy.   "", but the times when he lived are described with those words. I don't think it invalidates your point at all, but I think precision is needed.Oh, and answering your peer who suggested that instead of Shelley you could have analysed Poe: I don't agree. In Poe, the artist falls under the same fate as the scientists in Hawthorne: in ""The Oval Portrait"" the woman dies because of the painting.  ;I liked it very much, it offered a solid comparison. An article is missing in the opening sentence ""[The] beautiful garden..."" same with ""[the] creative efforts of a man"". Also, ""feel"" is just a verb, not a noun, so it should be ""along with the feel[ing]""""  Beatrice's unnatural talents, and the way Giovanni appears to be lured into the garden makes us associate her with a poisonous snake. Indeed, akin to an animal, her deadly ability is only a natural instinct she cannot be held accountable for, while her inner nature is pure."" Loved this. I felt I had to compliment as well as critisize and this part was particularly good, both in form and in content.  Great essay.;My essayBoth ""The Oval Portrait"" and ""The Birthmark"" end by telling of the death of the female protagonist, and the responsible for this is her husband, obsessed with his work. The woman rivals with the obsession (1) and looses, but at least ""the loss"" from this perspective takes the female figure as an active subject. Actually, the actions of the husband put the woman in a rather passive place.The action that results in death is scientific on one side and artistic on the other, but both of them deal with the concept of beauty. When the woman is seen under this restricted point of view, she becomes an object. Aylmer considers her wife as a matter to be moulded, like Pygmalion with her sculptured woman, and treats her like any other experiment. Even worse, the painter trasforms the image of her wife into a painting; the object here is tangible.This concern for the beautiful taken to the extreme links death to perfection: the perfect complexion, the perfect portrait. It was not enough for Aylmer that his wife was beautiful, she was to be perfect, just like the portrait simply resembling the model wasn't sufficent, it had to be Life itself. Nevertheless, this perfection is reached by different means. While the scientist erases an imperfection (negative work), the painter adds brushes and tints (positive work). Even if by doing this, he is drawing the life out of his wife, the action that concerns the canvas is by addition, not sustraction. When there is sustraction like in ""The Birthmark"", the result is a reduction: one life lost. On the contrary, the operation by addition results in a ""more"", and a ""less"" that compensates it: the portrait in exchange for the life. In Hawthorne we only have death (-1), but in Poe we have death and a new creation (-1 +1). There isn't a profit in any case. All the concepts are related: this economic analysis derives from the vision of woman as object or property.  Works cited:1. Poe: ""hating only Art which was her rival""; Hawthorne: ""it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman"".  >>>I was expecting critics on the structure and maybe an unclear thesis, although I assumed that anyone who could take the time to read it carefully could understand all points perfectly well. This was not always the case:Peer reviewsFORMpeer 1      The essay is well structured and easily read, attributing to its form.

Let's see if this time I can learn it properly.With ""women rivals with ---> women are rivals of"" I think you must have read the sentence too quickly, because it says ""woman"" not ""woman"", so the ""-s"" is appropiate. Rival is used as a verb, not a noun.I clearly didn't know how to write substraction and inserted a spanglish term there... oops.  And you're of course right about ""protagonist"" and ""character"".  ;Emmanuelle and Daniel, it is possible I reviewed both of your essays.

I   saw this course when it was last on and was really disappointed that I couldn't enroll as I found out about it too late. Fantasy is so much a part of who I am, I count the fantasy and science-fiction authors I love among my biggest influences in life! When I saw the reading list for the course I knew I just had to enroll. I want it to be an exercise in self-discipline and to develop my skills as a writer. I want to explore in explicit detail the subject that I am totally passionate about. To have a chance to talk with other people who feel just the same in a non-judgmental and relatively anonymous environment is something completely unusual for me and on the second day of discussions being opened, I've already been sufficiently rewarded in the reading recommendations and insights I've been privy to. It's just a whole lot thrilling.Also, Coursera is a fantastic resource and I want to give it all the support I can. The timing was right too: I just started on holidays for Uni.  ;Something else you can do is save the PDF to your computer.   Then, send that file in an email to your Kindle address.   In the subject put Convert.   This automatically converts the file so that it's easily readable on your Kindle and everything is done wirelessly.   I just did this for the Portable Edgar Allen Poe text and it looks great.   ;In the video we hear that The Great Detectives fall under the heading of fantasy because we know the world doesn't work like that. Detectives such as portrayed by Sherlock Holmes use skills of observation and deduction and always get their man. In the real world crimes go unsolved, this may say something about detectives or criminals, I am not sure.But if anything that doesn't happen in the real world is fantasy then is there another genre? What about the great romances. After all we know that being good and nice doesn't mean that we get the girl / boy at the end of the day. Things don't always work out in the end and Lassie doesn't come running in, give a bark, and we follow.  Is all fiction then fantasy? If not then could someone please explain the difference to me?  ;I love chocolate fish!!   - quotes from Conquer Club?;Don't you just love search engines?When do I get the chocolate fish?  http://www.chocablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/james-fish-2.jpg;I have some reservations about peer reviews, too, and it seems like a lot of you are jumping on Katrina a bit unfairly. Kudos to her for standing up for what she believes in or doesn't believe in despite all the adversity. This is my first Coursera course, but I am an art student and we do peer evaluations all the time at my normal school. In fact, for every project. I think everyone puts a lot of effort into the evaluations. Sometimes, we take an entire four hours to discuss the finished projects of us ten students. Our teacher, I'm sure, takes what we have to say into consideration, but he makes the ultimate decision when it comes to a grade. I know that's not possible with thousands of students, but it seems like there could be a better way to make a class like this work.From a grading standpoint, I worry about how to grade a 16 year old who is still learning what a thesis is and then turnaround and grade a 75 year old retired professor, whose written six academic books in his life. Furthermore, with all of the speakers who have English as their second, third, or fourth languages, I worry that I might not be able to distinguish a sophisticated idea because I'm distracted by the spelling or grammar or what have you. I feel that I could learn a lot from my peers through comments and I feel that I could help others out, but I'm not sure it is a just system where strangers of a variety of ages and academic levels and skills decide, points wise, whether another student passes or fails.Also, I just wanted to make a point about those who post Anonymously. I do it to protect my identity, not to hide my name from a post I would otherwise be ashamed to write (and then, childishly, delete).  ;"

Good luck with the reading and looking forward to chatting to you on the forums!;@ Cheri:   You're right, there has always been a wide range of quality in any genre, that was exactly my point.

Yeah, I'm not always the best at expressing my thoughts in words, either, so, no harm done. I totally agree about ebooks, btw. I've read some that actually have decent plot lines, but the writing is terrible (not just riddled with errors, but very juvenile, and that's being nice).;Hi Sean,I agree, it makes for a great discussion! :)  In the case of Frankenstein, I often consider the time period it was written (early 19th century) and the place (London). That was an interesting time indeed, when early advancements in science still intermingled with many of the old-world views of magic, the occult, etc. Romanticism was on the rise (which sought to critique both the Industrial Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment). One might think of it as an in-between period, a phase connecting the supernatural/alchemical/magical paradigm that came before with the technological/scientific/materialist paradigm that we are in now. Perhaps because so many things were in flux and transition, this is why it is difficult to define the genre of Frankenstein with such hard and fast rules? Gothic Horror might be one category. Fantasy (of the Romantic period) might be another. Science Fiction might be another. Perhaps they are all correct?  ;wow you guys good thoughts, Just a thought how many of our good fantasy/science fiction authors were under the influence like Edgar Allen Poe, who drank?   Ancient ancestors came up with fantastical creatures under the influence of 'shrooms,   when did man start adding in depth references to sex, to their oral/morality stories?   When did others start seeing these subliminal ideas?;Greg, I love your read of Six Soldiers. That made me laugh in my morning oatmeal. And funny as it is, it is a viable reading....;The expectation is that you'd read all of them for the course. Other translations/editions have many more (or different) stories; the Crane edition is the particular set of stories we're focusing on. Happy reading!;Nice answer. I learned something from that. Thanks!;I agree with you, William, and thanks for writing it. I couldn't seem to get the words out in a way that made sense. I shouldn't post at bed time.The question of fairy tale vs myth has been sloshing around in my brain. There is a clear difference. I was going to mention American Gods but decided that was more myth.... Disney hits up the fairy tales, more often... I'll have to look into if there is much adult-oriented fairy tale re-writing.  Anyone seen Grimm (isn't that what the TV series is called?). I haven't, but it seems that based on the name that would be worth a watch. We'll see.;Magical Realism, as I understand the term, is more subtle than urban fantasy. This is my personal interpretation, anyway. Magical Realism is where ""impossible"" things happen but no one blinks an eye - or just accepts that this is expect-able (yes, I just made up that word). ""The House of the Spirits"" by Isabel Allende would be an example - as, I think, much of the writing by Haruki Murakami (""Kafka on the Shore"" and ""The Wind-up Bird Chronicles,"" for example). These don't quite fall into the realm of fantasy (though maybe someone could make the case for Murakami edging toward fantasy... I don't think so...) but clearly they aren't ""real."" Special people see or talk to spirits, or know things, or talk to cats, or make journeys into pockets of other-worldliness, but they mostly live in the world as we know it. They just have some special rules that the rest of us don't necessarily experience.I haven't read much urban fantasy (I am thinking Neverwhere, American Gods (?), and something set in the Seattle Underground but I can't remember for the life of me the book... something about a devil.....), but my thought is it's basically gritty fantasy set in a ""hidden"" part of a city... kind of Alice-in-Wonderland like? Gotta take a trip through a rabbit hole to get there?But that's just conjecture.....;I wonder if a ""fairy tale"" by definition is a tale that has centuries of telling behind it? I'll have to chew on that. I don't know that there is a hard and fast definition of fairy tale, actually. I just did a quick search and found a wide variety of descriptions of what a fairy tale is.... how would you define it?That said, there is a large body of work out there using fairy tales (or myth....) fast-forwarded into modern times.  ;I was just doing some reading about the history of these tales, and found that even the Grimm brothers changed/sanitized/adjusted the tales for a variety of purposes. They published multiple editions in their life time, with a wide variety of religious adaptions, for example.... so it's not just translations but initial editions, too. I think the tales themselves are not a reliable record of what was actually passed from generation to generation.Interesting:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms'_Fairy_Tales;Interesting comment, Shaun. I've been thinking about the tales and how they reflect a peoples' thoughts on authority (maybe specifically royalty?) - and it made me think of red shoes, in general. Once, kings wore red heels (yes... HEELS!). So one could read Grethel's red heels and her subsequent ""great airs"" as a royal reference.  I've been tossing around this idea in re: the essay that's pending, and your comment helped me make some connections. Thanks!;I find myself increasingly interested in references to royalty, specifically stories that indicate an uneasiness with/distrust of royalty.  Six Soldiers of Fortune clearly has a king's untrustworthiness as a core element of the story. Clever Grethel has red heels, which makes me wonder if she's a stand-in for royalty (and she certainly steals and covers her theft through trickery); also, the red silk in The Death of the Red Hen may be relevant. These are just a few allusions and I haven't finished thinking about this.Of course not all tales involving kings or royalty qualify... but some seem to lean that direction.Anyway, any thoughts on this? If many of these stories are rooted in the experiences of the ""common man,"" then it seems that some tales would reflect an ambivalence toward those in power.;I wonder if the idea of ""common royalty"" is as oxymoronic as you think... once upon a time, kingdoms were small and plentiful... so the idea that there would be multiple realms (and multiple kings) close to one another isn't all that far-fetched...;The idea of royalty as a parallel to modern celebrity is intriguing...  ;The way women live within these tales is a huge part of why I dislike them so intensely. I understand historical importance, a part of the times, etc...but that doesn't mean that I have to like it. I'm thinking hard, but is there ever a ""warrior woman"" in here? Even the best of the women in these stories are at the mercy of men.  Not all ""classic"" folklore has women wordlessly agreeing to marriage simply because they were asked.....;The Raven is a good example, though this story, too, has a girl wordlessly marrying a king because he likes her looks...I think originally these tales were told by men and women. Yet they were collected by men, and subsequently rewritten by men.... so I would consider that they are heavily influenced by a male perspective.(I am in no way male-bashing, by the way...);Excellent resource. Enjoyed the reading immensely, and would love to read this collection! Would be interesting to compare/contrast with Grimm...;I think you're right on the money, Ann. I have been thinking about similar things (of course I start really getting my brain in gear AFTER I've written my little essay......). The idea that a woman's ""power"" - her ability to fix a problem (ie, brothers who are geese....) lies in her willingness to shut up, stick herself in a tree, and sew shirts of flowers... well, that is much different than going on a quest to find a golden apple.;I think that's a solid essay idea. These essays have a very small scope (holy cow they're short!), and this seems like a nice, confined-yet-interesting topic. Enjoy writing!;Interesting thread. Thanks.  So I'm in on the line of thought that the queen of hearts represents ""society"" at large - unpredictable, arbitrary rules that change on what seems to be a whim, crazy consequences always threatened but not really executed (excuse the pun...)...I especially like the comment of being ""too big for some things, too small for others."" I remember struggling like that as a kid, too.  ;I thought about that, too. I'm enjoying the video lectures a lot - and would have enjoyed the perspective. That said, I bet if we'd seen them before we would have read many essays that were variations on the videos' themes..... and, speaking for me, anyway, it could have made coming up with a thesis more difficult because I would have been afraid of ""copying"" the lecture....A tricky balance!;I just checked - they're still there!  ;So this was brought up in another thread, but it's interesting in its own right - so I wanted to give it its own thread....Identity. As I read through these two stories, I was struck at the concept of identity. Alice's identity is in flux through these stories. She forgets who she is (in the woods...), she is easily convinced that she doesn't exist (such a mean trick,Tweedledee and Tweedledum!)... She forgets the words to poems she knows and struggles to explain who she is....I'm interested in others' thoughts (as well as examples that I've failed to write here... bedtime!).....;I guess I hadn't thought about it much before; I'm not really an Alice aficionado. Thanks for the heads-up on that... I'll check out some materials!  ;In chapter 5 of Through the Looking Glass, Alice tells the Queen: ""I'm seven and a half, exactly."";I found them hard to score, too - even though I've graded hundreds of essays in the past. Only one of the five essays I read really ""wowed"" me, and I was very disappointed with general form. It was very hard to follow the logic of most of the essays, and I read them multiple times to give them the benefit of the doubt. I felt like a scrooge in scoring, but if it simply isn't understandable...... I'm curious to see what my scores are, now that I've seen others' essays.....I think people are struggling with the concept of a single, contained thesis. People are biting off too much topic and struggling to do anything with it....;I think you have a great point, Florencia - it's important to separate form from content.

Now - I enjoyed the novel (a lot, really...), so this isn't coming from a position of sour grapes.... but: it seems to me that Stoker takes every opportunity for Mina's intelligence and strength to be surprising, or unusual... and the male party members all seem to *need* to see her as something to be protected.

And it is interesting that in the end Mina ceases these activities, even though in the course of the novel she many times states that she enjoys those intellectual and professional activities....  I, too, gave up with the ""sweet, sweet"" tally. It's there that I think Mina really gets short-shrifted. She may be vital to the story (We must clear the stain on her forehead, Rah!), but she is more an object than otherwise.

Unless I'm reading a graphic novel, I'd rather keep the pictures to a minimum.

Then he tosses in the occasional news article to give you a sense of what's happening in the outside world - stuff the individual ""narrators"" may not know or realistically mention in their diaries.I love this format in Dracula; it makes the novel feel very real to me.;I've always been partial to the Reader Response method of criticism:  Reader-response criticism  is a school of  literary theory  that focuses on  the reader  (or ""audience"") and his or her experience of a  literary work, in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author or the content and  form  of the work.Although literary theory has long paid some attention to the reader's role in creating the meaning and experience of a literary work, modern reader-response criticism began in the 1960s and '70s, particularly in America and Germany, in work by  Norman Holland,  Stanley Fish,  Wolfgang Iser,  Hans-Robert Jauss,  Roland Barthes, and others. Important predecessors were  I. A. Richards, who in 1929 analyzed a group of  Cambridge  undergraduates' misreadings;  Louise Rosenblatt, who, in  Literature as Exploration  (1938), argued that it is important for the teacher to avoid imposing any ""preconceived notions about the proper way to react to any work""; and  C. S. Lewis  in  An Experiment in Criticism(1961).Reader-response theory recognizes the reader as an active agent who imparts ""real existence"" to the work and completes its meaning through interpretation. Reader-response criticism argues that literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates his or her own, possibly unique, text-related performance. It stands in total opposition to the theories of  formalism  and the  New Criticism, in which the reader's role in re-creating literary works is ignored. New Criticism had emphasized that only that which is within a text is part of the meaning of a text. No appeal to the authority or  intention of the author, nor to the  psychology  of the reader, was allowed in the discussions of orthodox New Critics.from  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism;I enjoyed the book, a lot - but did anyone notice that not ten minutes after the group discussed that Dracula can take the form of a bat, Quincy took a shot at a bat that had been sitting on the windowsill? (Mina Harker's Journal, September 30, chapter 17) And no one made the connection?And how did no one notice that Mina then suddenly began having symptoms suspiciously akin to Lucy's?I admit I read with a 21st century perspective, but sheesh!

I think these novels still have much worth, though - they may not meet our modern sensibilities, but they are powerful in their own way.  I had read Dracula before, and recently read some Dickens and his contemporaries, so perhaps that made this read easier for me. I think it would be more difficult to really enjoy Dracula within the context of this class given the tight time frame. In college, when I first had to read Dickens, I absolutely hated him. Now, when I get to read at my leisure, I find  Dickens wonderfully rewarding... some novels are best savored rather than consumed.  So Dracula was an okay read for me, and I enjoyed it.

I found I was working too hard and didn't feel like I'd said anything.I'm guessing that trying something innovative when you'll be peer-reviewed is dangerous business.

Pages are filled with his anguish and moping, and holy cow - get a grip! Did it occur to Frankenstein to wonder about the being? To search for something other than easy revulsion? Did he contemplate the life he sparked, then abandoned? Memory may not serve me right, but I believe he wasn't overly concerned until consequences began knocking at his door.The being I have more sympathy for. Yes, he is vengeful, and willing to murder the innocent, but he, at least, has the lack of parenting to partially blame for it (Would I have grown differently if every contact I had with others was negative, dangerous, and hurtful? What if I'd had to learn of society from a lean-to in a ditch? Would I be angry if I knew I was doomed to a life of utter solitude, to never have a companion to share my thoughts with?

It's that kind of thing that made Victor especially problematic for me. He is supposed to be very brilliant, but he fails to see the obvious. I chalk this up to less-than-adept authorship.  Shelly should have stuck to the short story structure and resisted her husband's urging to expand this into a novel.  ;I, too found The Birthmark mesmerizing. I loved that story.

Or was this a chortle of revenge (so to speak), because the alchemist had destroyed her due to his own obsessive ambition.... Did he (the assistant) know all along that without the birthmark there could be no woman?Just things bouncing in my head.;"

I'm guessing that video will answer the questions.;London, UK, added! :);I think it's very interesting how these folkloric and therefore, communal, products can turn into individual pleasures. The effect of a fairy tale is personal, but the tradition is passed through the years by all of us. And in that sense, it's plural as well.  ;I think crouched in a lot of fairy tales are guides or values that are important or believed by a certain society.   Many are morality tales that are meant to impart some knowledge or wisdom about human interactions, fears, and/or dreams.;Fairy tales have familiar and fairly rigid structures, and humans like recognizable patterns.   Think of the patterns of three: if a story has three sons, you know the first two are going to make the same mistake, and the third one will figure out how to avoid it.   That's a pattern as regular and familiar as the knock-knock joke.   And there's some evidence that pattern recognition is tied to the release of dopamine in the brain, which is what makes old familiar things so pleasurable.Of course, subverting a familiar pattern by adding *unexpected* rewards gives an even greater rush of dopamine.   I imagine this is why retellings of fairy tales are so popular at the moment. :);Hi Larissa, do you know of any online versions that have that introduction?Thanks;And yet, so many of the Tales seem surreal, a string of bizarre incidents laid out with little in the way of pattern, just as they were told to the Grimms. There is something primal about them rather than patterned after social mores, something of them that screams, ""We are not to be read in the context of THIS world but another. Throw away your logic and the safety of what you know. This is about a world in which adhering to social norms does you no good - this is the Otherworld, in which the rules are very different."";Cheri, I too, was so glad they were over. I felt much as I did as a freshman in college having to read Hemingway's Nick Adams Stories - Oh God, another story about fish; I'm going to hurl this book against the wall!I read the first part of the tales at a more leisurely rate, but the last half in a couple of days. I found myself rolling my eyes and thinking, another evil step mother, another person doing what I consider the wrong thing and getting away with it, etc. etc. I echo your questions:  ""what is it about these tales that has made them so important? To what human experience do they speak?"" I too am flabbergasted (I loved the use of that word because it describes my feelings exactly) and I am looking forward to some light being shed on the matter.;This is fun.  So people keep saying (not necessarily on this post, but in the world at large...) that these are stories to teach morality. What!?! Tom Thumb... in both of the Crane stories, Tom Thumb dupes people - he's a liar! - and ends up just fine in the end. Others suffer significant losses (and they aren't always bad people, either... Tom Thumb just doesn't care. He's chaos in a miniature....).  And in The Little Farmer, well... that rascal becomes king in the end - by thievery, trickery, and murder (if you count convincing others to roll themselves into the river inside hole-riddled barrels as murder......)! How is that morality? Maybe the moral is that stupid people deserve to lose their fortunes (and their lives), even if their ends are brought about through deceit....I could continue my rant - if you're pretty you win, if you're ugly you're evil, dad's are utterly useless (they never seem to stand up to stepmothers...)...Maybe they speak to the darkness of life in the time of these stories' creation? Are they lessons that success does not necessarily go to the good, merely the more clever?  Anahita: I could see a childhood memory of these stories being told by a person (especially a family elder!) making them nostalgic and wonderful. That's how these stories were once passed down. Anything told within the human context of a storyteller would be richer. I guess for me, the text version is just... blah. My guess is that in Real Life, these stories were altered by the teller to teach some particular moral or illustrate some sort of point...

Elderly women from the groom's side would go in to see the bride, but the poor boy and girl wouldn't see each other. Because of this, stories around the switch were common. One that was later made into a movie, which is a favorite of mine, pictures a switch where the girl's young lover takes the bride's place, who was to be married to an older man. (Little note: The bride was delivered to the grooms house totally covered up, so with a bit of cunning, anyone could take her place and no one would notice.)  ;Hi Kenneth,I don't think summarizing is intended. I think we aim for enriching other students' reading by writing about what insights we gain from reading the collection. It could be something on writing, or themes, or impact, or anything that immersing into the collection reveals to us. Maybe it's a categorization of themes, maybe it's a comparison, maybe it's an overall impression. Options are countless, as our brains will focus on different aspects as individuals, and by sharing it, we will hugely enhance our collective learning.I hope this helps.Thanks;Over the years of reading stories, I have encountered only one fairy tale, (it was a clever tale of talking foxes and an enchanted princess, from Realms of Fantasy,) that was written in the modern time. I have seen many retold and modernized fairy tales, but newly bred, fairy tales that felt like my grandma told them to me, it was only that one. Have I missed them, or are they rare? Is this sub-genre breeding, or is it a cherished legacy of less complex times?;Hi Cheri,As for how I define it, I didn't quite mean what is called modern fairy tales, with its complex viewpoints and sometimes political humor. I meant stories that have that grandma at bedtime feel to them. I agree it's hard to define it in exact words.Thanks;Hi Carolina,I agree. In a way, fairy tales seems to build simple building blocks, one dimensional characters that can serve as basis vectors to build the more complex space of modern stories. And for that matter among others, I think they will last. But what about adding new basis vectors? Have all of them been already done?Thanks;Hi Lucia,Yes, exactly, that's what I suspect I see too. They have changed form. And I'm afraid this change is more dramatic than the change we see in let's say horror genre, or mystery genre, or romance genre for that matter. I have read very old romance stories that pull on the very same strings that modern stories in the genre do. It doesn't seem to be the case in fairy tales.Thanks;Hi Kimaya,Very good point. Child care methods and philosophies have changed dramatically. Instilling fear and obedience are not among the things I want my stories to deliver to them. Inspiration, dreaming big and going for it are. And yet, I see great potential for our very own homemade fairy tales to deliver these values. So, could the genre stay  alive and be used still at bedtimes, new tales, new values for new societies, but the same bare and non-complex structure?  Here's a book I came upon (I have not read it) where a Freudian psychologist explores the use of fairy tales for children.http://www.amazon.com/Uses-Enchantment-Meaning-Importance-ebook/dp/B004FGMPHG/ref=la_B001IODKGS_1_1?...Very good point. Thanks.;Thanks for the information, Elle.  ;Hi Crystal,Have you tried the public library? They should have them, and if not, they can always bring them for you through inter-library loan (I'm not sure if you are in U.S. or not) but in any case, a public library or a university library near you should have them for free usage. Good luck!;That is a good question. There is this issue that the emotional impact of story on the reader is among the most important aspects of it as a book, and while reading, we only have our own emotions to watch and report. So from that aspect, I think it is valid. A deeper validation would be perhaps using the discussion forums to get a vote from other students on the type of emotion being delivered, making it a more scientific approach.  ;I think, yes, you may. I for one, find the personal experiences of readers very valuable insight. It's what I cannot access with just myself as reference. It would definitely enrich my reading, and I would definitely appreciate your sharing.Thanks;Aschenputtel (Cinderella) and some other fairy tales have middle eastern versions, different names, slightly different setting and plots, but essentially the same stories. Did they develop independently or did travel and trade spread them throughout the globe?If they developed independently, does that mean the human culture was more uniformly developed a long time ago? Is the culture more heterogeneous now than before?  ;Thanks everyone, for the insight into this.;I feel this intense effect after finishing the tales, an effect that I cannot quite put in words. I guess immersing that intensely in anything is bound to generate new brain networks, or change the existing ones. The feeling is of these tales having touched me on a deep subconscious level. But on the surface I cannot word the effect that I feel.  Naming emotions has always been my weakness.  Can you put it in words if they changed your brain, and how?;Hi Michelle, I agree. Also as a writer, I found it easier with these tales to watch for when and how the emotion is evoked in the reader. I think it may be because of the simplicity of the strings they pull at. But the simplicity does not prevent us from combining the effects into more complex cases. It just makes the analyzing of them easier. It was a great experience from that aspect.;Hi Greg,I find the simplicity of characters a useful learning tool, if one is into writing fiction. These one dimensional characters, in my view, make the building blocks, basis vectors if you will, of the space of human motivations. This way, they are easy to analyze and understand, and also easy to combine, to make more complex multidimensional beings.Thanks;Hi Katy,I found the experience of writing very different from what I had thought. While reading, I had noticed something that I wanted to share and decided it would be my essay, and that I would just write it and be done with it. But when I actually sat down to write, it made me review the entire reading in my mind and it brought some of the aspects I had learned on a subconscious level to a conscious knowing. The writing became an integral part of my learning, without it the impact would be much less. So, now, I am looking forward to the next essay and the door it will open to me.Marvelous experience.

I was going to ask that question. But, with your permission, I will ask that one in a separate thread. In connection with this thread, though, you said you did not care for Alice herself. Would you say it was the world-building that made you love the book, or was it something else?Thanks;I totally agree. Word-play was definitely lost in the translations that I had read. However, I fancy even more was lost. I somehow had never gotten the feel of the atmosphere Carroll is drawing here. But, then again, the entire world is built through that word-play. And, now that I think about it, even the hook for me was the word-play (Alice talking to herself.) How amazing! I think you pinpointed the answer to the other two threads that I had started. I think I got my answer for all of them: The word-play. Thanks.;Hi Megan,  Now that I have finished reading this unit, I wanted to add a small note.   I begin to really see what this course is about. It is helping me grasp what makes these masterpieces, masterpieces. And the beautiful answer this course is leading me to: that the answer is not entirely inside the text itself, but in the impact these works have had on human culture. It became crystal clear to me, once really grasping Alice, that one could not possibly remain the same after reading it, and that in fact, going back to history, one did not remain the same. Fiction   s contribution is a concept I   m seeing in a totally different light with the aid of this course.   Human mind, modern world, this course it every single bit, what its title promises.

As for kids and adults, I believe the dreamy world appeals to kids but the deeper message is for adults.  ;Hi William,Thank you so much, for the clarity of your response about the place where you were hooked. It's very helpful. And I agree about the 'who am I question, too.'Thanks.;Being originally from a part of the world where English was not the first language, I had come upon many translations of Alice in Wonderland. Later in here, I watched movies, and other renditions of it. And having never really encountered the original text, I deemed the book 'boring.' It is so NOT boring. I can't wait to return to Wonderland when I put it down.  So, is it untranslatable? And even in English language, what is it about the book that seems so totally lost in movies and other renditions?;I agree, Megan. I think that's the reason. I remember reading a translation of Voltaire's Candid and wondering why it was so famous, and where was the humor, until I read the French original and absolutely fell in love with it. Carroll is definitely in that category, as far as translations go.  Thanks;Thanks for the insight into Russian language, Olena.

But the reality, perhaps, is that a strong image can bear many meanings.

So wonderful.;This essay is on Rappaccini   s Daughter and the possible themes which can render different readings of the story. The image of a    poisonous human,    with its dimensions of science and humanity, is a powerful and timeless one, making various readings possible.Reading one--Battle against science: yet another tale of pursuit of science gone awry because of man   s disconnection from human concerns. Professor Baglioni   s final words, denouncing Rappaccini   s research, support this reading.   Reading two--Battle of sexes: Misery brought upon women by men. Beatrice   s father, her lover, and the professor, are all men. And although she had the poison weapon, as her father put it, so no one could do her wrong, everyone did. The final image of her falling to the ground at their feet resonates with this reading.Reading three--Battle of men over ownership of women: the human root of the father   s reluctance to part with her daughter, his plan of keeping her away from the world, and then fashioning a bridegroom for her support this reading.Reading four--Battle of generations: The older generation destroying the younger generation with their good wishes of living their lives for them. This appears not only in the relation between Rappaccini and her daughter, but also in the words of Baglioni to Giovanni, that he would not let the son of his friend fall prey to Rappaccini.Reading five--Battle of love against religious beliefs: Giovanni is torn between his love for Beatrice and the religious beliefs that tell him if her breath extinguishes life (monstrosity of physique,) then her soul too should be monstrous, the beliefs that lead him to contribute to her demise with his harsh words.More readings are possible.

These tales were around for a long time, as folktales, as warning tales, etc. The Grimms were simply the ones who wrote them down in a collection to be published and studied many years later. A.S. Byatt, in the introduction to my version points out that ""the Grimms' narrative style moves from the impersonal oral to the 'authored' story with psychology."" Meaning, they started just writing down the tales that were told to them, but at some point, they began to change little details of the story for better flow and other reasons. Like myths, there were also often many different versions of the tales, too.;As for the title of the post, I don't think it has. Science Fiction is every bit as awesome as it's ever been - but we progress in actual science so quickly that it's hit a sort of literary uncanny valley. In the 1950's, the projections of future technology had a lot more wiggle room than they do now, since we have the technology (and even better, often) nearly as soon as the story's been read.Also, in the 1950's-1960's and some of the 1970's, we had a very strong Space program, and inherently more reason to look forward. I feel like we need to be actually exploring new territory in order to do it in our fantasy. ;I certainly see what you mean about the uncanny valley.  I sketch a lot, and most of my drawings include mythical and fantasy characters and creatures. Consequently, I end up looking up and studying other people's work for the sake of self-improvement. I find that if I ever do too much of this research in one day (more than 20 concepts), my own imagination freezes up, rendering me unable to draw anything new, anything I hadn't already seen before.  There is an infinite number of ways a green dragon can be drawn, but few differences in those green dragons.  Perhaps, because sci-fi is now all around us, we (both creators and consumers of sci-fi) have hit the same sort of saturation point? It hasn't necessarily lost its awesome, but rather hit a point where all new ideas seem pretty much the same.  I hope I haven't gone off topic or misunderstood your point, Casey.  ;WOW! I love your post. It really got me thinking. Your right once you have been so saturated with a topic it is hard to come up with anything new. I'm a young adult science fiction writer and coming up with some completely new is very hard because so much has been done already. Sometime it feels like I'm just rewriting the something in different words. That's when I have to stop and make an adjustment to what I'm doing.; So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science  Wow, that is an excellent observation! But I wonder where the line is drawn (or if it can be drawn) between these two? A little bit of science in fiction can help to suspend your disbelief and drawn you into the world a bit more, but fictional science can be more fun and escapist. I'd hate for a book to be a slave to either end of the spectrum, but I do like a little bit of science fact in my SF and, done right, I don't think it gets in the way of the fun and escapism. One technique I enjoy in SF books is taking the technology of today (or maybe a few years from now) and exploring the ramifications of it. For example, Halting State by Charles Stross looks at online roleplaying games a few years from now and how they are being used by criminals. The technology in that book feels like it could exist within the next five years and supports the plot without getting in the way. ;The awesome of this topic is filling me with nerd fire. I'm not entirely sure how to quote other posters on this forum so I'll try my best to not mangle too badly. Firstly, Casey you're right. Sci-fi has become a derivative of itself, but only because it's the natural evolution of a genre that has been around as long as it has. And the spawning of sub-genres is what iteratively brings us back to the Hard v. Soft Sci-fi as Pradyumn observed.  But I think what Gar said points to an even more astounding possibility, one I've thought of exploring for a while now. That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.  ;Theo, I'd wager you're better versed than I am in Sci-fi lore at this point, as I have yet to make the acquaintance of the good Doctor. I've just had a little more time to distil my thoughts on the matter. But I concur that using theoretical science as a means to explain fantastical elements is simply the next progression in the evolution of Sci-fi. Just taking the Grimm Bro's stories and thinking how the Dr. would explain talking animals, would bring in whole new elements of fantasy and Sci-fi as a duo instead of opposing forces.;I am with you Casey. I also disagree that in the more to learn section just tossed all comic books aside. All comic books are not super heroes. Even novels such as Ender's Game ( one of my favorite novels of all time) has been adapted into comic book form. Popular SF franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars have ongoing comics.... And I would definitely would argue comics such as Swamp Thing, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (that's right, they were comic books before they were movies) may beg to differ, but that's just me and my opinion. ;My belief about science fiction is that we have evolved from stories about the glorious, technologically advanced future, to what happens when all that goes wrong. My new favorite books and stories are dystopian novels, such as Brave New World, and that have had new young life breathed into them, thanks to the success of series like The Hunger Games. There is a plethora of dystopian series out there now, such as my favorite, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and others, such as Delirium by Lauren Oliver, Partials by Dan Wells,   The Maze Runner by James Dashner, and Across the Universe by Beth Revis (which is more of a pure sci-fi leaning than the others). I don't think sci-fi has ""lost its awesome""; I just think it has evolved and changed over time.  ;Possimpable! Love it! lolBut are dreams not fantasy's in themselves ...;SF as a whole is some sort of fantasy on its own, but I meant dreams more as a metaphor for ""humanity wishing for this or that"", not precisely dreaming while sleeping. Gibson ""dreamt"" of the cyberspace and built it up in his Sprawl Trilogy as well as his distopian corporate-controlled society where slums are the places where more ""freedom"" is possible.Humanity ""dreamt"" of traveling to the Moon as well as through time. Those dreams have fueled SF and as Casey stated: we need more problems to be fixed and IMHO the fast-progress technology and science that exist nowadays should create some kind of a new ""era"" or at least ""trends"" in the SF genre.What are your thoughts?;Maybe I am a little bit off topic with this but anyway... Have you read Argentinian or Latinoamerican sf? Because there you'll find a lot of awesomeness that it's missing in Anglo sf. Of course, there's not much techno-awesomeness in it but there a lot of focus in what could be called social, anthropological or metaphysical science fiction, plus a lot of humor and ""uncorrectness"" (in form and in language).If you are interested (and can read in Spanish, of course), I recommend you to go to Axxon, the greatest and oldest sf magazine of Argentina (24 years old and it was always digital, it was first distributed in floppy disks and then online).

Point well made, and taken.And Cheri just simplified what I was trying to say. Thanks.Going back to Casey's point, the part ""if done well enough"" is what's bugging me.

Star Trek gives the science and renders a mystery ascertainable while The Lion, the  Witch...  retains the mystery, offering no explanation, relying on our acceptance of the created world working according to its own rules. In Fantasy we accept the rules of the new world and maybe just judge based on how consistent the rules  are in their application. In Sci Fi there is an expectation that the explanation has some anchor in reality, some point of  connection to the  world we know. There is a plausible line of extrapolation from the real to the  scientific fiction.  A sense of awe is evoked when a particular reader is gobsmacked and enthralled by the story presented, where his mind finds the spark of childhood wonderings. An unexposed person, like any unknowing child, may be awed by newness, the strange or the unexpectedly unique in any of the elements of Literature: plot, character, setting, conflict, dialogue, style, diction or narrative technique once the new element finds some resonance. The source of awe can be from any of the elements of a novel, play or poem.Has Sci-Fi lost its awesomeness? It depends on the exposure of the person reading it. Someone new to Sci Fi may still be impressed, but for someone steeped in the genre, it will take a paradigmatic shift or, as per the Penn Jilllette comment, a masterful presentation to create the sense of spectacle.Unless technology gives us something new to consider, or, some innovative writer finds a unique idea linked to our current reality but so strange it sets the mind a wagging, then, for the seasoned Sci/Fi consumer, Sci/Fi would have lost its awesomeness.Loss of awesomeness? Depends on who is reading and their exposure and the who is writing and their content.  Because of the monochromatic nature of Sci/Fi content  arising from  the monopoly of ideas created by Hollywood and the resultant variations on the     themes, to the exposed consumer, there may be less awesomeness. Maybe the surfeited reader of Sci/Fi needs to take a break and fast a little from the genre. Give it some time to become unfamiliar. Then, maybe it would still offer some awesome in its current forms.;While there is nothing excluding them from falling with in fantasy or scifi, in of themselves I would say they belong to the larger Speculative Fiction category rather than belonging specifically as Fantasy or SciFi.;Interesting! I always felt like Omelas was a classic dystopia, because of the horrible reason that it is so great there. I still tear up when I read the line that is something like - 'it's because of the child that they are so gentle with children'. Anyway, it's interesting to think of it as a utopia, because then you have to accept that any utopia would have some cost or collateral damage; and that human nature may not allow for a pure utopia at all. ;I kind of like how the first one has the words ""Came"" and ""Went"" so much larger than the others.

The idea of straw or coal choosing independently to make a bridge of itself and then dying is outside the bounds of a more literal application of reality to writing as is a myriad of other happenings within the realm of the fairy tale. What I have learned from fairy tales then is that ALL things can be made to do ANYTHING when imagination has been applied sufficiently. I think that's a bit closer to how I saw the world as a child, how many of us may have seen the world in youth. Through fairy tales, an adult can reorient their mind to a time when they hadn't compartmentalized the universe into ""this does this"" and ""that does that"". It's like being able to access a new brain, but it's really just an older, dynamic one that somewhere along the line got put to the side. Anyway... yeah... lol.  ;Hi Vignesh! Thanks for including your essay for review (it's good people are doing this; I think it will help to get us into the proper mindset for when we submit on time in the future). I'll try to approximate the normal grading structure, similar to Samantha above --  Form 2 - The writing is acceptable, flowing from one topic to the next in what feels to be a sensible fashion. That having been said, there are certain levels of evidence lacking to lend your assertions strength which, had they been present, would have given a better control of the flow. Keep an eye on your capitalization when you are converting nouns into proper nouns (ie. Coal of anger should be Coal of Anger as it exemplifies the concept).Content 2 - While I don't think I completely agree with the symbols you interpret from the text, I do think that what you've presented here is enough to make me interested in learning ""why"" you interpret the images as you have. Hooking me with your content is almost as important as making me believe it, so congrats. I also think that ascribing those interpretations raises worthwhile questions for us as an audience.Overall, I would like to have seen more from the essay. Your premise is good, but lacks the support necessary to sway your audience as effectively as one would hope. As a suggestion, one trick for making the essay a little longer and helping to lend strength to your argument would be to highlight text that shows why you are labeling an element from the story as particularly symbolic. I think you did well and I hope to see more of your work in the future!;Hi Andres! Thanks for sharing your essay with us :) I won't belabor the point of getting an additional set of eyes to look over your drafts as everyone has mentioned that already. As far as subject goes, I think you're observations concerning vice and virtue are correct. It seems like many of the fables we enjoy (and see represented in this book) have something to teach us concerning conduct that is rewarded or punished. My only real critique on your chosen theme is that, while your audience is likely to agree with and appreciate your findings, it's not a point that we have to stretch ourselves to understand. Feel free to expound an idea that is a bit off the wall (as long as you can support it). We are scifi and fantasy fans, after all -- we like unconventional :P I think you did great on the first essay and I hope we get a chance to see more from you. Cheers!;Hi Martha :) You were kind enough to comment on a number of other people's essays (including my own), so I'll try to return the favor. Hopefully, not ineptly, lol.I like your writing here, I think you do a great job of separating your points and tying them back to the original thesis. One way that you could strengthen the essay is to add more transitioning material at the closing of paragraphs so that you move between points with increased ease. As far as content goes, you pull from a lot of sources, laying a good foundation for your points. I think some of your prongs could actually stand alone well as their own essays and would have enjoyed seeing the ""We see in... unequal relationship"" paragraph restructured and expanded upon to be its own essay. Nice topic, writing, and content :)  Thanks for sharing your essay with us! It was enjoyable to read and I hope to see more of your writing!;Well... this is disheartening... I had remembered my due dates incorrectly. At least I am in good company and it is okay to miss an assignment! I suppose I can go ahead and post what I'd intended to submit tomorrow night (as I had thought incorrectly Thursday was the due date for our initial responses). Though it's not eloquent, I hope you find it useful for something (even if it's just hysterics):In    The Death of the Hen   , many objects and animals are engendered with anthropomorphic qualities by the authors. Given the recurrent use of the writing tool, it is of interest to the reader that within the text exists two separate brooks, one which is ascribed the qualities of human desire   (coveting silk in exchange for water) and the other which is never noted to have human characteristic at all. As the reader compares the culpability of the first brook in the death of the hen versus the second brook in the death of all the other woodland animals (and, arguably, a piece of straw and gleed of coal), one realizes that the tale is built in a manner which creates a space in which the audience itself may reflect on their own values regarding accountability.  The text confronts its reader with a question:  Which is more at fault for death and destruction     the force which chooses or that which acts without choice?  Inanimate objects provide causes for death such as the nut which chokes the hen and the brook which drowns the mourners. However, it is the choice of the hen which causes her to eat a nut too large for herself, the choices of the brook and the bride which forces the cock to take too long in getting back to her with water, and the choice to follow the cock in a funeral procession which leads the grieving animals to follow the deceased hen to her fate.  Ultimately, the story appears to identify    the force which chooses    as being the primary party responsible for death and destruction as at the end the cock himself laments so sorely that he himself dies at the mound, but one is left to wonder if the authors have also proven that the emotions which compelled all of the choices leading to so many tragedies is itself an act which occurs without choice. And, if so, is life itself at once a collision of choice and action where the two forces are themselves inextricable from one another?;Thanks, Martha, for your critique! To be honest, I think I'd have to weigh against using a question at the end of an essay (even though I did it here). Had I gone back through to revise it, I believe I'd have blended the question with the last sentence or simply jettisoned it altogether. Since I was already late though and was on the verge of being late for the midnight deadline in this very thread, I decided that the essay would stand as is.

In Will Self's The Book of Dave, the titular character is basically the quick guide to casual misogyny, homophobia and racism. Does that necessarily display any quality that the writer has? I don't think so.  Whilst there are some writers that it is DEFINITELY a reflection on, can this be fully extrapolated? I mean, theoretically I can write a story about say...a man who hates women. Indeed, I did write a...very disturbing story of a male porter sexually assaulting a catatonic woman in a psychiatric ward. Is the very fact that I wrote it and he didn't get away with it mean that I think it was a perfectly acceptable behaviour or does it mean something else.There are a lot of shades of grey to consider with this sort of thing but I know I've read quite a number of books that i have had to stop reading and return to after kicking a door or calming down.;Apparently we don't need to do ALL the essays in order to pass but I wonder if this will mean that there may be a bit of a change to how clear it is when and where these will be submitted for the rest of the classes...I'm in the same boat.

Whilst as a psychologist, I am a bit iffy about using the word 'psyche' as it's a bit wishy-washy, I think there is a good basis here. However, I felt like some of the conclusions felt   a bit unsupported.  It does seem to be a story about grief and bereavement but you could afford a little more explanation since you're just over the lower word count.  Structurally speaking, you have a clear intro, middle and conclusion. I didn't like the ""there once was a pair of brothers"" thing at first but it's grown on me as I've written this! But the middle seems a bit muddled.    If you changed the order - you should have the description of the hen, the cock,the brook and the like before the other animals crossing the brook. It would make it flow better.I'd personally separate the three with a new paragraph them out for clarity.Overall, I think it's a pretty good essay but I hope I've made it clear where to improve. It's been pretty informative but you could explain a touch more and make it flow a bit better. However, that said, it's not a bad attempt and it would take incredibly little editing to make it brilliant.;This is my essay...In the Grimm   s Fairy tales, there is a continuing emphasis on cloth. It is my hypothesis that it   s a running metaphor. In Greek mythology, thread was the symbol of life used by The Three Fates (Perhaps the source of The Three Spinsters). Thus, fate and thread are entwined.   In Snow White, the Queen cuts herself embroidering and wishes for pregnancy and it is fulfilled. In Mother Hulda, the spindle falls and the girl must retrieve it and this is clearly a near-death experience parable     the good are rewarded and the bad are punished. In the Sleeping Beauty, even when the spindles were burnt, Fate could not be stopped. Clothing is used to either attempt to change Fate (e.g. The Six Swans) or to ensure it (e.g. The Goose Girl). In all of these, clothing is used as a way to hide the true nature of a person but it always fails. The only story that does not follow this is The Rabbit Bride as clothing successfully changed Fate. However, considering the    unnatural    arrangement of the wedding, exemplified by the crow and fox, Fate could be changed.   Generally, only three types of people change Fate: tailors, spinsters and Rumplestiltskin. In    The Gallant Tailor   , he caused his own fate through embroidery. In The Table, the Ass and the Stick, the magic gifts are related to parts of life but without the cloth accompanying them, these are meaningless. In the Straw, the Coal and the Bean, they all fail to escape their Fate until a tailor saved the bean. In Rumplestiltskin, alchemic and unnatural spinning and changing of Fate had a price       life itself.   Fate cannot be altered unless they are a master of the art     and in this context of Fate, this would be in terms of gods and demons and thus attempts to change it by mortals are doomed to fail.;I think you've got something here. There is definitely a dichotomy between vice and virtue within the tales. But if I am being honest, there are some spelling and punctuation errors. Your grammar is generally okay (a few minor errors) but there is need for improvement. For the next assignment, I would get someone to beta or proof-read your response so that those errors do not impede your overall mark. I could highlight the errors that you had but I wouldn't wish to impose on you or anything considering I think you're doing a pretty damn good job in writing an essay in a non-native language! However, if you wish me to, I'd be happy to oblige.  You do bring up a good point though and I think your essay has promise. I do think you would need to delve a little deeper though. It might be an obvious conclusion to arrive to so I think you could go into more social/religious/political sides of it. Why would people tell children these tales especially when some of these had far more adult beginnings in the oral tradition. Of course that might be too general for the essay in question so it definitely is tricky!One thing though, the conclusion doesn't seem to follow from the rest of the story. It feels like there is two different ideas - of vice and virtue in the stories and the alterations between oral and written traditions and the transitional nature of the stories over time. It was a nice conclusion, don't get me wrong, but didn't reflect on the rest of the essay. jsut something for next time.You have good ideas but you need to ensure that you keep to one idea. I'm not taking spelling and punctuation in this instance to be a huge detriment but I would get someone to have a look over it before you hand things in.;This essay is pretty well done! It has a clear idea, is well argued and relatively well structured. Femininity and beauty are such discussed aspects of the Grimm's Tales that it's one of the most common things spoke about it. As such, to ensure that the essay covers all the available points, there are many factors and levels that are going on. I think you have covered most of them but since you concentrated on feminine beauty, there was little discussion of female characters who did not fit into this. You did discuss beautiful person/horrid personality but there was nothing really about outside that... However, I fully understand that space is a huge factor (honestly, beauty in the Grimm's Tales could easy hit a few thousand words without any of it being irrelevant) and thus it's not a huge criticism but it's wise to acknowledge it further as it could be used as counter examples.  As for the structure, it's very well done aside from the conclusion. I feel it's a bit lacking but I could be biased since I've been told for years that my conclusions have been pitifully short. What is the thing you need to go over is word count. You only went over by two little words but I'd just keep an eye on it since it could become a problem with a more stringent marker?Overall, I think this was a tip-tip essay but you need to watch out for counter-examples and to make sure that you're within the word limit. They're not big issues at all though.;Aha, I wasn't aware of this! What a neat system! Usually these systems would accept anything and thus the word count thing was up to the marker...although in my last classes, they would stop reading after the permitted word count so...;Good essay attempt! It's an interesting look at the power dynamics - that social movement is only really permitted when the upper hand is perceived as being unfair or bad. It's the David and Goliath effect, essentially.However, there was a few characters like the fisherman and his wife or the sausage, the mouse and the bird who weren't particularly bad people. The Fisherman thing is more reminiscent of Macbeth - too ambitious - and the sausage/mouse/bird thing is more about those easily led. Of course those are my own interpretation but they do go along similar lines as such, I'm unsure about how these would fit into your essay.Structurally, this is very good but...there really isn't any firm conclusion which is a damn shame. The final paragraph is beautifully written, don't get me wrong, but it's not a conclusion, it's still part of your main body of the essay. Considering that you're over the limit, I would look into pruning words were possible to retain a low word count and giving yourself a full essay.  Overall, it's a very good essay but without that conclusion, it lets it down and you're clearly capable of completing it since the rest of the essay is to a high standard.;It's a good attempt as you have taken a slightly more technical approach i.e. concentrating on realism. You're right in that even ignoring the more fantastical elements such as witchcraft and giants, there are some things that are highly exaggerated. But, there is a problem in that you don't especially give us examples of exaggeration. The man sleeping during the race isn't exaggerated, it's just downright idiotic (although the race itself is pretty damn exaggerated). Anthropomorphism again isn't really exaggerating, it's giving a power to an animal, like I wouldn't call giving a human character X-Ray vision is exaggeration, just fantasising, which may be kissing cousins with exaggeration but but innately so. Additionally, I'm a little uncertain as to why you called the tales 'antagonistic'. They're certainly a bit schizophrenic concerning child and adultness (which when you consider the overtly sexual and violent nature of the very original oral traditions of the tales, it doesn't really surprise me.) It is possible that I have misunderstood you.As for structure, it was a little hard to keep up with all the issues. Perhaps because this was under the word limit (by a significant bit), you could expand on your major points a touch to make it flow a little bit better? There's a bit of an conclusion but it would need to be extended to make it really work for you considering how good your introduction was in comparison.  Overall, it's not a bad essay. It brought up some points that I didn't especially think about when reading which is pretty good but essentially you need to flesh it out a touch more to make it flow better and to give it a solid conclusion.;I think you have a rather good interpretation of the story. There are issues with the divide between what the reader knows of the tailor and what everyone else does. The tailor does seem to be cunning and sometimes only survives out of sheer dumb luck (which is how he started this whole mess in the first place!). However, I do think that you can expand quite a bit on it. After all, is there not a juxtaposition between the pride he initially felt for killing the seven flies that is quickly put aside? There could be debate between the trickery that the tailor uses and the trickery other people use against him. Is either morally better and is this implied by this divide? Does he not think of himself as a cheat simply because his trickery is justified where others are not?The structure is there, there is a clear intro, main body and conclusion. But, like I have said before, we need more of it. As it stands, you're nearly a hundred words short of the lower word count which isn't good especially when you know yoru stuff and the rest of the essay is quite capable.  In conclusion, I'd say go a little deeper and go with it! You've got a good idea but you need to expand on it.;No problemo!And yeah. You probably were also being mindful of how short the essay was meant to be too so don't worry about it. :);We are all aware. It still does not detract from the issue that clarity is lacking in the website structure which caused this in the first place.   ;Psychoanalysis is nonsensical in terms of proper psychology but...this isn't strictly psychology. This isn't a science. In fact, I tell a lie.Are you familiar with qualitative analysis techniques? You know, constructionism, phenomenology and all that jazz? It is about the interpretation of speech and text. It cuts a fine line between speculation and interpretation and is knowingly subjective. Why those are used are made clear in their epistemologies, that gaining insights into those subjective worlds tells us a lot about groups and cultures that may surround certain aspects like into LGBT people or into disability...something that couldn't really be found in qualitative methodologies and can give novel insights into behaviours. These are subjective and interpretations are relative and thus not really falsifiable. it implies that there is no real truth to the world which is a perfectly valid philosophical stance to take.  How does apply to this? Well, it's literature. It will have as many interpretations as people who have read it. Many themes and interpretations may coincide and some may not. Quite frankly, the interpretation of literature is not a science and thus the restrictions of the scientific method a la Popper and Kuhn really do not apply. Psychoanalytic interpretations are interesting but in this academic field, the only evidence you need from this is...really from the text. Other sources such as time, criticism and all that good stuff are useful but...think about it this way. The text is your statistics. It's up to you how to interpret them (and you'll know that interpretation of those sweet, sweet numbers is almost as varied and subjective as interpreting literature).Ultimately, you don't need to agree with him in the slightest! I quite often didn't agree with my English lecturers   and so long as you can back it up from the text then they can't say a thing, dude.;...Because referencing something outside your own demographics has never been done? IDK, I fail to see how someone's religion means anything in terms of references. I can reference Christian, Hindu or whatever religious motifs you fancy, even though I am an atheist.  I think you need to get used to the idea that interpretation can go deeper than what the writers actually...err...wrote. Meaning is subjective, to speculate is to apply meaning with no text to back it up. Interpretation is to apply meaning with something to back it up.  This might seem radical but it's not about 'this is right' and 'this is wrong'. It's about arguing your case.  For a daft example. you could argue that Mother Hulda is a male fantasy about females 'beating' their 'bed' until 'white feathers' came out and they would be rewarded with gold, thus making it about prostitution and that lazy prostitutes get nothing and ones who get busy get their money. Of course it's not what I got out of it! However, it's not that difficult to apply any given meaning to any given thing so long as there is something in the text to back it up...Does this mean I am correct and my interpretation is the only one? No. Does this mean it's a good interpretation? No. It's more about how you do it over if it's right or not.;  I'm rather perplexed as to your concerns. This is not science and nobody is trying to make it like that. There's no truth where this is concerned as it is a exercise in determining what you got from a piece and why you came to such conclusions with evidence from the text and other sources. It is a world of grey, a world of could be and may be.I don't see why text will ultimately serve as a mirror of the writer's persona. There are a lot more factors to say why someone would write something than merely just their 'persona', just like personological factors like personality and intelligence will only have so much effect on a person's behaviour.  I can understand that as a psychologist, you're far more drawn to the author and analysing them than the text they have written. However, it is an impossible task (at least without a time machine). Looking into the literature can only give so much about the person. The story however is important to analyse as these stories influence other people and in reading them, they influence us. How they influence us is not in a 'magic bullet' model - there is no one interpretation that is fired into your head and you swallow it (regardless of what some theorists would speculate -cough- General Aggression Model -cough-). These different interpretations may hint towards the life and psychological make-up of the person or may just try to teach us something - try to teach us to be brave in the face of adversity or to not be a thief or that true love is possible. Additionally, they may just tell us much about that period of time, that society and the social conventions (and depending on how these are spoken about by the author, if they agree with them or not).  For example, look at the Harry Potter series. Trying to interpret a huge amount about JK Rowling's psychological welfare from those books is not a good idea (there is a link between dementors and depression but that's been specified by the author). What can be then interpreted? That cleverness and logic are very important? That bravery is good? That interpreting the world as good and bad is far too simplistic?With Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, there is something called double hermeneutics that plays a big role. It's building meaning on someone else's meaning - which is rather similar to the analysis of literature except it's a lot less structured and more vague. Although I get the feeling I have misinterpreted what you mean...I'm sorry that you find this problematic but you do know that you don't need to agree with the professor? You don't need to agree with any of his interpretations or his theories. He isn't intrinsically correct because he runs the class. So long as you can back up your interpretation with words from the text then you can interpret anything you like and fight back against interpretations that you think are codswallop so long as you can back it up with the text or with another source that disproves it (i.e. historical evidence and the like).;Don't worry, you're not exactly alone...There is a thread you can post your essay on to get feedback from others who didn't manage it. However, there is no grade I think. It's possible to miss a few of the essays and to be okay. I'm really unsure though. Stay in the class though.;If you look, there is a thread that those who didn't get it in on time for whatever reason but still wrote the essay can exchange feedback. It won't count towards our marks obviously but it can at least get a bit of feedback.;I know I'd still be interested in what you came up with! You should post it regardless and get a wee bit of feedback.;Actually, those theories are relatively old too...One of the only 'modern psychology theories' that could really apply (and that I recall) is the General Aggression Model (Anderson and Bushman, 2001). It implies that to witness violence is to replicate it - meaning that it was due to their general maltreatment that they eventually murdered the witch. Of course, it also implies that reading such tales fosters violent fantasies in people which is why they only 'deal out' the aggression needed.  Naturally, this is a highly limited theory (and one I despise with every fire of my being since it's riddled with error and misconception which is used on face value by the media and governments to demonise video game users). Any form of psychological theory will be very limited since we don't have any idea about biology or much about the environment, thus drawing any conclusion is going to be limited. I certainly disagree with the idea of Freudian analysis but then again, I'm relatively used to multiple theories being used in interpreting literature so it doesn't especially bother me. I'm used to the idea of my interpretations can be radically different from lecturers and it's fine.  I would fundamentally disagree with Piaget's childhood development being applicable in Hansel and Gretel. In Alice in Wonderland, yes...but Hansel and Gretel...not really.;This lovely little quote from the gryphon (Chapter Nine, AIW) kinda struck me on the head. There's a lot of mentions of growing up and the changes and the nonsense of adulthood that is discussed but this - to me - hit something poignant.Perhaps I am looking too deeply into this but perhaps it's a statement of personality, of the mind? Social roles dictate to us how to act in certain situations - you wouldn't act the same around your friends the way you would in, say, a job interview.  I'm unsure and this is just a gut response from reading the book however, do you think there is something to it? It's most likely tied into the adult world but I will need to finish reading to draw conclusions. I don't think I could limit myself to 300~ words on the whole AIW/adulthood thing but choosing simply the social selves and how different these could be could be something. Alice does change how she reacts to people and learns that saying certain things to say, the mouse, caused a great deal of offence, something she refrained from doing with the gryphon and the mock turtle.What do you think? Is this a worthwhile semi-hypothesis? Maybe I just like the quote since it makes me think of regenerations (-incomprehensible noises about Matt Smith).;You can miss two-three essays and still pass the course. They take your seven best essays as your grade. Just concentrate on the next assignment and don't let it bother you.;-spoilers, I guess-  Whilst I think some of Neville's development was a bit sudden, how in the name of Talos would Ginny or Ron be able to exchange letters? If Ginny went to Hogwarts alongside Neville and that, considering that it was essentially run by D;Well, one must take historical context into mind...since there was more than a few writers who were paid by the word!Aside from that, I do think you're not making a fair comparison between books. I mean, for goodness sake, the Hunger Games is young adult action. There are many books and series who write intricately about more than one story thread and vast swathes of characters - from the epic Les Miserables to something like Game of Thrones. Similarly, there are many classical and 'modern' books who head nose-first into the money shot.  ;I'm unsure about the symbolism since much of it is nonsensical terms that he made up himself. There are suggested explanations and possible roots of the words but I'm unsure if that's what you're going for.;"

There's quite a few websites out there that can help you get feedback and the like. No one expects to write brilliance at the first go and it's about gaining interesting ideas.

Quite literally, just write and don't think about it until you've reached the goal. It could be nothing, it could be something you want to continue!;I think what should also be remembered that for many of the fairy tales, they derived from very adult stories. I mean, in the very original version of Red Riding Hood, she did a striptease for the wolf...who was still in her granny's clothing...It's like... over a period of a few hundred years and there would be a fairytale version of 50 Shades of Grey. -shudders-;I'd have to agree with Deborah. Nazi Germany is a gruesome time in modern history which may have some relationships to the Grimm's Tales.  However, concentrating on that aspect is not really productive. It's close to the edge of Godwin's Law and the debate is becoming somewhat personal. (Additionally, this particular historical context is excruciatingly reductive. There are thousands of stories who have most or all of the elements of this story and these trail back throughout European history - with suggestions that this particular tale dates back to proto-Indo-European cultures. To concentrate on one it of history and ignore the rest is not especially useful.);You can find nationalism and ""supreme race"" ideologies anywhere.

It is an interpretation that implies too much 'logic', that a person cannot be abstract or creative or transcendental without some chemical in their system. It kinds implies two things:1.

However, in my experience in Problem Based Learning courses and peer assessment, it works on a two-pronged level.1. It allows you to improve what you write as you will become acutely attuned to the criteria to get a good mark.2. It allows you to develop critical skills and to see how other people approached the same problem.It's can only improve.*((*Subject to terms and conditions.));There is something so utterly delightful about that and I can't especially explain why but it does sound like the sort of thing that would be said during a tense scene with very intense, dramatic music.;What I know about the Alice illustrations from a documentary I watched years ago is that the illustrator was renowned for his satirical cartoons (which is why they can be rather peculiar and strange looking). I mean, if you look closely at the unicorn and the lion in Through the Looking Glass...it's Disraeli and Gladstone! Having them depicted as the Lion and Unicorn (both big ol' symbols of Britain and it's politics) and fighting, it's a political satire on the sly since these two are fighting, nobody around especially knows why and just wants them to stop.  The illustrations served two purposes - to engage the child and to let the adult grin too. It's like when animated/kids/family films slip in really clever/adult jokes that will probably go over the child's head but make the adult laugh and enjoy it too!;I always had in the back of my mind it was because they both had inky quills but I'm not sure it makes sense.;Outlandish?Perhaps by today's standards...;@CelineI'd say that Tom and Jerry appeals to slapstick humour. It's the Three Stooges, Charlie Chaplin, Jackass. The violence is so farcical and illogical that it is amusing.  Then again, there is something somewhat related:  schadenfreude. I think the bi;The books I grew up with were the likes of Roald Dahl and the Worst Witch (with things like Goosebumps, Jacqueline Wilson, Harry Potter   and Horrible Histories as I got older). I think that the first two had a pretty big influence on me. Roald Dahl knew that children like the grotesque and the icky. Whilst I am unsure about the anti-Semitism that some of his stories were meant to hold, some of his books held really important messages like...just because someone is your family, it doesn't mean they are correct or even good for you (Matilda). Or that cleverness and ingenuity can win out against poverty(Danny, Champion of the World. That grown ups can be scary but some of them are mad (Willy Wonka) or kind and gentle regardless of what they looked like (The BFG).I think the thing that I got from the Worst Witch was that even if you're a clumsy, scatterbrained and not good at school, you can still be a hero at the end of the day. That and magic schools are awesome.  ;I'm not offended by it. I think I have only been 'offended' once in my life by the violence in a story. That was 'The Penal Colony' by Franz Kafka which nearly made be vomit so I had to stop reading.  There are many reasons why I may not be offended and you may be. Perhaps it's because we could have differing levels of separation between the motion and the act (falls the shadow). Unless I have a deep connection to the characters and I don't know how the book ends, then violence doesn't especially effect or move me.  In the Grimm's Tales, I never connected with any of the stories. I could see parallels and symbolism and hidden meaning but on an emotional level, nothing. There wasn't a character I could have any emotional connection. With Alice, the worry about getting beheaded could be an issue but then again, I've seen the films since I was little. She was always dreaming and thus in no real danger. It does mean it's pretty damn annoying since you've kind of spoiled yourself! There's no peril or anything like that.But for some violence in books (or media in general), it can be played so...unrealistically that I can't feel anything from it. It's why I find horror films so ridiculously funny because it's about as realistic as David Cameron being the avatar of Lord Vivec. That being said, there has been times where it was turned my stomach and made me feel uncomfortable...Fair enough, if an animal is involved then I'm liable to crying. Christ, I cried when they exploded K-9 in Doctor Who.So, what is the point?From what I know of the next couple of assignments, these are not going to be fun topics for you. However, the only advice I can give you is to remind yourself that firstly, it is not real. Nobody real got harmed. Secondly, try to remain objective as you can. Pretend it's a really dull scientific paper that you're trying to understand.  Violence is an unfortunate aspect of the human race...it's something we can never stop. However, if you try and reassess the situation, there is some neurological evidence to suggest that if you reassess the text itself (i.e. look at it as a boring piece of academia than something really upsetting), it will stress you out far less than if you just try to suppress the disgust/anxiety associated with it.;No problemo!Reappraisal does take a bit of effort at the beginning but will make it a better overall experience for you in the end.

There may be other examples but tell me what you think.Carrol was relatively clear that he thought growing up sucked. However, the adult world that Alice was propelled into in the second book had a bit more of a feminine air, specifically for the ageing and 'stages' of life in females.With the flowers, there was something that definitely whiffed of a satire of social butterflies - of beautiful women at parties who seemed to only care about slagging off everyone else. I had always thought that the flowers were very snotty but it's only with this reading that it's very much in the realm of cattiness than anything else. One of them goes on about 'fading' and how hard it was to control yourself and it was just...very parallel to 'letting yourself go' and the vaguely hidden slander that could be being said.For the sheep, it just reminded me of grandmothers. Knitting and the white curly hair. I think Sylvia Plath referred to old grannies like that, could have been someone else. Additionally, the white queen seemed...kind of reminiscent of a dementia patient but I couldn't be certain.But don't you think so? Of course it's an idea I have been mulling but yeah!;Thank you, secondary anon.  Also, first anon, I dare say you would be disappointed by any interpretation. Whilst I am looking for critique (with counter examples since it is something that was suggested in feedback), essentially saying that these examples are just me applying my own life to the story is a bit over-dramatic and rather assuming considering that one of the biggest interpretations (from reading on this forum) is that it is about the tiresome process of growing up. I simply decided to concentrate on examples that seemed to correlate to big stages in female -specific development (and the exaggerations thereupon.)You're perfectly free to pick holes in theory but you seem to only be concerned with ""spoiling the charm"" of the story...which is pretty damn counter-productive to critical analysis of literature since it is intentionally going deeper than simple enjoyment and pleasure from reading the books.  ;Thanks for the heads up, man. I do hope that it isn't just a case of someone being nasty for the sake of nasty since it's seems like such an exhaustive activity when there's a LOT more that you can do on the Internet to entertain yourself aside from spoiling education.And there I had thought I had left the class clowns five years ago when I left high school...;I don't know about beautiful films but there is a parallel between The Six Soldiers of Fortune and one of the original Blackadder episodes The Black Seal.;It seems to be a common theme in a few stories (from Alice to Dorothy to Arthur Dent) who seem positively irritated that they have to stay in such a wonderful place. I know that should I be dropped into Wonderland or Oz or the Heart of Gold then I wouldn't especially care.

I mean, generally speaking, she did want to get to places (the nice garden and the eighth square). As for Dorothy, she was really kind.

But hmm, free will versus determinism. It's a tough one to answer...even outside of the confines of Alice. I suppose, overall, it is determined. Since she already knew the prophecy, she willed it to be fulfilled. Whether her willing it caused it or it was just coincidental is a bit hard to say. When we are dreaming, how much can be actually motivated? I think the answer lies in lucid dreaming.

Sometimes you sentences got rather long (e.g. the opening sentence) which made it hard to follow at times. Regardless of that, I think you did rather well! You had good examples and the theme was interesting. :3I'll post everything I got under this:Superficially speaking, the Alice stories could be descibed as nonsensical. However, there is still underlying causal models.  These examples of alternative causality reflect on changes in 'natural order' into  a scientific world.  At the time, such changes were rampant and may have seemed random. The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.  Firstly, look at Queen of Hearts and the White Queen. These reversals of causality (""sentencing first, then verdict"") have implications - from seeming silly to a miscarriage of justice. These examples are made explict. There are two examples of alternate models of causality that are also suggested. These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant.Chaos Theory implies that inital conditions causes differences in outcome, even if the cause is identical. An obvious example is Alice falling asleep. Each time, the conditions of where she falls asleep has an effect on how she experiences Wonderland. Should these conditions have changed in the slightest, then the experiece would also be greatly changed. It draws attention to the fact that even the smallest, unnoticeable factors may influence greater things.The other example is quantum indeterminacy and Schrodinger's Cat. Essentially, if you place a cat in a ealed box in which it may or may not die, it is in a state of flux. The cat is alive  and  dead. Only probability can determine the fate. Ironically, the life of the Chesire Cat is as probabilistic. The King and the executioner both argue about whether it is possible for the Chesire Cat to be executed i.e. whether the cat can die or not.It would only when they attempt to kill him that it would be known. From this, we can interpret that some things follow the laws of probabilty and not laws of causality.Conclusively, whilst Wonderland may seem random, there is still 'order'. It is a  story that attracts us to changes and dismisses them as nonsense as even having a few examples of non-typical causality implies that these changes are as mad as a hatter.Form:peer 1      The structure of the essay is perfect. You have proper beginning, main part and conclusion. However, I don't quite understand the meaning of this phrase: ""These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant.""peer 2      You have a very nice style here, with a couple of suggestions for further improvement.

And try not to talk directly to your reader (for example with ""look"" or ""you."") Overall, though, this is pretty well constructed.peer 3      I found your vocabulary very difficult to read because of the amount of terminology you used. (which was, however, highly skilled) At times, your essay was even difficult to understand because of this. Besides, I found a few misspellings which I found rather disturbing.peer 4      The essay has cohesion and coherence because it clearly deals with a topic and sticks to it until the end. I feel however that the explanations are a little messy and that organising your sentences might help you. You could use more connectors to make transitions between ideas smoother. The only typo I found was the a missing ""s"" in sealed.peer 5      Good solid structure support this well laid out essay. The opening paragraph opens the idea of the story not necessarily being nonsensical. There were a few spelling issues but I would hazard a guess that these were simple typos. I felt that they didn't detract from the reading of the essay in any way.Content:peer 1      You have the most interesting topic I've read by far, and you prove it with perfect examples. Also I quite like you mentioning the quantum indeterminacy and Schrodinger's Catpeer 2      I like the content; it's interesting and does get me thinking. I like the emphasis on chaos theory esp with your caveat (though he was a mathematician so it's possible). In places, I think you might support your generalities with a specific. I know that's tough because of the word limitations, but if you do so the essay will be clearer.peer 3      Wow, this is really a profound analysis of the story! I would be interested in your other sources (apart from the book itself). I must say that I was surprised at how you analyzed even the smallest details and always found some interesting patterns.peer 4      The content is certainly very interesting and well argued. However, I have the feeling it was too big a topic for such a short essay.peer 5      I loved the content of this essay. The possible connections to Chaos Theory is something that never even crossed my mind so I found this essay to be very thought provoking. The concept that whilst it appears nonsensical but that there may well have been order underlying it actually makes a lot of sense when one thinks about the love Lewis Carroll had for logic puzzles.Other Remarks:peer 2      Overall, this is a good essay. You have some interesting ideas here, and you kept my attention. A question that I have: Are some of these ideas from Paglia? If so you need to show the reader which ones are hers. Good luck in the course.peer 4      I think your ideas are very good, but they would come across as more powerful if you orginsed your writing a little bit.peer 5      Most enjoyable, thank you! I'm now going to have to re-read the books with a new light!peer 6      The point of Schrodinger's Cat and Cheshire Cat is interesting. I think you could expand it.;And this is obviously a problem!I can either skip this assignment (which would mean I would not be able to miss any other assignments or fail the course) or I can try and bluff it.There is no way in heck I'm gonna finish that in a day.

Im not quite done reading, but at this point Im kind of torn about what I think Bram Stoker thought about women. At the moment, Im leaning toward believing the thought that he delivered through Mina, ""Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness.""   He seems to think of women as gentle and fragile. Another, from Van Helsing to Mina: ""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? it is not always so with young ladies.""Another thought that I had, was that the vampirism was used as symbolism for sexual promiscuity. With the transfer of blood symbolizing the act. Jonathan Harker describes the female vampires in the castle as ""deliberately voluptuous"" and compares them to his innocent fiance, Mina, saying they have nothing in common. Pre-vampire Lucy is described as innocent and beautiful. When trying to save her, Arthur states that ""the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride"" and later, Van Helsing laughs at the fact that ""... this so sweet a maid is a polyandrist"" and he himself is a ""bigamist"" since Lucy had relieved blood from all the men, and Van Helsing was a widower. Something about women being tainted by the attentions of men here doesn't lead me to think of feminism. ;Wow, that is crazy.

Citizens here meaning ""women"", as one pamphlet is quoted as stating """"the extended  adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women""  and the story ends with a stark warning: ""After 40, [fertility] drops  95%.""But that's not exactly what you've asked. I think today there is a prevailing modern fairytale that we can ""have it all"".

Efthymia is correct that he wrote Dracula right after his friend Oscar Wilde was arrested for homosexual behaviours. There is speculation that Stoker himself may have been gay.

The eating of the increasingly larger animals was him fulfilling his hunger for blood, while working up to the inevitable task of biting a human. He still shies away from actually biting Dr. Seward, content to cut him and drink the doctor's blood off of the floor.

People had a problem with seeing the little Jew who was always more  inferior than them suddenly grow into an equal position, and sometimes succeeding more than them.  Antisemitism  spread not only in Germany, but also in France and Russian just as well. For example, there were enormous pogroms  in 1881, 1903 and more.

That being said, some people in this thread brought up good points in saying that looking up supplemental information can be useful. For example, if you do not understand the material fully or would like to find a ""starting point"" for your essay and are having trouble, looking elsewhere might give you the push that you need. Although, this could pose a problem in the sense that once you have been influenced by supplemental materials, your essay now becomes less genuine, in a sense, and you are using the ideas of others to produce your interpretation.

As for movies I'd have to say my favorites are Pan's Labyrinth, Labyrinth, A Knight's Tale, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Never ending Story, The Chronicles of Narnia (I also loved the books too), The Harry Potter series (books as well), and many others.  ;Right now, I'm limiting myself to this course's reading list.One at a time, for me...;I think fairy tales have evolved over time.   In today's day and age, we, as entertainment consumers, expect a much higher level of quality and polish from our stories than what the Brothers Grimm wrote in that book.   I know it is a translation done in the 1800's when literacy was still gaining momentum in society, so just having those stories in print was fancy and so the translation was as literally direct as possible.   This leads to storytelling conventions we would accept from a child, but not from a publisher, such as what seems to be an unnecessary continuation of the tale past its natural conclusion. The Frog Prince, specifically, comes to mind as at the end of the story, after he is restored to human form, there is his footman, who was never previously mentioned, has a personal event which, by the way it reads, seems to me like a last minute addition tacked on to the story.   This book gets a pass only on the justification that it is the first printing of these stories which are the basis of many works of fiction today.   If anyone tried to pull something like that in today's world, it would be edited out so fast, it just wouldn't be worth the time typing it.Bottom line: yes.   Fairy tales exist today.   But they have evolved from their early forms.;My opinion is that it depends on your thesis.   As long as the essay is thoughtful and insightful, it'll work.   Remember, the stated goal is ""to enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and the course.""   With that in mind, I'd say either the entire book or a single story thereof would suffice as long as your points are made.;From the HOME tab:  ""In our community, the readings, my videos, and your postings may be considered ""common knowledge."" Their contents do not require citation in this course."";This reminds me of a joke:   (Sexist as it gets, but funny...)A department store opened in New York City that sold men and a woman decides to visit it in search of a husband.At the store   s entrance, there   s a sign outlining the department store policy.  The first rule states that you can only enter the store once.  There are six floors and on each floor you can choose a husband or elect to move on to the next floor.  You cannot visit a floor more than once other than to leave the building.The woman visits the first floor.  The sign reads:    Men with jobs.  She moves on to the second floor:    Men with jobs that adore children.  She moves on the the third floor where the sign reads:    Wealthy men that adore children and are very handsome.  She thinks to herself, ""that's a very good deal"" yet moves on to the fourth floor:    Wealthy men that adore children, are very handsome and help with the household chores.  She decides to move on as things are constantly improving:    Wealthy men that adore children, are very handsome, help with the household chores and are very romantic.  The woman is about to make her purchase but can't resist moving on to the sixth floor.  There the sign reads:  You are visitor number 31,456,012 on this floor.  There are no men here.  This floor exists as proof that it is impossible to please women.  & MEN  _Opposite this department store, another department store opened that sold women. The sign on the first floor reads:    Women that love sex.  On the second floor the sign reads:    Women that love sex and are wealthy.  On the third floor the sign reads:    Women that love sex, are wealthy and have hot bodies.  Not a single man has visited the fourth floor.  (Copied from:  http://www.clickhere.gr/content/jokesdtlen.asp?JOKESEN_ID=326);That word ""undefined"" should be a checkbox.   This tells me that the checkbox element is not loading correctly.   Look in your internet browser menus for a ""compatibility mode"" option to enable or disable.   Otherwise, try another browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc...)   I have seen the checkbox work in Chrome and Internet Explorer in normal mode (Not Compatibility Mode).   Otherwise, look over your internet options and see if you have the security settings too high.   This being a computer-based format, there are any number of options that could be enabled/disabled causing the box to show up as ""undefined"".   I'll keep looking into it in case nobody gets back to you.Why yes, I work in I.T.   Why do you ask?  ;I write like H. P. Lovecraft.That's it.   No other names.   I'll try again on the next essay.;I've noticed that as well.   It's like my young son who starts off by telling me his dream last night, but I know at some point he's long done with what he actually dreamed and is now making up the story as he goes along to draw it out as long as he can hold my attention.   Reading these stories are a lot like that.   There are bits tacked onto the end after the main plot concludes.   And...   And... And...   I'm ready to move on to the next assignment.;  I observed that punctuation counts as spaces in the word count.Referencing a page range counts as 3 words.(Pg. 12-34)   ""Pg"", ""12"", and ""34"" are the 3 words as the punctuation does not count.This inflated my word count, so I shot and hit the high mark on the word count meter at the bottom to make sure I didn't foul by not writing enough on the essay.;I can't be positive yet, but I think that the assignments will be listed in order under ""Peer Responses"" as the course progresses.   We'll see for sure on Thursday.;Of course it is a valid thesis!   I myself, have changed roles over time, and will continue to change roles.   I am not a child anymore.   I am not that person.   I am not a teenager, early adult, single man, or childless, either.   Someday, my children will leave and I'll be an empty-nester, then maybe a grandpa, a retiree, etc...   My responsibilities, environment, companions, and experiences will all change and shape who I am.   There may be a core to my being, but I can honestly say I am NOT who I was 5 years ago.   Certainly not 10 years ago.   Definitely not 20 years back.   And the same goes for the future-me as well.   I plan to grow...;"

If you say people are writing perfectly from the get-go, then they have no room to improve.   Score ""1"" often early on, as appropriate, but save some for some late essays from students that just haven't made improvements.   Save the 3's for those truly exceptional pieces that will show up closer to the end of the course.   That is, unless you truly feel that the essay you are grading is flawless...Essentially, I would counsel everyone to relax about the grading distribution.   If you are fair, it will naturally fall within the expected limits.   If it doesn't, then averaged with everyone else's grading practices, I'd assume that the overall distribution would be close to expected.   Unless you show up as an extreme outlier, I don't think you will be scrutinized or penalized for doing your duty.;I have never read this book before. The reason being that I have seen the Disney movie of it and I didn't care for it either.   My mind, though creative, works very pragmatically and does not deal well with absolute nonsense. I do enjoy intelligent wordplay and funny puns, but this book takes it too far.   I've never done drugs and after reading that book, I'm doubly sure to never take them.   The story and imagery of this book is pure and utter madness!   Call it the literary equivalent of abstract art if you will.   I find no value in that form either.   I will certainly process the material and write an essay for the assignment, but I would not recommend this book to anyone other than as an example of how to write complete and utter nonsense.I had to get get that out of my system.   This book is just not my ""cup-of-tea.""   Thanks for listening.   No comments necessary.;While reading that book, I got the feeling of losing control of my mind.   It was completely unpredictable and did not follow any sort of ruleset.   The best analogy  I could come up with was that of drug use.   Yes, I am of a strongly logical mindset and this book bothered me a lot.   I could never write anything so randomly disjointed.   Was Carroll a user?   I have no data.   Do I personally think he was?   Logically, I don't have enough data to make an informed decision!   I have similar reactions to other media that are just as ""creative"" and instill ""trippy"" sequences for the ""enjoyment"" of the audience.   The  Heavy Metal and Felix the Cat  movies are also ""timeless classics"" that my collage buddies suggested that I didn't care for either.   My mind just doesn't roll that way.;Wow!   And I thought this thread wasn't going to go very far...I do enjoy some nonsense and ridiculousness, but in small doses.   This book is near wall-to-wall carpeted with it.   It's too much for my tastes.   That's all.   As for my comparing it to drugs: that was just frustration talking and making the stereotypical generalization.   I agree that you can be creative without drugs.   My logical mind just doesn't think the way the book is written.   I'm past the point of being ""out of my comfort zone"" and into ""it hurts to read it"", but I pushed through it all and now it shall set until Sunday when I will write my essay.;I will give that a try.   Knowing the culture in which it was written, since it's apparently so very different than mine of here and now, may very well give me the proper mental framework to make sense of the writings.   It's like the book is a big inside joke with me on the outside not getting it.   I need it explained to me in context.;I am not intentionally aligning with anyone but myself.   I speak for nobody but myself.   I do think that telling anyone that they should leave the course is constructive in any way.   I said this book was ""driving me crazy"", not that ""I can't deal with it.""   In fact, I said I would still process it and finish my assignment.   Hiding behind an ""Anonymous"" cloak shows paranoia if you are doing it to avoid reprisal.   I am not a vengeful person.   The worst I'll do to anyone here is...   dum dum DUM...   give your comment a down vote! (Oh the horror!)   I'm not going to tell anyone how to live their life, but I will say that I give ""Anonymous"" posts less consideration than those willing to own their words with an identity.   For that matter, how do I know you are the same Anonymous as the Anonymous three comments before?   I could post as Anonymous just after this post apologizing to myself profusely for whatever reasons I dream up, and nobody would be able to disprove the allegations.   By signing my posts with my login, the credibility of my posts are verified.   Nobody else may post as me.   Anonymous has no such validation.   Those are my thoughts, take them as they are.;Agreed, Stephanie.   Perhaps a unique alias would help the situation.   A screen-name one could use for this course alone and then dispose.   Even a  Student1234 style username would be unique to the setting yet anonymous enough to not fear physical stalking provided you don't provide personal information in any of your posts.   Just thinking out loud.   It's up to the site designers to implement it if they so choose.;I like that there was no original answer.   It fits with the rules-be-damned style of the book.   The fact that people demanded an answer, required closure even, supports my own feelings that this book was intentionally written in a style contrary to common thinking.;Unhelpful, Luis.   She is dealing with processing her emotions.   Help her with explanation so she can be enriched from the book.I hear you, Suzanne.   I'm personally dealing with Alice's Adventures myself if you've read some of the other threads.   It doesn't make sense to me.   However, I'm hearing that you are dealing with an emotional hurdle of the horrific actions of some characters.   I don't know if it'll help, but here goes:   They are only stories.   These events did not actually happen.I say these things not to trivialize how you feel, but to offer a bypass of those reactions to allow you to see and think about the other aspects of the readings.   For what it's worth, I agree with you.   Those actions are monstrous and no civil world would allow such things to take place.   To be offended by it?   It's not worth the effort.   You may not like it, nobody can make you feel otherwise.   But to ask others to feel as you do is just as futile.   I'm sure some others do.   But for now... it's just a story.   Pure fiction.;That's odd.   I suppose the original poster deleted his comment.To answer the title of this thread, yes and no.   The points are for reputation only and can be seen by clicking the link for ""top posters"" at the bottom of the forum's page.   Does it count towards the class grade?   I don't think so.    It's sort of an ego/participation meter.   But there you go.;HA!;I'm yet another descendant of those colonial separatists.   And I freely admit that our english is not  (capital E)  English.I had my share of nursery rhymes growing up, but not so much British literature.   I started out with Encyclopedia Brown books which then led me to read  The Complete Sherlock Holmes and The Lord of the Rings.   Boy oh boy are those dry reads for a 10-year old!   I went back to The Three Investigators series, sponsored by Alfred Hitchcock, which were more appropriate for my age then.   Forced by the then semi-competent public school system to read assorted Charles Dickens novels (he was paid by the word, I hear) I actually grew to dislike the British writing style until Terry Pratchett happened on the scene with his Discworld novels.   Funny story:   I got the first two books of the series by accident when I was late in returning the slip from the Science Fiction Book Club one month.   When the books arrived, I shrugged and gave them a go.   Liking them, I just chalked it up to ""times have changed"".Summed up regarding the Alice stories:   I'm just out of time and place to appreciate them to their fullest.;        I think visual formatting is important too.   I put 5 spaces before the first word of any paragraph.   Only one ENTER after the final line as the automatic formatting leaves sufficient padding between paragraphs.   And try to make paragraphs at least 3 lines (not necessarily sentences) across the page to please the eye.           Solid blocks of text without paragraphing are to be avoided at all costs. I marked someone as a 1 in the first assignment just for that.   It was hard on my eyes and when I had to blink or look away, it took a large fraction of a second to find my place again.   Yes, it's a small amount of time, but it's annoying.   Proper formatting could have alleviated that.   Make the reader's job easier, already!;You seem to have missed the words ""at least"" in my post.   I'm not advocating short packets of information.   Just the opposite.;It was about four o'clock in the afternoon and the lithe and slimy corkscrew-like lizard-badgerswere spinning and punching holes in the grass plot around the sundial under which they made their home.Flimsy and miserable were all those shabby-looking birds with their feathers sticking out all around like a live mopand the green pigs who lost their way home were making some kind of bellowing, wheezing, sneezing sound.(It makes much more sense reading it this way, but it's not poetic.)  ;There does not necessarily have to be an author's intention involved when selecting a theme.   It's just your point of view as a reader.   In fact, there are probably many subconscious themes in most works if you believe the psychologists throughout the ages. Relax and give us whatever insights you have.   If you can defend them successfully, I see no reason you would get bad marks.;@GusThat's two words.   Sorry, I had to do it...   :P;""Never imagine yourself""Do not think of yourself""not to be otherwise"" (a double negative)to be anything but""what it might appear to others""what others see you as""that what you were or might have been""due to your true self""was not otherwise than what you had been"" (another double negative)which would be the same""would have appeared to be otherwise.""unless you looked differently to others.Further condensing the sentence:   Think of yourself as others perceive you to be due to your true self.Further condensing and inverting the of sentence (putting the negatives, double and otherwise, back into it):   Don't pretend to be something you aren't. (a queen in this case)That's how I read it...;Agreed.   It is an intentionally confusing sentence.Likewise, nullifying double negatives does not always reveal the true intent of a statement.""I am not unhappy"" is not the same as saying ""I am happy.""There are going to be numerous takes on what that particular sentence means.;I'm starting to read Dracula.   The approach of telling the story through multiple first-person perspectives is a significant shift from the 3rd person stories we have read in this course so far.   I personally know some people who deride first person narratives as having too narrow a perspective and others who say it enhances the immersion.   The only gripe I have with it is that you know the storyteller will survive the whole of the book, barring any epilogue.   Dracula overcomes this by having multiple narratives, and I applaud this approach.   I'm going to cop-outSo my question at large is:   which style do you prefer best and why?   I'm going to cop-out and say that I have no preference as long as it's executed well.;Most people I talk to who are voracious readers often agree with my description that when I read, I visually ""see"" the scene playing out in my head as I read the words.   I'm so far past sounding out words, that meaning just seems to flow into my brain as my eyes scan the lines.   So yes, first, third, over-the shoulder third (like many video games), etc...   do affect how my mind visualizes the scene.There is a book by John Steakley called Armor that swaps back and forth between 1st and 3rd person.   The author is now deceased, but if done right, I think the book would make an excellent movie.;This sounds like a sales pitch.   You've pitched this once before in another thread that's now buried.   I do not think this is appropriate behavior for the course.   Otherwise, I like your style.;I think you suffer a bit from rushing through it.   I had the same reaction as you, but I finished the reading early on and had the better part of a week to digest it all before I wrote my essay.   I'm better for it, but those books still aren't my favorites by a long shot. But it's all been discussed in this other thread I started:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=288;I assume this class has a high attrition rate early on.   Several posts of the frenetic pace and workload have been made.   More posts are made fretting about the grading scheme or grades received.   If egos are of any concern, I expect the attrition rate to continue at a rapid pace until about the halfway point where it will level off or, at least, dwindle to a trickle.As people fall off the rosters and only those devoted to making the efforts to stay in the course remain, I fully expect the quality of writing to improve by several orders of magnitude.   That's my prediction anyway.;Agreed.   3 of the 5 essays I just graded had no clear thesis.   Naturally, the thoughts were not focused and wandered about.   In one essay alone, I pointed out 3 separate topics that each would make a good thesis, but were not supported with a reference.   I felt a little draconian handing out so many 1's, but that's what they earned.   Hopefully , they will take my recommendations to heart and improve their form and focus.;"

In the first round, I only got 2 of 5 comments on the content.   Comments are what really drive my learning to become a better writer.   Not commenting is not helping.   I need to know what is right, and what can be improved, and HOW it can be improved.   I'm here to learn something.   I assume that most everyone else in this course has a similar, if not the same, goal.;Someone needs to invent a scratch-n-sniff monitor first.;Try this one.   It's a thread I started sometime last week.https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=326;Allow me to add the ability to crawl on walls as like a lizard.Also add the ability to change into a wolf or large dog as seen escaping from the boat as it made land.I'll point out that  Dracula can enter houses without invitation, like when he has the wolf break the glass for him so he can  get in to Lucy's bedroom for that last time.Yes, it was daytime that Drac visited the wolf at the zoo, but nighttime when he broke it out of his cage.   So I think he can get about during daylight hours if he must.;Strange rule.   Even my son's friends know better that to try that!   But then again, I live in a city.   My rule is: unless I gave you a key, there better be some knocking first! (Or doorbell, but you get the point.)But I don't make the rules governing vamps...;I can let a mistake or two go without hurting the grade.   I've noticed that the essay entry box does not flag spelling errors like, say, the forum input boxes do.   But seriously, if everyone would at least cut / paste their essay into a word processor and run spell-check / grammar-check, many of the problems would be fixed.   If someone doesn't have MS Word, they can get Open Office Writer for free.   I'm sure there are any number of free online services available as well.   I just implore that people check their work somehow before submitting it.   Of course, the rub is that there are likely hundreds of people who don't participate on these forums that won't hear my plea...;Agreed.   Prof. Rabkin stated somewhere that the suggested text is considered to be common knowledge and does not need to be cited.   As such, other editions need to be cited if used as they are not considered to be the suggested text because they, like you said, may have supplemental material such as prefaces or annotations not present in the course-suggested text.   (Breathe!) Contrariwise, citing the  course-suggested text, while not necessary, should not be counted against the essay's form either.   It's not hurting anything by being there, right?So just to be safe, I cite everything.;One thing I'm liking in Dracula is the diverse accents used by the characters.   Most of the players are proper British, but there is Dracula himself who speaks excellent English, but has a few syntax flaws (of which he is very aware) to distinguish him as a foreigner.   Likewise, the old fisherman speaks a very course version of English that I'd say is very probable to give some non-native English speakers some trouble when reading it. (And even some native ones too!)   The game warden of the zoo speaks a low version of British (Cockney?) where ""h"" is often dropped from the beginning of words that usually have them and occasionally added to words that don't.   (My Fair Lady explains this phenomenon better)   Van Helsing, being Dutch, speaks his English with the sentence structure of his native tongue which also distinguishes him as a foreigner.   What's hilarious to me, though, is the Texan who courts Lucy.   His language goes way beyond American English into ridiculous wild-western buzzwords so much that it almost becomes unintelligible again.   But it serves its purpose for character development.Not my essay.   Just my thoughts today.;Dutch is a derivative of the West Germanic language.   That, and Van Helsing seems well-travelled.   I'm sure some idioms are naturally favored by him.;Indeed.   Only one commentator of the 4 who reviewed my essay left useful comments.   The other 3 ""phoned it in"" with useless comments like ""Good job"" and the like.   NONE of them left general comments for improvement in the third section.   NONE!   Blank!   It's difficult to improve without meaningful feedback.   I try to give good service to those essays I review.   I write, with examples, somewhere between 3 to 5 lines in each section.   The last section I use to recapitulate the first two sections in what I intend to be a friendly conversational voice.   So yes, please make good faith efforts to give meaningful reviews of essays just as you want the same for the essay on which you made good efforts to complete and submit on time.;I'm leaning toward this train of thought as well.   I do not mind peer reviews, but I'd much rather review and be reviewed by those I consider to be my intellectual  peers and not anonymous people.   I admit it's snobbish of me to think that I'm better than any group of people...   but I am.   I know there are many of my co-students in this course with which I would happily converse and freely exchange essays.   But there are many that I'm sure haven't even bothered to log in to these discussion boards that are still submitting work of which I have the displeasure of reviewing.   Honestly, I will take someone's opinion to heart much more readily if I have a relationship, even if it is just a name, over the faceless ""Anonymous"".   (The above poster does not count as she signed it ""Lori"". Thanks!)As such, since there is no overt affect on my life from submitting essays, (not that anyone else besides Coursera staff would know if I did or not) I am on the fence as to if I will make the effort to submit any more.   I will keep thinking about the readings as if I were to submit essays as that is the point of the course.   I have a decision to make before noon tomorrow...;Joanna, you play to my ego and it is a good move.   I hastily wrote something down for Dracula.   I admit it won't be my best work, but it's still better than some essay's I've read.   If I can be of service through providing examples of well-composed essays (at least in form if not always in content) then I will happily do so.   I'll leave it to my imagination to suppose that others are actually improving through exposure to my prose.Wow!   I haven't written something that self-aggrandizing in...   ever!   I'm going to slink off now and put my ego in check.;You made me think.   I couldn't remember if I used ""I"" in my essays.   It turns out, I didn't.   Scores 4 and 4.5 so far.   As Katrina mentioned, writing with an assertive voice as an authority on the subject will help.   I find that it naturally precludes the use of ""I"".;You could have written: ""The five examined patients..."" or""Upon examining five patients...""  or""Of the five patients examined...""The English language is extraordinarily flexible.   There is almost always a way to rephrase a clause to suit a purpose.;It is the influence of modern times (American?) that stories now climax with a ""boss fight"" like in video games.   It gives a clear rush of action and a decisive victor to the story.   You can usually tell who's going to win, too.   I think the movie dragged out the ending more dramatically.   I'll have to watch it again sometime.That being said: I liked how the book ended.   It said that Drac (he let's me call him Drac) got a look of triumph as the sun set in that instant before he was slain.   Had the men acted an instant later, Drac might haved turned to mist and escaped destruction.   Yes, Van Helsing had sealed his castle from him, but that being his homeland, I'm sure Drac could have found another place to hide and rally.   The story ended about as logically well as a fantasy novel could hope for.;While it has been remarked in another thread that Van Helsing's Dutch accent isn't convincing to someone who knows an authentic Dutch accent, I do like that there is an innocent mistranslation between language and culture.   While ""bloomin"" and ""bloody"" are swear words in the British culture, as an American, those particular words hold little shock value to me.   To see them represented by Van Helsing's quote of ""with bloom upon them and also with blood"" just removes the shockingness of the epithet even more.   Yes, I chuckled when I read it.   I do enjoy a good muddle of the English language when done for amusement purposes.   (Stoker's intent, not Van Helsing's.);Agreed.   I'm down to throwing out *A* point with *A* piece of evidence.   It does feel more like ""food for thought"" rather than making a grand, deep, statement.;From a psychological perspective, I'd venture to say that by including references to famous works of literature, an author attempts to legitimize their own reputation as a person of education and intelligence.   It shows that they are, at the least, literate, and possibly even well-read.   Why re-invent the wheel if you can steal one from an old cart, right?   In any case, in Dracula, all the parts are told in first person perspective forcing a certain point of view.   This means that all narrative comes from the mind of an individual character at any given time and can be used for character development.   If that character cares to quote from an earlier work to show familiarity of it, then so be it.   I think the references are used effectively in Dracula.;I did not detect any ""homo"" angles in Dracula.   That's more than can be said for anything by Anne Rice, though.   She took that angle and owned it in her books.;I admit, it has been a while since I read those chapters.   The last chapters are still the freshest in my mind.;Good discussion!   Even Van Helsing obliquely acknowledges that vampires predate Christianity in referring to his research of old legends.   So it follows that the articles of faith used to ward of Dracula gain their powers from the devoutness and certainty of the people placing the articles.   So...   If Van Helsing was an atheist (he wasn't, of course) and did not believe in the authenticity of the sacraments he was using, would they still have worked?   What articles of faith worked BEFORE the rise of Christianity?I have mentioned Terry Pratchett in other threads as a favorite author of mine.

I felt sad for Lucy, and also very frustrated as I watched her struggle to live.   I feel really sorry for her. I also feel very sorry for Renfield too.

You talk about speed and that  s true! I marvelled on how very fast-paced and packed with excitement Dracula is. And I like what you say about science and faith. Very romantic period, isn  t it? I read the other day that Dracula is also considered an invasion novel. I liked that idea, even if invasion novels deal more with the invasion of armies and the like.

There's definitely strong connection between then and now, but I doubt future is feeding any information to the past.

This is how is worked last time, and as far as I can tell this time is the same:For each of the ten essays, you get a mark out of 6 based on the peer-evaluations. Your overall grade is the average of your highest seven essay grades.The essay marks are based on the peer evaluations. Each essay should be evaluated by approximately 5 peers, and the mark you get allocated for the essay is based on the mark they each give you out of six. I can't remember if it's the median mark of the five grades, or the average after removing the highest and lowest.Peer marking isn't always the best solution but in this case there are  far too many of us for the uni staff to mark them all personally. I think the principle of having multiple markers and only needing to complete 7 essays to pass is that any extreme marking gets cancelled out and if you're really unlucky with your peer-markers one week then at least that shouldn't affect your overall course mark too much. As I say, not ideal, but a decent attempt at a compromise.;"

I think this association of Alice in Wonerland with the drug scene is due to the unique style and originality of the work. But at a closer look, there's nothing really remotely close to drugs in Alice in Wonderland. The Caterpillar was smoking   hoocah, yes,   but it was common in Victorian England to smoke hookas, pipes, cigars, etc. the British Empire reached far away countries, and trade with those place made common to find in Londos all sort of products, including opium, which was perfectly normal n those times, it was not stigmatized in those times.  The changes in Alice's size, it's a metaphor of the changes a child undregoes as s/he grows up. The child is not aware of his gradual growth, until one day he realizes s/hes no longer a child, and society and fmily starts treating them as teenagers, or ""small adults"". This causes confusion, stuppor, fear....teens are no longer kids nor adults, they experiment sudden changes in their bodies. Alice in Wonderland is a guide to help kids navigate through life. Life is weird sometimes, shocking, exciting...life is the smile of a Chesire cat, life a beutiful garden full of soldiers and life is all that the imagination can come up with, that's why Alice in Wonderland is today as popular as it was a century ago.Works cited:Go Ask Alice, by Jefferson Airplane.Alice in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.FORMpeer 1     There were a number of grammatical errors in your paper as well as a couple of typos.  An example of these are in your third paragraph.  Your last sentence is a run-on sentence that would work best if split into two or three separate sentences.  Also, the first sentence of your concluding paragraph would be more grammatically correct if written as ""The changes in Alice's size is a metaphor for the changes a child undergoes transitioning into adulthood.""  I would omit ""s/he"" from essays in the future.  Not only is your usage a bit inconsistent, but there are better ways of dealing with the third person and gender.  peer 2     There were a few misspellings and grammatical errors, but overall the easy flowed well as was easy no read.peer 3     I find the way you put you're sentences are good and correct, here and there there are some grammer errors but it is not that big of a problem, beacause I can understand that I also make them (because English is not my first language)peer 4     You begin your essay with a title 'Alice in Wonderland and the drug culture.' Yet halfway along your essay you seem to forget the title. So here is a comment on structure, which can be improved. Also you have some spelling - issues in your essay and I think you could easily have gotten this right if you checked the text thoroughly before submitting it. For instance: hoocah, hookas,place in stead f places, Londos in stead of London, n in stead of in.Now it looks like though you rushed and didn't take the time to go over your essay again. Maybe you did, and that would be a shame.peer 5     First of all, there are a lot of typos or words written wrong, plus some of the sentences are not quite grammatically correct. The essay doesn't seem to lay out clearly its argument, the first three paragraphs are about Alice and drug culture and the last one is about something totally unrelated.CONTENTpeer 1     I found your essay very fascinating.  The dreamlike state of Wonderland is often compared to a drug-induced state in popular culture, despite the fact that this was not Carroll's intention.  Your insights, however, were difficult to follow, as you had no clear thesis statement.  Here is a link to a site full of useful information relating to essay writing: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/545/01/ This particular page walks writers through properly formulating a thesis statement.peer 2     While I think the essay made some really interesting points, but it wasn't really a literary criticism of the novels. It focused more on historical references to the books. Try to focus solely on what is in the books.peer 3     It was very interesting reading this, because I learned so much , for instance I didn't knew the drug history. Maybe you could have included a quote from the book to show an example of ""society and fmily starts treating them as teenagers, or ""small adults"" .peer 4     You start your essay by giving it a title. In the opening sentences you talk about the influence Alice in Wonderland has had on the drug scene, but halfway your essay you seem to forget all about the tittle and you end by saying that the book helps kids navigate through life. So your conclusion has got nothing to do with your title and opening. Thus, I think you could improve your train of thought/your argumentation and logic by staying on the subject and telling us what you think about 'Alice in wonderland and the drug culture.' After reading your essay I have learned that AAW was an inspiration in songs and the name of drugs. This is nice to know, and interesting, but what are you trying to say/prove exactly?  peer 5     I feel that the author of the essay had this thesis (a pretty obvious one) in mind before reading Carroll's book. I won't dare to say that he/she never read the books but this is what it seems, that the argument is constructed around what everybody knows about Alice. The essay actually says nothing about the books, it talks about drug culture (present and Victorian) and its circumstantial relation with Carroll's work, but no more than that. A poor essay for two rich books. A pity.COMMENTSpeer 1     I highly recommend checking out the Purdue OWL website.  I use this site like an essay-writing bible.  There is also a section on doing a proper works cited page.  I gave you a 1 in form and a 2 in content and firmly believe that your writing skills will only improve as we continue through the course.  I enjoyed reading your essay and best of luck.peer 3     Very good job!! I enjoyed reading this , learned alot too and it was interesting to see another point of view . Next time, maybe you should focus a bit more on you're grammar .peer 4     In fact, I think you should delete the last part of your essay and rewrite it so that it comes back to the opening (the drug scene) again and you should close with an original thought which would linger in the readers mind for a while.;I am. It's a bit boring now , lot's of chick stuff so far....I joined because Jorge Luis Borges, my fav autor is in the syllabus. Also Faulkner and Mellville caught my eye.But now we are stuck with Jane Eyre,   and we had Manon L' Escaut the past week....I am about to have a nervous breakdown. I need some ""male stuff"" pronto!The lectures are interesting, but it's all focused about the actions of the characters, why did they do what they did, etc, very subjective readings,   and I wanted some more general lessons about literary techniques, something more objective.;Some of the interpretations of professor Rabkin are so technical and ""black and white"" that it is hard to dispute them.For example, Mina's full name is Willhelmina, meaning Will (strenth, resolution), and helmina , which is a cognate of helmet (protection, security)And her role of to display a great will to protect against the evil of Dr  cula.But I wonder....did  Bram   Stoker deliverately  designed all of this? Or was it just a random coincidende?, and he just happened to like that name?I've googled the name Wilhelmina, and seems a popular name, there's several places in the English speaking countries called like that.what do you think?;Randomness is part of life, as is chaos and nihilism.Of course an author is gonna give a lot of thought to any single word on the text, but unless Bram Stoker himself said ""I chose Willhelmina to reflect strong opposition to Dracula"" it wont be but an interpretation. And interpretations are subjective.;"

I must admit I wrote it in a rush, it took me around 10 minutes the whole thing, that's why is a bit weak,;t's okay sweetie, you did a good job. To tell you the truth, I improvised the whole thing. I read Alice in Wonderland, and Thorugh the Looking Glass when I was 20, (16 years ago), and since I am doing several courses at the same time, I didn  t have time to re-read it again, so   just used what I remembered.Why don  t you post you eassay, so we can compare?;Three Views on Dracula.      Dracula has multiple meanings and nuances. It's the story of the paranoia of the British people, about being invaded by ""dark"" continental Europe. In the time it was written, late eighteenth century, the British Empire was the main superpower in the world, and as such, people tended to perceive unexistent threats from the conquered countries. The conqueror always fears the latent thirst for revenge from the conquered.   Count Dracula represents the perils of the foreigner...the evil  who lurks in the shadows of the night, ready to feed on the blood of the British citizens.Another perspective, would lead us to see  sexual imaginery. The neck is one of the most vulnerable - and   erotic - parts of  a woman's body.  When a man makes love to a woman, the woman tends to raise her chin and offer her neck...it's a proof of trust, by  offering   her neck, she  implies   her submission to the man, her willingness to be taken by him in an unreserved way. Nothing is as enticing and encouraging for a man who is mounting  an aroused   woman, than seing   her offering her neck in an unreserved way. By killing Dracula, Bram Stoker possibly made a point in support of women's right. Remember than in those days, women could not even vote, and were little more than sexual slaves in many aspects.An equally interesting reading is about how a group of people react to  a danger. Jonathan Harker could have focused on saving his neck (no pun intended) and forget about the whole thing as soon as he was out of danger's way. But he spared no effort until Dracula and his harem of female vampires were destroyed. And they were willing to risk their own lives. How close this social commintment to a cause is related to the cause of Irish independence from the United Kingdom is a valid hypothesis of specualation, since Bram Stoker was an Irish supporter of the independence.FORMpeer 1     The text seemed written correctly in grammar question, but I think it lacked coherence. The first and last paragraph would make more sense together, opening the text with the second.peer 2     I struggled with whether or not to give a 1 or 2 on this essay for format and finally decided a 2 would be overly generous, but a 1 would be too harsh. The writing itself is not bad and the writer did do a good job of breathing their own personality into the writing (something that can be very difficult in an essay format). There are several errors in spelling and grammar that really should have been attended to (imaginery is probably the most flagrant of these). Be more careful in the future -- your essays will be all the better for it!peer 3     Your grammer is very good, but the structure of your essay leaves something to be desired. Our assignment is to write one short paragraph on one aspect we found intriguing, not offer multiple different perspectives.peer 4     Using three different perspectives was a unique idea from others that I have read.  The structure, grammar, word usage and the arguments were stated fairly clearly and well defined.  I was able to follow where you were leading me.  You cited some British history that made some facts a little clearer.  Overall the form is pretty good.  You can always work to make it better.CONTENTpeer 1     I founded the very question of conquest and conquered. However, the second point of view, women, it seems a little forced on the issue of defense and right on the issue of sexuality. Could have opened with this text - women - and made a continuation between the beginning (first paragraph) and end (last).peer 2     An essay should be prepared to expound and defend a unified statement about a text. Especially if you're limited in word count as our course is. In the future, it might be wise to assume that if you can explain and give evidence enough to support your point in a single paragraph, you have not allowed yourself to venture far enough in your mental meanderings. I hope you discover new insights in our upcoming readings and that you enjoy the process of helping your peers encounter those wise revelations with you as the communicating medium!peer 3     Overall, you have some good points. But, as I stated before, your lack of focus (and of a thesis statement) detracts a great deal from your essay. This essay is all over the place, and failed to fulfill the assignment.peer 4     The content of this essay was divided into three equal sections.  Each section covered a different topic.  The first topic covered the paranoia of the British people of the eighteenth century and how people dealt with the ideas expressed during that time.  The. Second topic concerned the sexual aspect of Dracula.  While the third topic covers how people deal with danger.  I think all topics were covered well  with  arguments from our readings.  COMMENTS  peer 3     Point of fact: Dracula was written in the late nineteenth century, not the eighteenth.peer 4     The essay gave me several new thoughts to reflect upon once this class is over.  Right now there is still much more reading to finish.Score: 3.5;Very good essay, Celine. Both Dracula and Christ died by the cross, so it would make sense that Dracula resurrected too, in/through the  womb of Mina.Christ had his apostles, Dracula had gypsies. (no offence to gypsies, but that's how were they portrayed in those times)Christ went to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel , Dracula went to London, the capital of the British Empire.Christ versus Maria Magdalene; Dracula versus Mina.;Some women   gave birth to Adolph Hitler, Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, Ariel Castro, etc. Women produce monsters on a daily basis, maybe if men had a change to give birth they would not do a worse job.;"

I would had given you a 3 for form, since I didn  t spot any spelling, or grammar mistake (but since I am an ESL, I can  t be completely sure)And a 2 for content. Your essay was interesting, but the part of regional dialects and accents seem too far fetched. Somebody from Glasgow could have a perfectly clear conversation with somebody from Los Angeles...or two guys from the same city could feel worlds apart, it's not the accent, or regional dialect what makes   people feel close or distant to/from another fellow human, its their own mindset, their intellectual similarity.I agree that for a non speaker would be harder, and will have a hard time getting an idiom, but as soon as he learns the meaning of that particular idiom, or expression, that info will remain stable in his memory, ie, they can evolve and learn.Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Wonderland, seemed to lack this capability to evolve, they seem to live in a permanent world of nonsense and paradox, so appealing  for   children, and sometimes so irritating for adults. That's why some adults find Alice a tiresome reading.Just a little comment about your idiom example. Since we are commenting a children's book, you could have used a less technological one, for example ""it's raining cats and dogs"", wich is funny and more in tune with Alice, rather than one about ghosts and computers. But this is just my personal opinion, sweetie pie.Let's see if our essays cross paths again, bella ragazza.;Edgar Allan Poe used to get some booze left on his grave....a few years ago, this event suddently ended. so it was speculated that the mysterious fan had died.I would replace him gladly if I lived in Baltimore.;Did I request thee, Maker, from my clayTo mould Me man? Did I solicit theeFrom darkness to promote me?    Those lines belong to Milton, in Paradise Lost. They belong to Adam, the first man who walked on Earth .  We don  t know why we are here. Somebody, or something created us.  Or perhaps it was just a random event in the big universe. Some people accept it, and try to live their short  lifespan on Earth as good as they can. Others don  t accept it, they can  t accept to be somebody's creation, thus embarking in a personal crusade to create themselves life.  This is the case of Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the eponym ""creature"", and title of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. He failed. He thought he could create human life by adding a few limbs and bones and tissues. But humans are more than the sum of their parts, and the ""monster"" refused to be a mere puppet in doctor Frankestein  s hands.  He demands, what all humans want: love. So he asks his creator to provide him a companion, a female version, a girlfriend. In the meantime, he shows that there's no boundaries when there is faith: he teaches himself to talk and read.But drama, so human, so pervading in society does not   wait too much to make its presence: Victor Frankenstein destroys the female version, and the monster murders in revenge Elizabeth, the wife of Doctor Frankenstein.  Blood for blood. Creator and created represent the bond of madness and violence that connects humankind. They sepend their last days chasing each other, reaching the North Pole. Creator and created  feed on  each other's hate, they are the ying and yang of life.No matter how, when man plays to be god, he will always lose the battle.FORMpeer 1     You were a bit clumsy in language and syntax, but maybe English not your native language?    To create    themselves life    isn   t correct, and I am not sure what it means.

I liked your description of them as the yin and yang. Not sure about a    bond of madness and violence connecting mankind   . Rather a negative view? peer 2     Your  thesis  was  not  clear  to  me.  Calling  Frankenstein  and the  Monster  yin  and  yang  seems  to  me  to  be  a  misunderstanding  of  both.

They say frog, the rest of the world jump. And I like it that way, I prefer American English than British  English any day of the week, it's much more clear and easy to understand.

I prefer Andersen's stories any day of the week.;I just started reading The Birthmark, and the first sentence struck me as odd:""In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy""I am just an ESL guy, but aint eminent an adjective here? So as such, it should be accompanied  by a noun. For example, ""eminent man"", ""eminent doctor"", etc.If  it works as a noun, it should be eminence,  for example ""Michael is an eminence, proficient in all sort of stuff"", or ""Laura is a Brazilian eminence, proficient in maths"".Maybe it's jut a small detail, but I find it odd to get this at the very first sentence of a text. Is it random, or there's some sort of second meaning?;Another possible way could    turn them both into adjectives of man, like ""a man of science, eminent and proficient in every branch of natural philosophy""I doubt an author like Nathaniel Hawthorn could make such basic mistake. Is this a problem with the edition?Maybe it's silly, but I am the kinda guy who gets obsessed by little details like that, I can  t keep with the reading. HELP!;Okay Sean, thanks. It makes sense some sort of language change due to historical reasons. I found a similar  problem in the Grimm Brothers stories, for example  ""the Wolf waked up"" instead of ""woke up.""   The only thing I know about Nathaniel Hawthorne is that Herman Melville dedicated to him Moby Dick, since they were friends in real life so I  thought he was more ""modern"" than he really is. And I guess I think  Herman  Melville is modern, because he is the great-grandfather of New York singer Richard Melville Hall aka   Moby. It's amazing how the unconscious works. I love Moby, I love Herman Melville, so I guess I am supposed to love Nathaniel Hawthorne, even if it's gonna be a rough  reading.  I got ADD (Atention Deficit Disorder)....one hour ago, I  was totally focused, ready to face The Birthmark like a champ. But it just takes an unexpected distraction and it's all gone, it's gonna take hours to regain a focused state of mind.;I am not joking, I am not reading a single word more of The Birthmark until I get a satisfactory answer....I am gonna barricade in my room, I got enough food   and water to survive for a couple of months, and will drop my waste out the window.Radical problems demand radical solutions.Alea jacta est!!!;Mmmmm, I took a peep and found this, just  a few lines later:   ""  it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy ""It should be ""in its deep and absorbing energy""It's gonna be a bit nerve racking to find grammar mistakes like this all over the text....;I see it now, thanks. Both depth and absorbing energy are adjectives of ""love"". I thought first that ""depth"" was an adjective of "" energy"".If every line of the Birthmark is like that, maybe I'll finish it in a couple of years, lol.;The mother of Poe was an actress. She was ""killed"" hundreds, perhaps thousands of times during the plays. And Poe, just a kid, was always a member of the audience.For a child, to see your mother dying, and coming back to life over and over....I guess it's not very educational or constructive. Tis maight be the root couse of Poe's obsession with death.This idea is not mine, of course, I read it in his biography.PS, not to mention the fact that every single woman he loved had a painful, premature death, for example his stepmother, his cousin-wife, etc.;Poe was a man of action and passion  and men of action do stuff. Yes, many of his characters are crazy and have intense, long monologues....but sooner or later they get moving, and they don  t ask why, they ask how.Look for example the  Cask of Amontillado. The  Montresor   says "" Fortunato   has offended me""....and that is enough for him to go and do what he did.  The reader doesnt have a clue of  what type of offence  Fortunato did in order to deserve that ending....it's just the actions,  what matter in Poes stories.  ;saylor.orgMismo nivel que coursera, pero sin fechas ni essays.;I got a Scandal in Bohemia   and a couple of The Monkey's Paw.My flabber was never so gasted!;I said I got a Scandal in Bohemia, and a couple of Monkey's Paw, but I didn  t say where.... I got them in my local   library. I love wordgames and nonsense. My parents were divorced and stuff.;Poulomi, it's an American joke. In the   90s  series Friends, one of the characters was all the time justifiying his mistakes, quirkiness   on the gounds that his parents were divorced. Children of divorced parents tend to have their heads messed up. And he used  to say it    in such a comical way, that the sentence became popular, and many people say it nowadays.;It's not my own joke...anyone can use it, there's no copyright for jokes.You are just a Friends hater.....probably a Seinfield supporter.;I noticed that coursera is very visual. Not only the   courses themselves, but the way the whole system is designed, with lots of pictures, and colors, it's like being in a university theme park.You got the names of the courses, they tend to be very flashy, like ""Know Thyself"", ""How Things Work"", ""Gamification"" etc.Some courses have readings and activities, but most of the weight of the course is on the lectures. Some professors make videos really amazing, in different places, with spectacular backgrounds.And of course the boards, lots of stuff going on, trolling, flirting, some guys playing   know-it-alls, others complaining about peer review, some smart people making some smart comments, etc. Lots of action.And since the whole thing  works with   dates and deadlines there's a feeing of ""here and now"" very interesting.Meanwhile, other platforms of MOOCS, like saylor.org are less visual. They combine lectures from several universities, with lots of readings, but no peer assigments, and no deadlines, it's self paced, and there's barely no action in the f _rums.And the names of the courses follow a strict university terminology ""Intro math 101"", ""intro math 102"", ""intro math 103"", etc, it's all much more ""low profile"" than coursera, but   it's more similar to a real university semester course.So in other words: coursera is more visual, fun, exciting, (but you don  t learn  so much because you just enjoy the whole thing)   meanwhile saylor is more academic, boring, hard, (and you learn more at the end of the course, because there's less distractions )So I guess for a guy like me, with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder with no Hyperactivity) Saylor is the right  place   to study, and Coursera is better to take it in a more relaxed way, just watch the lectures, and have some fun.I wonder what people with ADD think about it. Can you really force yourself to work hard on a Coursera course? The only one I really made some effort on was in Introduction to Psychology by professor Smith, but the only reason was the OLI textbook that kept me focused on the subject...had not been for the OLI, I wouldnt have earned the certificate, I don  t feel motivated unless there's text , exercises with inmediate feedback, and strict, uniform  guidelines and rules. A more creative, open environtment like Coursera makes it harder to focus on the study.What do you think guys? Wanna share some thoughts on the subject?;"

I am doing English Literature   and Real World Math courses.;IF DEATH COULD WRITE.  Edgar Allan Poe was a child when he saw his mother perform Juliet  on stage. She died every single night, and we can only speculate what effect it had on young Edgar. But she entered the realm of death just a short while after, and Edgar realised that fiction and reality interact in random, chaotic ways.  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB when he was a teenager; his beloved Annabel ( who was also his cousin) also did. And even his own death was surrounded in fog, since it was not clear the cause. Some people claimed he was assaulted by criminals, other say he died after   several days on an alcohol binge, and there's even one version that said he was  forced by thugs to vote many times for a politician on voting day.  It's no surprising, then, that death plays such an important and pervading role in his writing. In my opinion, it was the way he had to  fight   the ghosts of so many loved ones gone. Anyone else, in similar circumstances, would have succumbed to so much horror; but he turned it into art.  He imitated   the random, unexpected way death knocks at the door. Death makes no sense, therefore the character in the Tell-Tale Heart seems to lack any sort of   reason to kill the old man. He hated his eye, as he could have hated a pimple   on his nose, or a gap on his teeth.A similar fashion is to be found in The Black Cat. Millions of people suffer alcoholism but they dont kill their wives  or torture their cats. The protagonist does. He does  follow the same logic that death seems to follow: everybody must pay a prize to be alive.  Poe wrote the stories that death herself would write if she could write.FORMpeer 1     The essay is well structured and easily read, attributing to its form. There aren't any significant grammar mistakes and major ideas are presented logically and in an orderly fashion.peer 2     The form is decent and I am marking you as meeting the standards. There are many opportunities for improvement. First, the thesis is not clear and I take it to be, ""He imitated  the random, unexpected way death knocks at the door."" This was toward the end of the essay, which left very little room for argument. Also, there are few small grammatical throughout. (e.g. ""It's no surprising"").peer 3     the overall form, structure and grammar, of the essay was good. the exposition of your argument was a little long but developed.peer 4     I did love that you added a creative ""title"" to your essay.

Your ideas are well- presented, so I don't have too much to say about form.peer 5     Easy to read, smooth grammar and style, well structured.CONTENTpeer 1     The content of the essay is interesting and provides the reader with some intriguing insights into the essence of the stories. Distinct concepts and arguments are divided and presented adequately and convincingly.peer 2     The content enriched my reading. I was familiar with most of Poe's biography that you listed, but I do think it is a key aspect in understanding why he wrote so much on the subject of death. Like my comments in form, I think you would have improved by reducing the biography, moving the thesis toward the beginning of the essay, and elaborated more deeply on how Poe used the subject of death in his writing.peer 3     Great argument, but needed more space i think for overall development.peer 4     I have one big issue with your argument. I think you gave too much space to the life of Poe. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't think that relying too much on an author's life is unnecessary. peer 5     Thanks for new information and interesting ideas.TOTAL SCORE: 4;Thanks, Efthymia.

Sorry for such a short review, I think it was late at night and I was a bit tired. Okay, let me add some comments now. People has been obsessing about things since the very start of humankind, we didn  t start obsessing about things in 1905 just when Freud came with his theory on fixation. I am not an expert on Freud, but didn  t he talk about ""oral fixation"" for people who were not properly breasfed as babies (so they became needy and fragile as adults) and anal retentive fixation for babies who did not play with their faeces, (so they became control freaks when they became adults). I am not sure of either Poe or Hawthorne could fall into that category.And wasnt   called ""id"" instead of ""it"" the cause of our instics and animal desires, and formed the whole mind, along with the Ego and Superego?Anyways, a great essay....just fixalitious.;Just a 3??? This eassy is original, creative and fresh, what a bunch of anal retentive reviewers.;Hola Florencia. As Laurie pointed out, lose and loose are different verbs, that's the main spelling mistake I got.Your thesis about the objectifization of women, and the economy used in the works is original and interesting,Hawthorne: subtracts, and loses his wife. Final score, -1.Poe: adds, loses his wife, gains a portrait. Final score, 0But I am not really sure they deliverately objectified their wifes....I think they got temporary insanity and the result was the death of their wives, and that causes them great pain, and proably spent the rest of their days regretting their foolish mistake,;I always title my essays. I think it makes the whole thing more clear and nice. If you start reading something with no title it seems like you are starting eating lunch by the main course...a title is an apetizer, it takes you by the hand and leads to you the essay, in a gentle way.Look for example  the title for  my last assigment: ""  If Death Could Write"". How suggestive, how many nuances, how many thoughts conveyed by 4 simple words. I should not say it, but I am a genius.;What about pre-coital games? Don  t tell me aint much better go slow, stopping here and there, so you go heating up the oven in a progressive way.;In two famous works , namely the novel The Day of the Triffids, by John Wyndham and Blindness, (film adaptation of a Jos   Saramago novel) there's several scenes of rape (in The Day of the Triddisds is very tuned down, just suggested, in Blindness is more graphic). Both scenarios depict a world where most of the population becomes blind.  The few remaining   men who can see, have a limitless source of  sex, since most women are blind and become mere toys at their hands.This is a negative forecast of what could happen if something like this happened in real life, on a massive scale.A similar negative view could be the Lord of the Flies by William Goldwin    , which was a response to the positive Coral Island, where a bunch of kids stranded on a deserted island help each other and cooperate til rescue comes.William Goldwin thought this positive view was utopic, and real life is predatory and unforgiving, and when things go tough, only the most cruel, reptilian type of people   survive.In The Land of he Blind by HG Wells there was no rape...but the guy certainly tried to take advantage of the situation, and sooner or later some sort of tradegy would unfold.So guys, what you think, we live in a potencial Coral Island, or in a Lord of the Fies society?;I forgot to include The Invisible Man, What do you think most people would do if they were invisible?;""you might find Kraken Wakes a bit annoyingly British at the beginning - it is quite terribly tiffin and tea - also a very good book though - us Brits do excel at end-of-the-world stuff ;p.

I loved my visits to   London and Brighton, and I got Aberdeen in my agenda for next year. Well, I find people like the guys of Top Gear obnoxious, (they made a beep in my radar when they made those comments about Mexicans) and I almost got beaten up to a pulp once in a British pub (in my own city, by the way), for daring to say ""calm down my friend   "" to a drunken guy who was staring at me agressively...since then I just tend to avoid eye contact with groups of ultra violent hooligans in pubs.;Thanks, Elizabeth. Yes, I agree that life is a roulette, inpredictable, and you can find both the best and worse at walking distance, I guess it's just a matter of attitude, the bottle can look half full or empty depending on each ones mindset.I am gonna add The Kraken Wakes and The Chrysalids to my agenda, I was a teenager when I read The Day of the Triffids, I guess reading it again wont hurt.;Interesting, John.

They are much more durable and I can put them on the shelves so I can actually see them.  ;Thanks for sharing, they sound interesting! I just placed the first 2 issues on hold at the library, even though I probably shouldn't be adding to my reading list right now :)  ;I would think Utopian is most certainly fantasy, as it is in itself a dream or a vision or aspiration for something better. I touched on utopia/dystopia briefly in uni and really enjoyed the concepts. One of my favourite movies; A Clockwork Orange looks at the concept of Dystopia well. To be honest I cant remember the titles of the other texts we read, will have to dig them up from the back of my bookshelf! But Im always open to new titles to check out ;Now that I am in my fifties and I have a teenage son, I love YA dystopia. In my younger years I read everything that came along the best seller list. I read everything that was labeled ""classic."" I gorged on Stephen King horror books, and I had a Harlequin romance subscription! Yes, don't laugh...I received a free wine glass with every book. Finally, I found my true loves: John Steinbeck, Native American authors, and creative nonfiction. But science fiction, especially wild dystopias, hold a spell over me. They are titillating because they just might come true. They weave in the possible with the impossible in such a spellbinding morbid way. As in the Hunger Games, we visit isolated communities based on a class system with people raised to perform certain hideous tasks. It is reminiscent of our society today: theme schools for the poor, isolated neighborhoods without services, wild packs of dogs attacking pedestrians, and health care for the rich. Dystopias are like a scream for help, and they captivate us with their injustice. Maybe they are not shelved in the library with science fiction, but they certainly contain the concepts.;Me three.;I've not read or seen The Hunger Games (though I did read a brilliant essay on how the series, and other novels, reinforce false ideas about violence and trauma on combat veteran-turned-peace activist Paul K Chappell's website). People I know who've done so all enjoyed the books, but seemed fairly evenly split about the films.;I really enjoy Dystopian novels. Thanks for the recommendations in this thread! I have always considered Dystopian stories as fantasy because often the author identifies a main flaw in society and imagines what our world could become because of this flaw. For instance, The Giver is a very simple yet powerful Dystopian story. Many freedoms are taken from the people in order to keep them ignorant and controlled, yet they are taken care of. In our modern day society, people still struggle between finding the right balance between liberties and safety. If you are interested in Dystopian literature, this is truly a great novel to pick up.;Faith,There is also a fourth book now to finish out the quartet (""Son"") if you haven't read it. I found it to be a really great finish to what was already a great series by Lowry.;The concepts of Utopia/Dystopia seem to arise from the possibilities of future developments. We've always known as a species that technology could be our savior, or our downfall; and so it's interesting to explore both possibilities. As in most things I say, I'll reference Philip K. Dick as both the exception and the rule. In most of his more popular writings, he explored the dystopian repercussions of technologies that had already come and gone (which also side-steps the over explaining problem); and in some, he simply represented a surprisingly mundane world that happened to have odd technologies.;Going through my copy against the ones we're supposed to read I noticed I am missing a number of them. I have the B&N version with Introduction and Notes by Elizabeth Dalton.  One thing that was a bit weird was that this link lists it as Clever Else and my book lists it as Clever Alice. They're the same story, I checked. Is that just a translation thing? I also noticed that it's not Gretel in either version, it's Grethel. Hansel and Grethel as well as Clever Grethel.

It was so clever and very refreshing to see such a literary work in comic book format. They are few and far between, but thankfully, growing steadily in number!;Faith:   It's very interesting that you brought this up. I have been persuading educators to teach graphic novels for years. I even wrote two articles about this, one which was published in a local paper, and one which was published in my university newsletter. I have only taught Maus so far, and that's it. But I want to be able to teach American Born Chinese, V for Vendetta, Persepolis, and so many others. I am always pushing my reluctant readers to try some graphic novels in order to motivate them more.;I think rejection of comics comes from the view that picture books and fantasy as a combo are for younger audiences and that it is more ""Mature"" to read long novels like Lord of the Rings, or classic novels like the help.   I mean comics were thought of as a geek thing before digital art.   But comics are great learning material, not only for literary and artistic purposes, but also for things like philosophy.   And if we are throwing out suggestions of comics that aren't mainstream, Try ""The Sword"" from Image comics.;I love Fables, although I admit I stopped following it in about 2008. I'm very bad with keeping up with comics.I'll have to get back into the series sometime. Especially given that it's so rare for me to find a series whose art AND story I enjoy.;I scared the bejeezus out of myself at 7 by looking at Poe's Tales of Mystery & Imagination, and had quite a lot of sleepless, weeping nights over it; at 10, I read Dracula for the first time one night, and if my father hadn't gone to the bathroom and noticed my light on at 2am, I'd have stayed bolt upright in bed, too scared to move; at 34, I stayed up until my husband woke up at 4am and realised I hadn't come to bed yet because I'd overdosed on Lovecraft. I am an incredibly slow learner.As a kid, if the language was a bit beyond me, that was simple: Dictionary. But if the concepts were too far beyond me or made me uncomfy, the book was ditched quite quickly. I think I genuinely didn't get the Heinlein sex stuff as a youngster, so mentally shunted it aside, tore through the book and went on to the next. It wasn't until I went back years later that I was surprised. Perhaps each kid just takes from books what they can.  Mind you, I do remember as a pre-teen being very confused by the phrase ""the friendship of her thighs"" in my collection of Irish myths, and even more bewildered by my parents' reaction to my asking about it.  ;Yes, thank you for the essay.   In general, I think he makes good points.   In the specifics, however, I have quibbles over a couple of details.1) Women in combat. Previous generations of anthropologists automatically assumed that battle-graves held men, without bothering to check the pelvis for gender.   Americans have likely heard of Molly Pitcher.   Disney's Mulan is based upon a legendary Chinese figure.   Korea's Royal Court included women guards, who fought with fan and throwing knives.   Kathleen Hurley wrote a blog post, ""We have always fought: Challenging the Women, Cattle, and Slaves Narrative"" just last month, I recommend reading it.2) I can think of one movie that does include a character messing their pants in combat.   The ""Karate Kid"" remake (I call it ""Kung Fu Kid,"" since that's what this kid learns) with Will Smith's son, the brown at his pants was very clear in movie theaters, when the bullies gang up on him.;I am not quite sure honestly. I do love The Red Shoes though, not going to lie. Also, the movie. That movie is amazingly beautiful.  I tried to do some searching and I didn't come up with anything. I think I may dig deeper when I have the time. I'm curious now.;I wondered how I didn't have Cinderella in my book. I have heard that name for it, but not for a long time.  ;Do you mean the movie with Brandy in it from 1997?But really, is there one?;Ohhh. Cool! Thank you. :);Cinderella was always my favorite. I don't know why but I guess it had to do with the evil assholes, I mean, step-family finally getting theirs.  ;It's ok. I started singing Cinderella, Cinderella night and day it's Cinderella. It also doesn't help that I was in a production of it either.  ;I chime in for Neil Gaiman as well. I don't know if you watch Doctor Who or not but it's steered into the path of being fairy tale like. Especially Gaiman's episode, The Doctor's Wife. Stardust, of his, is also a fantastic fairy tale. I don't think it will ever really fade. There's always going to be an undercurrent of it.  ;Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Maiden, Mother and Crone. Goldy Locks and The 3 Bears.3 pops up in pretty much ever religion around the world, in some form or another.  People also tap out beats to start dance numbers or to be in sync with each other.  Third time's the charm. It's in sports and geography and music and almost anything you can think of. I don't know why but it's really interesting.  ;Numerology is an interesting beast.  ;To me it seems like abstract morals. Or doing 'bad' things for a good purpose. I'm not sure about what version you are reading but I've noticed that some things are more prominent in certain translations and absent in others. And these are tales of a different time and morals were different, people and the world were viewed different and some things that are important to us now, weren't then.  ;Well, a long time ago if a child disobeyed ,and by a long time I mean BCE, they were stoned to death. Children did what they were told and nothing more. You learned what you had to to be an obedient, productive member of society. Population was low. Disease was high and they needed everyone to follow orders. Also, people didn't have all of the understanding about our world. To them, the thunder really was caused by an angry God. So, that was to be feared above all else and sometimes the only way to instill that was violently.  ;Honestly, I read these versions of the fairy tales before I ever saw the Disney or ""happy"" versions of them. I wasn't really phased by it.  ;Oh, ok. I get what you're saying.  I think there is a moral to the story, it's just not so obvious and it's hidden in riddles and symbols. Some aren't apparent to us because of the time period. That's just how I view it.  ;This.  Very true. My french teacher in high school talked to us about that when we studied Beauty and The Beast, as it's a French fairy tale.  ;I started trying to read, by myself, at around 2 years old. I would attempt to read everything, cereal boxes, shampoo bottles, the milk jug. My grandma realized that and got me materials that would teach me and I've been reading ever since.She did read to me and she would always make up a story to put me to sleep at night. It always involved me and I was a great adventurer and I defeated all of the bad people and saved the day. I loved those stories, they sparked my imagination and made me believe I could do anything. I guess it really stayed with me. I don't think that all children are drawn to stories or reading. My sister is the exact opposite, despite our early attempts to get her to read. She still has no interest in it. She didn't like bedtime stories and preferred to draw in the books I gave her. I guess it just didn't spark her imagination. With all of my cousins, who are like brothers and sisters, I watched the scenario play out. Some love it and some don't, despite the same household and the love of reading around them. Really interesting. Not everyone is geared towards words.;I can totally see that. I love Alice and anything that spins off. Definitely one of my favorite stories. But I always saw the Doctor as more of a Merlin character. Yay! Whovians.  ;Having read a lot of these in my younger years, it doesn't particularly affect me. I mean, I notice it but I don't really have a problem with it. It was a different time period. I can't hate them for that. I think someone mentioned Tom Sawyer and how they use the ""N"" word. Well, when we had to read that our junior year we had to say 'man' instead of it. Which really made me mad because we are reading a piece of work from a time when that was considered ok. Do we really have to sanitize it? Coming from a mixed family, it's just a world and unless you try and put meaning behind it...it's just a word and these are just someone elses views and they're dead now. But discussing them is very interesting. Sadly though, we still see the bigotry in our modern world and some things haven't changed.  ;She really was. Anytime something controversial came up it was glossed over and explained away. It was really disheartening.  ;Who knows and we probably never will. But remember, at that time, a man of his age courting an 11 year old wasn't weird. It's weird now and we call it pedophilia but 50 year old men used to marry 9 year old girls. So, I feel like this is a moot point when reading his work. If you want to nit pick and pull out sources and say ""Yes! this man wanted to mess around with little girls"" that's fine but I think it detracts from his work. Even if he was attracted to them and it wasn't appropriate, I don't believe he ever actually did anything.  ;The same was said about J.M. Barrie because he loved Sylvia Llewelyn Davies boys. Children can be inspiring.  ;I just did a google search and I couldn't find anything official but a lot of people say she is supposed to be 7 years old. I had always heard 5.  ;"

When it comes to grading of content, following advice is given: ""Since everyone can learn to write better, at least 10% but no more than 30% of the grades should be 1. Most people will offer their readers a new insight and some detailed reference to the text that argues for the significance of that insight and for an appreciation of how that detail functions, so most essays will enrich our reading and earn a 2. Some essays will be astonishingly new or persuasive or useful by making the story much richer and even by helping you understand better how to read stories in general. Such essays earn a 3 in Content, but no more than 20% of the grades should be a 3 because, by definition, ""outstanding"" is comparatively rare. Most grades should be 2.""  Should I grade based on the insight and new knowledge the essay has given me or how it would affect other readers in general?    From the essays I'm assigned to grade, two of them don't offer some new insight or enrich my understanding of the Grimm stories in general (or a specific one) while one of them interprets a story in a particular but quite obvious and mundane way.  Maybe I shouldn't worry too much as I'm not the only one giving a grade but I'd still like to be as honest and objective as I can in considering the value of each essay.

Thanks to all peers for their replies. :)War of the WorldsStoker's Dracula is, at it's core, a story about struggle between the world of old, represented by Count Dracula, and the modern world, represented by the Harkers, Dr. Seward, Quincey Morris, and Lord Godalming, while the character of dr. Van Helsing acts as a mediator between the two since he's equally embracing old practices and the achievements of modern science.Carpathia is a land far to the east, belonging to the part of the world that is, at the time the novel was written, thought to be underdeveloped and uncivilized, and somehow exotic at the same time.It is no wonder then that Jonathan Harker, on his way to castle Dracula, observes natural beauty of dark pine woods and dangerous mountain passages, encounters wolves, superstitious gypsies, and other symbolic representations of the dark ages when the world was chaotic. While one might acknowledge the existence of such place, it is always quite remote and there's no fear it will come into contact with the civilized and ordered modernity.Once the Count decides to cross the border between the two, perceived order is quickly shaken as unfathomable things happen and modern Londoners don't know how to respond properly or what to make of the seemingly unrelated events. They're visibly alarmed but they're refusing to believe into something they can't explain logically, that is, until Van Helsing arrives and brings the means and the ancient knowledge to fight back against the otherworldly foe. With Helsing's genius that is able to merge the old with the new - mysticism with science - heroes are able to fight off the fiend that threatens to destroy their world and restore the order and conformity of the modernity once more.Form: 2peer 1     Your sentences are clear and grammatically correct, and your argument is laid out pretty clearly.peer 2     Good structure of the text with a clear introduction and conclusion.

Bravo!peer 4     The content was very good. The notion of old and new was very well explained and laid out with concrete examples.

Unfortunately, word limit prevented me from explaining it in greater detail, so I'll post the essay here and add brief comments afterwards.Monsters of our MindsFrankenstein's monster is the personification of burning ambition to fulfill some greater goal we feel to be destined for, and all the fears, doubts, and desires - the horrific apparitions conjured in our minds - that torment us and lead to destruction if we allow ourselves to leave them unchecked. This ambition, the real monster of the story, may exist only within the mind of Victor Frankenstein.  From the moment we witness Frankenstein's success in creating life - giving form to his ambition - he is constantly in refusal of the responsibility he has towards this creature, himself, and the mankind. He flees and leaves it unchecked, allowing it to creep behind the scenes of rational world and grow in secrecy, only to return to the surface and deliver doom to the ones he cares for and to himself. Soon after the agreement to fulfill creature's wants for a companion, he realizes his world would be in danger and overrun by their demonic offspring, and finding there's no easy escape, he decides to take control and extinguish the monster within himself, by chasing it all over the - metaphorical inner - world. Understanding the dangers of ambition, he warns Walton against pursuing his own goal, to leave it be and to escape his own downfall. It is no wonder then that the only other person in the story to explicitly see Frankenstein's monster is Walton himself, as the two possess the ambition, know it, and can understand one another; suddenly, the creature is manifested before his eyes - the ugly ambition that drove his friend to death, one he won't follow.""But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go"" [1] says Frankenstein, after contemplating previous encounter with the monster, and sends us subtle message that no matter how far we run, our monsters will follow for they are part of us - we gave them life and in cursing them, we curse ourselves.Works cited: [1] Shelley, M.; Frankenstein; Collins Classics, 2010; page 138, paragraph III.Grade: 2 + 2.5 = 4.5My take was that the Monster represents Frankenstein's ambition. It might not exist in the physical world as separate entity but it may manifest, in a moment of clarity, before those who have their own ambitions and are determined to pursue them no matter the cost, such as Frankenstein and Walton who are similar in many aspects yet Walton finally decides to abandon his pursuit after he sees what he might come to if he persists.  Killings mentioned in the book, from my perspective, are symbolic. If we look closer, we'll see William, Clerval, and Elizabeth are suffocated - Frankenstein's ambition is suffocating, overbearing, and he loses them to it. This might merely be a separation, not death. His father, on the other hand, might really have died in the novel, brought down by the dissolution of the family through his son's ambition.  I'm not yet sure how Justine's death may be explained with this analysis.Comments?;Monsters of our MindsFrankenstein's monster is the personification of burning ambition to fulfill some greater goal we feel to be destined for, and all the fears, doubts, and desires - the horrific apparitions conjured in our minds - that torment us and lead to destruction if we allow ourselves to leave them unchecked.

Good points. peer 3     This essay shows a deep understanding of the symbolic meaning of ambition in Shelley's masterpiece, demonstrating not only that it is a constant in the narratives, but also that it allows the reader to realize that the monster, Victor and Walton are doppelgangers.peer 4     Nice concept but I still confuse to some ideaAdditional comments:  peer 1     All in all, good work!peer 2     I really liked your essay because it gives me a deeper understanding of my own reading of the book. I think you're right in saying that the world in which Frankenstein hunts his ""monster"" is a metaphorical ""inner world"", and in more than one sense: for the monstrosity of the creature is none other than the monstrosity of Frankenstein and humanity itself - the creature only mirrors the attitudes of others towards him. Thus, the true monster of the novel - and the true warning it gives - is not against that what is inhuman - for it wasn't the creature's inhuman shape or powers that made it cruel and filled with vice. Rather, its against humans monstrosity itself, in its contradictory ambition to go beyond its own limits, while simultaneously rejecting all that is different and unknown to themselves. That's why humans are not suited to be creators, according to this reading. In other essay, the author claimed that the creature represents technology, and I also see that as a fit reading to enrich this interpretation. For man's ""creature"" is none other than technology; and it's through technology that he hopes to go beyond the limitations of his human condition and achieve dominion over life and death. However, the pride that leads him to ambition overcoming his limitations is the same pride that leads him to be selfish and prejudiced against that which is created by him, and thus enter in a conflict with its creature that leads to the destruction of both. Thus, the monster that humanity faces isn't that of what is inhuman, but it's own inner monstrosity, which is the sole responsible for whatever monstrosity its creature has. peer 4     In general it give me more view point to look the Frankenstein novel.I really appreciate peers who invested some time to write additional comments and particularly to peer 2 who decided to expand on the essay with his/ her own ideas. Peer 3's comment on Form is really flattering. :)  This grade is an improvement as previous essays were graded with 4, and even more so since I didn't manage to include everything I had in mind to support the thesis.

Searching for terms like    one   ,    two   ,    three    and so on until    twenty   , we come to discover that there are seven numbers that show up as the most used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12. The other numbers appears no more than six times.One can suppose a religious motivation behind these numbers. The number    one   , for example, could be a reference to God, the pairs could point to the divine/human duality of Christ, the triples, to the Trinity. We don't think so. Maybe these references may be true, but we think they come from the before Christ era, from ancient Greek philosophy.Most of the Grimms' tales were collected from European oral tradition, so it's valid to believe that they can have a BCE origin. Such numeric citations resemble a reference to Pythagorean and Platonic numerology. The pythagoreans had as a doctrinal central point a figure formed by piling the first four numbers to form a triangle, and triangles were also basic in Plato's cosmology. Seven and twelve can point respectively to the number of heavenly bodies known in Antiquity and the signs of zodiac. One can point that there were eight heavenly bodies, including the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, but in the Grimms' tales there is also an eighth character to complete the number, as in The Wolf and the Seven Kids or even the man that blows the seven windmills.We think the reason why this numerology is present in the tales is that ancient folks believed that exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence. Not only the content of the tales would be worth of learning but the mere listening would bring good luck to the listener. Kind of an aesthetic soteriology, where being exposed to sacred symbols and rituals can bring salvation.Works cited:  The central point defended in my essay comes from Metaphysics classes I've taken from Prof. Glenn W.

Next time around try to leave out the stuff that is obvious and the stuff you are not going to use (Christian numerology, which really was just a strategy to include pre-Christian beliefs into christianity in Order to gain power) but explain your thesis better by giving examples. Be concrete.peer 3      There are some grammatical inconsistencies, such as spelling a number at one point (""twelve"") and not at another point (""12""). The argument does proceed logically, though, and in a way that makes sense.peer 4      Great elucidation of surprisingly profound ideas which manage to avoid both simplicity and difficult argot. It is a pity that there is such a stringent word limit as you obviously have more to contribute regarding this topic, and you leave the reader wanting more. That said, your form could be slightly more fleshed out. In terms of redaction, you are good but would definitely profit from some practice. For example, sentences like this one should be completely revised: ""Not only the content of the tales would be worth of learning but the mere listening would bring good luck to the listener."" As you can see, there is a slight misuse of words and it is somewhat redundant.Overall evaluation (CONTENT) - Grade 2peer 1      I like how deep you analyzed this theme.

As such, the essay seems to only just skim over ideas rather than exploring them in depth.peer 4      Your content definitely merits a perfect score despite the fact that, unfortunately, you obviously did not have enough space to flesh out your ideas with as much thoroughness as you desired and which your essay definitely deserved. It was a pleasant surprise to see useful references to numerology and metaphysical issues without witnessing a diversion from this unit's theme, and that doubtlessly merits recognition. In a short essay, you managed to convey innovative ideas without straying from the thematic core. Very admirable!Comments:  peer 4      Excellent content that, unfortunately and due to the course's requirements, feels a bit cut short. I would definitely advise working on the form of your writing for a smoother reading.

I think that what we may be discussing comes down to the difference(?) between speculative science-fiction, and what I'll call fantasy science-fiction. Speculative seeks to answer what's going on, with either science or pseudo-science. Fantasy seeks to have fun with concepts that aren't scientifically present. My wording could use a lot of work - I haven't spoken to intelligent people in entirely too long! Thanks, all.;Thank you very much Theo.After I read your comment I went looking for that tale, because I didn't remember reading it. But it isn't in the edition I have. Regardless, I remembered this other tale called Hans in Luck, in which the main character Hans is a servant and described as being a person of much luck.What I found in common between this tale and the one you mentioned, is that luck is an attribute that makes the character different from all the rest and that will help them succeed in the story (although in Hans case it seems like an ironic kind of Luck), almost like a skill. When it comes to princes and king's sons, on the other hand, they are never described as being lucky, it is just implicit in the story. If the hero of the tale is a prince you know things will be okay just because he showed up. Even when the prince is put in danger, something will happen that will lead him to a happy ending. On the other hand, if the hero is a low born, be him lucky, smart, strong... you will have to keep reading to know what he will do to overcome his difficulties.In the end, I think the big difference is when the hero is high born you'll learn what happened to him, while when the hero is low born you'll learn what he had to do.Does this sound coherent at all?  ;Hi Theo, I appreciate your response, and I do see what you say, but fantasy in general provides that escape from the known usual, and yet deviating this much from causality is not at all accepted in other fantasy sub-genres. And besides, Grimm tales are far from safe haven, at least for my taste. Some of them, like the Death of the Hen, or the youth who went to learn about fear, make the horror genre shy. And still I can't put them down. I think what Rebecca said is definitely part of it, and what you say is part of it. But I fancy, there must be more.Thanks;"

I bring you my essay to read, so that you may laugh, cry, bang your head repeatedly against a wall asking why you ever decided to read my essay, and  ponder your very existence.   In the nineteenth century, women were seen through a cloud of stereotypes. In his novel    Dracula    Bram Stoker portrays women as social, subservient to men, and unable to resist the temptations of men.  In Lucy Westerna   s letter to Mina Harker, she talks about how she and Mina have    told all our secrets to each other since we were children    (Pg. 52) and    eaten together, and laughed and cried together    (Pg. 52). Women are shown as social beings that thrive on social interaction. In Dracula   s castle, there are three female vampires who live with Dracula. These women represent the subservience of women toward men:   they are the servants of Count Dracula, kept forever in the darkness of his castle. Dracula   s ability to change his victims into slaves is another allusion to the subservience of women; all of his victims are women.   Finally, women are portrayed as unable to resist the temptations of men.   In the castle, as Dracula is defending Jonathan Harker from three vampire women, he is accused of being unable to love, to which he responds    Yes I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past    (Pg. 37), which shows that he was able to tempt them into being vampires by making love to them. When Mina and Van Helsing are in the forest, the vampire women call to Mina, asking her to join them. Stoker makes a point to show that if Van Helsing had not been there, Mina would have succumbed to temptation, and would have ended as a vampire herself.   In conclusion, Stoker gave the women in his novel these traits in order to craft them into perfect victims for a sexual predator like Dracula. He made them dependent so that they would need a man in their life, subservient so that they would obey Dracula when he caught them, and unable to resist temptation so that Dracula could easily catch them.   ;Ratka, I'm really sorry you feel this way. I have unfortunately said some things that match the comments that you find intolerable.

Are modern fairytales still stories we can tell children without any fear that they'll be horrified or disturbed when wolf eats up grandmother?;I quite agree with what you say about homemade fairy tales; in my part of the world, children and adults likewise have a whole horde of fairy tales and fantasy sagas that are actually instilled in them- our bed-time stories always involve Indian folktales and hardly ever Snow White. In fact i vaguely remember hardly being able to relate to these when i was a child encountering the Grimm brothers for the first time. Fairy tales do have to have some connection to the present society. Of course, movies are a whole new world of fairy tales, ET, Lion King, Narnia..there is happily no end to them, and they continue being made all the time. It is perhaps in the movies that fairy tales are evolving the most.;"

From other classes in Coursera I realized that it really helps to share your essay with the whole class since you get to read and learn more.  Let me take this opportunity   to thanks my reviewers, and here goes my essay along with my peer's comment: (*be kind!*)Tracing Spirituality, Religion, and Myth in Grimms    Tales(With special reference to  Hansel and Grethel,  Little Red Cap and Little Thorn Rose  or  Sleeping Beauty)The Grimms brothers collected and wrote down folktales that had a distinctive German flavour. However, the well-read and religious Whilhelm who fleshed out most of the Grimms    fairy tales, included much of his own faith (Christianity), nationalistic feelings (Old Norse and German myths), and education (Roman and Greek myth) within the stories.In  Little Red Cap  for instance, the girl is given bread and wine to take to her grandmother, which is distinctively Eucharist and is meant to revitalize. This is very different from Charles Perrault   s version where it   s just bread and butter. The red cap signifies sexual maturity but it is also the colour of Pentecost, and so later the child learns that if she goes    off the path    she will    fall.      The wolf encounter is the child   s test of faith and resolve. She tells the wolf that grandmother lives in a house    under three great oak trees...    The oak, in Germanic mythology is sacramental since it is a place of sacrifice to the god Woden. To this, Grimms added the triune God of Christianity.The frog in  Sleeping Beauty  that emerges from water (signifying both Christian rebirth and pagan    time flow   ) is an amphibious    double natured    being and hence magical. Like the white duck in  Hansel and Grethel, the frog can comfortably cross the boundaries between two worlds, and helps people to do the same (water and land).The Christian motif of rebirth is seen time and time again through the works of the Grimm brothers. At the beginning of  Sleeping Beauty,    the queen was seated bathing  _      where the Grimms associate    bath,    with baptism     a rebirth that according to them not only washes away ones sins but also removes its mortal consequence. This motif recurs in  Hansel and Grethel  when they are required to cross the river.Such mythical, religious, and even psychological symbols woven intricately in Grimms    fairy tales vouch for their enduring appeal through the centuries.

Anon, thanks for your valuable, anonymous (and hence meaningful and unanimous?) instruction on Internet etiquette. My off-line life necessitates me to sleep if it   s past 3 am in the morning, and I think that   s what I will stick to, even if   hurts a few people   s fragile sentiments.  ;Thank you, Anon. I agree the peer review process frustrates a lot of us, but I guess as Emma Fry pointed out in another thread, it   s best to gracefully accept and learn from the comments we agree with and completely disregard the ones that we vehemently oppose. Considering we have to go through this process 10 times in the coming weeks, I believe that   s the best course of action for our peace of mind as well as our learning curve!  Coming back to your essay, I quite like the parallels you drew with the kings of yore. Indeed it   s widely accepted today that the brothers did not create the materials of their work, but rather collected them. Prof. Rabkin mentions this quite extensively in one of the lectures including how Wilhelm wove in his nationalist sentiments into the fabric of his fairy tales.   In The Frog Prince, we can also draw connections with the Greek story of Atlanta and the golden apples (Prof. Rabkin   s lecture). Personally, I also thought of the golden ball of thread Ariadne gives to Theseus so that he can defeat the Minotaur     representing the other spectrum where the ball instead of reflecting sexual maturity goes on to become a symbol of revealing the way (of knowledge).   Finally, like the others above, I quite like your essay. Thanks for sharing.;By the time I came to    So it came to be that the big princess (really???)   were having an unwanted child...    I was cracking up so hard that I almost spilled my coffee over the laptop! I am really afraid I would end up giving you very high score just because you dared to do this. I love it!  Actually in a twisted way your essay does enrich one   s reading of the stories     the commentary on society, the twisted sense of justice seen in the Grimms    stories are all there in your, umm.. essay (?);Ah, there you go Joseph!

In fact, believe it or not, when I read about the part where you can include a poem or a short story as a part of your creative your essay, I thought about you and how  you  can use that to your advantage!;Thanks Florence for sharing your essay. By exploring the importance of written and said words in what is essentially a reinvention of word-of-the-mouth stories, your essay hinges on a very important facet about this week   s reading. As for the form, I can   t agree with your peers     you use a good structure (the tab before your paragraphs is actually the right way of writing an academic essay that I did not follow. Peer 2   s comment,      If ""it shouldn   t surprise us much"", when why bother. Why write an essay on the obvious (sic)?    seems pointless, honestly and seems to completely miss the point that it   s a style of writing rather than a commentary on the fact that all readers will make this connection between the importance of words and the fairy tales.   Also, I believe you did a good job by choosing to discuss the    underground    tales as my peer commented.  ;Daniel, this is a very good essay. You seem to have received good peer comments on your essay as well. Congratulations on a work very well done.  ;Anthony, I understand what you mean when you say you did not have a lot of time to prepare for your essay. I audited this course last time around and I remember I joined in Week 2 and I was meant to write the essay on Unit 2. Believe it or not, I had ten minutes left on the countdown before submission     I kid you not!  And because I thought I would fight through the course, I wrote an essay in 8 mins and clicked submit. I got a 4.5!! I think I was just plain lucky. Of course I could not keep up with the course last time around due to various personal reasons, but the point is, you can do a good enough job even if you are in a hurry.   Coming to your essay, the first thing that I noticed when I saw your essay was that you got really long peer feedback, which is a good thing. You have a very good opening line, but as a peer comments, your opening line and your exposition about how words    serve to bookmark and separate the story's different stages    are slightly at odds. Indeed I am pointing this out because I think you have a really strong theme to your essay and you have chosen very apt examples to elucidate your points     a few alternations here and there could make this an excellent essay (which I think you would have anyway done if you had more time to review). Overall, I would give you a 4.5 or 5 and definitely not a 4. Thanks for sharing!;Claire, it's great to see familiar people in this course. (We are in Prof. Peter's class too). I follow your blog because I quite like your style of writing, the extra images/information that you include there and this essay of yours was no different. I enjoyed reading it! Like one of your peers mentioned, I did not notice how often the symbol of feet and shoes have been used in the story, and indeed it's interesting how it's so important for the price to find the right 'fit.'  ;Just a quick note to others in the course: People, please share your thoughts on the essays posted here. Unlike the other courses I have participated before, this time around we do not have a lot of people participating in this discussion. The last time around I audited the course, there were a huge number of people discussing each of the essays - it really helps to widen one's ideas.  ;Johsua and Masako, I am afraid it does seem tedious to read the books now, but as Daniel and Anthony puts it, give it another go with an open mind. Even better, I guess you should read up a bit on the works before you go back to the books - check out the various interpretations of the work and what it really means.I know a girl who has a tattoo of the Cheshire Cat on her.

Thanks a ton!!Frankenstein   s    Monster   : A Product of Nurture, Not Nature           Psychologists and literary scholars alike have cried themselves hoarse through the years over the question of nature versus nurture affecting human actions. What is it that makes one commit crimes? Is his brain really    abnormal    as the 1931 film  Frankenstein  would have us believe (1) or is he merely a product of his society   s atrocities (2)?           If we are cued onto the subtle signs in Shelley   s novel, we realize that the character of Victor Frankenstein   s Creature serves to answer this debate. Shelley defies the moral sense of monstrosity that was prevalent in the Renaissance literature (3) and uses the same idea of    monster    to show how the society was responsible for making him the    fiend    he eventually became.           At the beginning, the Creature tries to fit into the society where he finds himself abandoned. Yet, he meets with only disgust, fear, and hatred because of his    unearthly...ugliness    (P153) (4). Finally, after months of nurturing love for the DeLacy family and silently acting as their    good spirit,    the Creature gathers up the courage to earn    happiness...forever.       Do not you desert me...    (P91) he  beseeches   the old man, but is hit again.         Shunned by his own creator and later by these    protectors,    the Creature is left with a raging abhorrence for all of society. Yet, he does not enjoy killing (5). Murdering is a    deadly torture    for him, flamed by his    bitter indignation    and    insatiable thirst for vengeance    at being repeatedly failed.           While this does not absolve him of all crimes, we realize that the Creature, who is not even afforded a name, has been deserted from the moment of creation. From this betrayal emanates his anger. Lack of understanding, tutelage, and love created the    Monster    who was merely a hideous Creature with potential before.         Thus while the Prometheus of yore brought fire to mankind and helped them, Frankenstein, the    Modern Prometheus    did nothing to help his creation or mankind. And so in the    torturing flames    of fire ends the life of the misunderstood and mistreated Creature.  Works cited:Shelly, Mary.  Frankenstein. Ed:Paul Hunter. Norton Critical Edition.

Universal Production, September 1931(2)      I am malicious because i am miserable; am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?    (P 98)(3)   Monsters in the eighteenth century were a literary symbol for vice. And as Samuel Johnson writes:    Vice...should always disgust.   (4)      I had sagacity enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who formerly beheld me.

For the most part, the grammar is proficient and the vocabulary effective. A couple of things I thought I would point out: 1. This sentence actually doesn't make sense. It's missing a word or two, I think: ""over the question of nature versus nurture affecting human actions."" 2. In the sentence ""Is his brain really    abnormal   "" you use what I call a vague pronoun. It's not clear who you mean by ""his."" When you use pronouns, be sure it's clear to the reader who or what the pronoun refers to. 3. You use the word ""besieges"" when I think you mean ""beseeches."" 4. ""at being repeatedly failed"" is unclear. Again, it seems incomplete. Overall, though, the writing is clear and effective. With some simple editing, it could be clearer.peer 3      Well written.

I think it was very clever of her (if I remember right) to do that - especially considering how difficult the word count is for us. Hope no one marked me down for that!;Try Canvas network. I did this course called Gender Through Comic Book that finished last month. Prof. Blanch was amazing and the course was really lively and very different from the usual stuff. Right now Michigan State University has a course here  that might also interest a few of you.  ;I had noticed that symbolism too. But I am still struggling to understand the deeper meaning behind the paper origami. Any thoughts?  ;Actually go ahead and write that. I have been planning to watch Technicolor Time Machine for sometime, and till I get to that, it would be good to read about your thoughts. It would be a good change!  ;I did say watch didn't I? I meant read.  I was actually going to watch a silly TV series that I downloaded before I wrote that post. So getting to watch that was on my mind of something and I have terrible forum etiquette - I never re-read my posts. Well now with that out of the way, I have in fact (unfortunately) watched Hot Tub Time Machine and I wish I had not. I have never watched the Pal version of War of the Worlds, but I think the musical was really well done. I came across the album long time back when a friend thought I  have  to get a taste of it. He thought somehow because I am into books and listen to rock sometimes, I would automatically ""dig it"" (and I did!).  Speaking Tom Cruise's WoW, did you find any similarity with the recent Man of Steel in the conception of some of the sequences? Assuming you have already watched it?;You get a lot of down votes, Javier. I remember a storm in one of the forums where you were involved too. You enjoy this, don't you? But parents were divorced and stuff? I mean what has that got to do with anything? It's like saying I colored my hair green because I flew economy!  ;I got an essay which mentions quite a bit about Miller's work, and obviously I did not know about the work. However, the author made a good effort to quote from the work and showed how it is relevant to her essay. I did not mark him/her down at all for that. Would not be fair at all, it seemed me.  ;"

I had this nagging feeling that there's more to the origami but I never could form a coherent idea as to why I think it's important! So thanks for talking about your thoughts.  ;Javier! Death is most definitely a he! :D Okay, sorry that was just random. Now about your essay's content. I have read a few essays by you in the discussion threads, and I believe your style is consistently improving with each essay - at this rate, you would be rocking by Week 10!  Some of the sentence structures are slightly uncomfortable, but nothing that a revision cannot correct. For example:  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB when he was a teenager; his beloved Annabel ( who was also his cousin) also did. And even his own death was surrounded in fog, since it was not clear the cause  could be written as  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB (maybe in literature it's better to write  tuberculosis)when he was a teenager. He also lost his  beloved and  cousin,  Annabel. His own death too  was  surrounded in fog a fog of mystery.  (You should have written ""since the cause was not clear""  however since in the next sentence you go on to hash out the various theories surrounding his death, that sentence is self-evident)Now those are just my opinion. Overall, a very good attempt. Thanks for sharing and starting the thread.;Sean, some male authors and graphic novel writers saying Death is a woman does not make it true! Uh... I dunno why I am arguing over this! The fact is, the more I think about this, the more I like the idea of Death being her. More power to us.In Hindu mythology Kali is sort of the goddess of Death and Destruction. But so is his consort Shiva (male). Again they come together as ardhyanariswer,  which basically means half-man and half-woman and becomes one. Evidently the Greeks having a male god in Hades makes the whole thing more confusing. I think I will just stick with Rowling's soul-less Dementors with no confusing sex.Btw, the William Hartnell reference was so lost on me. :|;Please don't apologize, Sean!    I  am sorry if my comment seemed like I took offense! I took it absolutely lightly. In fact, like I said,   it would be fun if Death is supposed to be a woman. But then, that's just if we think of Death philosophically or in a literary way. In reality, no matter  who or what  death is, it's just painful - be it death of animals, family, or a homeless person.Oh and I think it's unfair on the third gender if we leave them out as a part of the discussion. I believe that's why   we have the hermaphrodite  deity in Hindu mythology. I agree with you when you say gods are quite gender-fluid in a way. Interesting thought about Ganesha. Not sure if he is the god of science (though I cannot boast I know all about the myths of the East). He is however, the original scribe and it is said that he wrote the whole of  Mahabharata  at one go, with Vsaya   (the real author) dictating it to him. Umm... I am sorry if that's too much information! Myth always excites me. I had a huge Greek and Roman mythology phase when I was in school, and a Chinese and Celtic phase when I was in College. :DBtw, I was definitely not slighting  Sandman. How can I? I recently got into graphic novels, and I am waiting to get my hands on the complete series. Just completed  Blankets  and  Building Stories. Thanks for explaining the Hatrnell reference. I feel so bogged down at time when I realize  all  the things I have to finish reading and know about!@Anon -  I agree. Though Yamraj  is also supposed to be a man. People around the world have really been confused about this for centuries (like most things)!;I like your Peer 1. I want him/her as my peer next time. :D I agree with what this peer had to say about your essay. Nice work - I am afraid I don't have much to add in the way on constructive criticism.  ;Lovely! Thank god some of us remember to have fun while doing this course. Hope you got something above 5 for this.  PS: I know who you are. :D Why the Anonymous post, bard?;Here's my essay. I wish I could write more on this theme. I completely agree with the corrections Peer 3 makes in the ""form"" section. Thank you for noting them down. Thanks Peer 4 for your opinion in the ""content"" section. I agree I could have discussed the social context of the period in more detail, but we just have 320 words!! And I was more interested in hashing out the whole pop culture reference! Also, I agree with Peer 1. On second thoughts, I should definitely have referenced Poe's Black Cat too.PS: I am making some of the minor corrections that my peers have mentioned, and having the conger   version of my citation, which I could not submit. Look forward to your comments.__________Women in Refrigerators Syndrome in Hawthorne   s WorkThe term    Women in Refrigerators    was coined by Gail Simone, an American comic book writer (1) who noticed how too many women in the comic world are randomly killed off by the author to further the plot. Most often than not, in these comics, the woman is the love interest of the hero and when the villain kills the woman, it helps the revenge motif plays out. The women thus become playthings in the hands of the author and protagonist     a plot mechanism that has been severely censured by feminist critics.Hawthorne   s men of science in    The Birthmark,       Rappaccini   s Daughter,    and    Dr. Heidegger   s Experiment,    each have a woman in the background. In a slight twist to the pop cultural Women in Refrigerators syndrome, the hero here is also the villain and their women are killed off to satisfy their own medieval alchemist-like urges.Dr. Heidegger   s lady    swallowed one of her lover   s prescriptions and died,    triggering off his somewhat dark career filled with stories of sorcery. Though not explicitly mentioned, the woman dies because of Heidegger and this makes him a lonely, obsessed, and cruel man. Indeed his experiment on his friends was hurtful and emotionally damaging to them. One can imagine that the similarly obsessed Aylmer who in spite of knowing his failures proceeded to remove Georgiana   s birthmark will eventually transform into another Dr. Heidegger     a bitter, old, twisted, and cunning man with no regard for human life and friends.  Rappaccini   s daughter too is simply a tool to be manipulated by his father and later her Italian lover and Signor Baglioni, her father   s rival.In all these three stories, the women have no role other than playing the morally upright and sacrificial maidens who are then metaphorically stuffed in the refrigerator so that the experiments, rivalries, and stories of the men can be played out.Bibliography(1)     Women in Refrigerators (or WiR) is a website that was created in 1999 by a group of comic book fans. The website features a list of female comic book characters that had been injured, killed, or depowered as a plot device within various superhero comic books. Also, the site seeks to analyze why these plot devices are used disproportionately on female characters.WiR also sparked discussion outside of comic book fandom. In 2000, several national newspapers ran articles that referenced the site. The articles about WiR generated discussion on the topic of sexism in pop culture and the comic book industry. This website is cited by a number of Universities while discussing gender perception in literature.  Note by self: In this essay I have tried to discuss how this sexist phenomenon in popular literature was also used as a plot device by the writers of yore.Main Text:Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

Well done.peer 2      Clear and coherent with appropriate critical apparatus. Style almost always accurate with a few minor, awkward phrases that do not hinder understandingpeer 3      The form is OK except for several minor errors in spelling and grammar. Some examples: 1) The term should be ""Women in Refrigerators"" as per your footnote. 2) ""their woman"" should be ""their women"" 3) ""Georgia   s birthmark"" should be ""Georgiana   s birthmark""peer 4      Nicely written however confusion over the use of ""his"" and ""her"". Other than that point good examples used as quotations.Content:peer 1      The idea of a very anti women role is a great one and could also be shown in Poe's works as well such as the black cat and the raven with the lost Lenore. Great work.peer 2      I have nevere heard of this concept and so really enjoyed reading your essay - it was insightful, linked to he texts appropriately and I really learned something! Thank youpeer 3      Interesting content that made me think about the role of women in this type of literature.peer 4      The lover in the story of Rappaccini's daughter is Italian not Spanish. However that does not detract from the argument about the comparison of the woman in the refrigerator theory. Yet these stories are from a time when women were still subjegated by men and viewed as possessions and not equals. I do see the similarity between this and the comic strip technique but I think a bit more discussion of the history might have strengthed this piece.  ;Yay! I am so excited to at last ""meet"" one of my peers! No one ever popped in to say hi before when I posted my peer's comments here. Thanks so much for your feedback and insights, James.  Thanks for the link, Greg!  It wasn   t going to be    Cobalt Blue.    It was going to be    Sapphire Blue.    In other words, it was going to be a woman.Indeed, that's always the point. I was quite enthralled by this phenomena in comic books, and I soon realized this is too true of many many authors - and it's just not fair!  Looks like apart from reading and writing good poetry, you enjoy graphic novels too!;Greg, you are correct. However, if you read on what Gail Simone has to say about this a bit further, you will notice she tries to get the graphic novel writers explain  why  this phenomena is important. Also, while the revenge motif is an important part of the troupe, it is not always the only reason for killing off the female characters (something you will discover is you look under ""lists"" in the WiR site noted in my citation).Finally, the very reason Gail talks about WiR is because she realizes this is extremely sexist. This is exactly what I have picked up on. WiR gives a contemporary/pop reference to a phenomena that was being used by male authors for quite sometime - kill off the woman, use her death to evoke emotion in the readers. In Hawthorne's works, as I mention, the hero and the villain merge together - ultimately resulting in the woman's death - hence evoking the required response from the reader.;Thanks, Martha! That's an interesting topic - the Madwoman in the Attic, I mean. There are so many ways of looking at this particular theme. I am sure you have already done your research, but just to reiterate - don't miss  Wide  Sargasso Sea .  ;@Greg: That is a really an out of the box way of looking at 'The Tell Tale Heart.' I mean I just automatically imagined the killer to be a man!  @ Martha: I understand. I am assuming you are in Fiction of Relationship too. So much to read!!  ;Wow! This time people really did go all out creative, didn't they? A verse and a Woolf-Poe induced short-story. I wonder if another Literature course running in parallel to this had anything to do with these choice of topics.  ;Thanks for sharing, Sean. Very well-written and interesting to read. Your command over the language is very impressive. (I have to admit, I want to know the answer to what Peer 1 has to ask.) In spite of providing a few details about Poe's life, you still manage to talk about the poem's theme as well as the use of language and it's essential overall effect on the reader - and doing all that within the word limit is really commendable.  I understand your need to include the bit about Nabokov's letter. When you know something like that, it is hard not to put it in your essay! I really enjoyed reading Lolita  and I wish I knew this bit when I was reading it.    Thanks again.;"

(Where ""original"" means ""not an adaptation,"" not ""in German."") I'm familiar with all of the standard contemporary interpretations in animated movies and picture books, so the (lack of?) moralizing in many of the stories has come as a surprise to me, or the moral lesson feels a little   _ off (e.g., Faithful John, where the ""right"" thing to do was for the king to behead his two children).Has anyone else noticed the same?;Interesting comment about the parallel between the king and Abraham. I hadn't thought of that, mostly because God doesn't end up actually having Isaac sacrificed, whereas the king actually cuts off his children's heads, not knowing that Faithful John can bring them back to life.I'm going to think more about the Christian themes/Biblical parallels bit in this, it's quite interesting and I hadn't considered it before.;Docility and submissiveness were valued traits in ""underlings"" of any sort: children to their parents, peasants to their lords, lords of their kings and, of course, every human being to God.;I didn't say I found them too drastic to read, just that I was surprised by the moral ambiguity and sometimes apparent lack of a moral lesson to the stories. Oftentimes, things just happen and there's no particular moral lesson from them, whereas Perrault's fairy tales (which I've read before) end with an explicitly stated moral of the story. (For an example, here's Perrault's Blue Beard; scroll to the end to see the moral.);If you read the part about sitting on the rabbit's tail as a sexual metaphor (think about the snake's tail in the Aesop's fable analyzed in the video), then the maiden left home to marry the rabbit because she really had no other choice because she had been (ahem) ""deflowered"" by him. Interesting then, that she lives in a garden with her mother, but no father is mentioned.;I've never heard of the cabbage as a symbol of female fertility. Am I missing something here?

I originally write 600-800 words and then have to weed out paragraphs until I can get it around 300. ;I really like this idea, it is helpful to see so many other people's essay. I realize now that I picked what I assumed to be an original and insightful topic, but clearly many other people wrote about the same thing. However, since this is my first reading of the two books, I am generally pleased with my essay. I   am not sure what peer 4 means by ""your first sentence begs for a citation"". I wrote it, why would I need to cite it?      Dreams are a way of interpreting and processing the things we fear most in life. In ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", Alice fears growing up and leaving childhood behind. Through her dream time in Wonderland, Alice is able to both physically and emotionally grow, and in the process come to terms with her new role as a young woman.                In Wonderland, Alice continually grows and shrinks, and it is this continual shift in size that reflects the internal debate over staying a child and growing up. At first Alice resists the constant changes in size, like when she states ""'I-I'm a little girl.' ... as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day"" (Carroll 51). She tries to convince herself that she is still that same littel girl she used to be.  But as the story continues, see becomes comfortable with and almost unobservant to her shifts in size.                   As Alice moves through Wonderland and becomes more confident in herself, she begins to accept her new role. The scene where Alice nurses the baby shows how Alice is now physically prepared for womanhood. However, she does not really want the responsibility, showing how she may not be emotionally mature yet.                      It is only when Alice accepts her new size and is comfortable with a role of maturity, that she wakes from her dream. Once Alice is back in the real world, there is not just a shift Alice's perception of herself, but also her sister's perception of her. As Alice walks away her sister reflects on how much Alice has grown, ""first she dreamed of little Alice, once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee"" (122). Here it is clear that Alice is not that little girl anymore.                     Alice's journey through Wonderland is not just a frivoulous dream as some might interpret, but rather it is Alice's own way of accepting her fate as a woman and coming to terms with the loss of her childhood. She enters Wonderland a frightened uncertain little girl and emerges a confident woman.  peer 1      The text is well written and clear, but I think you should try to use less paragraphs.peer 2      Your essay has beautiful structure and grammar and it flowed wonderfully. My only complaint is minor and a matter of opinion. Your sentence, ""...showing how she may not be emotionally mature yet."" might sound more professional if structures thus, ""showing how she may not yet be emotionally mature."" Moving ""yet"" to the end of the sentence isn't incorrect -- it just makes the sentence kind of ugly.peer 3      This is a very well written short essay. I think the only improvement that really needs to be made is proof reading. Take this sentence as an example: ""But as the story continues, see becomes comfortable with and almost unobservant to her shifts in size."" You probably shouldn't start sentences with conjunctions and there are several typos that could have been easily caught with a quick proof read. Just some thoughts for the next time.peer 4      Your first sentence begs a citation--but you follow with a sound thesis. You have a few errors in punctuation and grammar, and I feel that these could be eradicated with another read through of your work before submission. I like that you give page numbers from the book to refer to for you reader.Score from peers 2peer 1      I really enjoyed the idea of interpreting alice as a passage from childhood to adulthood and I'd like to hear more about it.peer 2      My essay was on the same topic, though you used different examples and evidence. I enjoyed reading your essay because it pointed out things I had missed during my read-through to include in my own assignment. I struggle to find some way to improve your ideas; so maybe if you'd included more quotes from the books to support your evidence?peer 3      I think this is a really interesting topic. You do a great job setting up your thesis statement and using examples from the text to back up your points. I'm not sure I completely agree with your assessment that Alice goes in a child and comes out as an adult. I think maybe she comes out a little wiser, and perhaps a little less innocent, but still very much a child. Also, make sure to proof read! You're a little over words on the essay. I think you were over 350 words. Using more concise language will help as well. Try no to use so many ""to be"" verbs. There are way too many ""is's"". Thanks for giving me something interesting to think about.

If so I like it, but only 1/3 of the paper is about that. I think that is why you received a 3.  While I think peer 5 was a little harsh, he did have a point that the essay doesn't really say much about the books. Overall. I think that focusing specifically on content for the book will help.  ;Usually I write down ideas or a rough draft on a lot of ideas. Then I choose the one that was the easiest for me to write about, or that I wrote the best about. I almost always end up choosing something different than I originally planned. ;I think this is a really interesting point. i taught an entire class last semester on the hero's journey and we came up with the same conclusion as John Steinbeck when he stated, ""We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil"".  While Harry Potter may pull a lot from Dracula, I think it is a stretch to say it got its inspirtation form it. Thats what makes Harry Potter so great, it pulls from so many sources. Even the characters' names are allusions to other books or myths (even down to Filch's cat - named after Mrs. Norris in Mansfield Park). Teamwork is seen in dozens of fantasy novels (think lord of the rings), and almost every book ever written has a hero with sidekicks. Almost every book ever written also has a wise mentor, (Merlin, Gandalf, a fairy godmother, etc).  I think a fairer assessment might be that both Dracula and Harry Potter pull from similar ideas, beliefs, values, knowledge, etc. They are both relfections about what it means to be human, and good, how to overcome not only the evils of society, but within ourselves. ;As to the ""state my opinion"" part, I have read several essay where the write says ""it is my opinion that"" or something similar. Typically this is frowned upon in writing because it is redundant, but I would suggest not doing that in this class because it wastes space. In an essay so short, using 5 words to tell us something we already know is a waste of space. That space could be used to elaborate on your thesis. ;Laurie, I liked your essay. Your thesis brought up a really interesting idea. Just a suggestion, write shorter sentences. Sentence 1 is four lines long and the 2nd sentence of paragraph 3 is 5 lines long. (But, that is just a suggestion coming from someone who is also prone to lengthy sentences). Otherwise, I really liked your essay.  ;Here is my essay. Also feel free to give feedback, as most of my reviewers didn't bother to write anything.    In Dracula, Stoker demonstrates the timeless battle between the new modern methods of science and old ways of superstition. Through the character of Van Helsing, we see Stoker's claim that science alone is not enough, but that both science and superstition are needed for success.    Throughout the novel, Van Helsing uses science to prolong life and aid the characters in finding Dracula, but this science is not enough. Despite numerous attempts to heal Lucy with scientific blood transfusions, Van Helsing is not able to save her. He also uses the new science of hypnosis to discover Dracula's location, but eventually this too is not enough to lead them directly to Dracula. While science is an aid on their mission to protect themselves and kill Dracula, it alone cannot do the job.    Because Van Hesling represents the bridge between science and superstition, he knows that they need something more powerful than just science. As he explains to Seward, ""it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain"" (227). He tells Seward that while science claims to have all the answers, it in fact was not enough to save Lucy and will not be enough to defeat Dracula.   In the end, it is not science that defeats Dracua, rather it is the religious iconography and superstitious practices that bring him down. Van Helsing uses his knowledge of the old ways to protect them against Dracula, and they use communion wafers, crucifixes, and garlic to ward against his attacks. In the end, when Dracula is killed, Mina even describes it with religious terminology. Upon seeing Dracula crumple to dust on the floor, she  states, ""it was like a miracle, but before our very eyes"" (442). Even Dracula's death is not that of a scientific one, but a magical or religious one.    While many characters represent either the side of science or superstition, Van Helsing is the true mixture of the two. It is through this character that Stoker shows why both are necessary.  ;Laurie, just critique it like you would if it was one of your essays to review please. Pretty much the only comment I received was ""I can't give you a 3 because I didn't learn anything new from your paper, because I wrote about the same topic"". As you can imagine, that wasn't very helpful.   ;All great feedback guys, thanks so much! As you can tell the word limit has been tough for me. I always start off with around 500 words and then hav to narrow it down. I think I originally had something about van Helsing in the intro as my original thesis was about her stoker uses him to bridge the gap between science and superstition, but I cut it out.  It's been a while since I've written a paper, so it's been tough getting back into the swing of things. I appreciate your comments, they were all very helpful! :) ;I agree with Celine's comment. I always find it helpful to start with a broad idea and narrow down. This makes it clearer what your thesis is and helps you elaborate on it. I definitely agree that you should never say ""my thesis is"", but I think your thesis was obvious. You refer back to it frequently in your essay which shows consistency and that you are trying to prove your thesis. I don't think your essay suffered from lack of thesis, just too general of one.  ;Hey theo, before I even start reading your essay, I just had to say that first paragraph was awesome.

In my opinion, your thesis would be sharpened further. Perhaps you would have focus on just one example, and link it more to your thesis?;Hi all,  Below is my essay. Is my essay really as bad as what my peer 1 says? Feel free to criticize it...By choosing to divide the chapters of  Dracula  into various chapters based on the journals or diary entries of the various characters in the novel, Bram Stoker has successfully made the readers immersed themselves into the innermost thoughts and emotions of those characters.Why is this so?By their nature, journals and diary entries are private and are often meant to be read by either the writer themselves, or their closed ones. Therefore, the authors of such entries are often free to write about their innermost thoughts and feelings, as they knew that they would be relatively safe from the prying eyes of nosy strangers.Take for example, in the first chapter, Jonathan Harker wrote in his journal entries about the various meals he had during his journal to Transylvania. Almost as an aside, Jonathan noted that he had asked for the recipe of those dishes for Mina. Such details would normally not be omitted from novels written in the conventional manner, as they are superfluous and not necessary for the progression of the plot. However, Bram, by adding such intimate details into the novel, it makes the readers feel like they are actually peeking into the mind of Jonathan. This has the effect of closing the distance between the reader and Jonathan, and making the readers feel that they understood more about what goes on in Jonathan   s psyche.Furthermore, by their nature, diary entries and journals lack the omniscient narrator, and are based upon the memory of the author themselves. Therefore, their accuracy is not expected to be perfect, just like how human nature is. Precisely due to their imperfect nature and reminiscence to reality, Bram, has succeeded in making the readers feel that the story had really occurred in real life. This would, in turn, make them feel more for the trials and ordeals of the protagonists.Form:peer 1      First of all, it is very obvious that you are not a natural English speaker. Your words are definitely not used properly, there are many mistakes in this regard, for example ""during his journal to Transylvania"" /I believe you meant ""journey""/. English grammar is also very neglected, there is also inproper use of tenses. All in all, it was very hard to follow your thought and you could have probably performed better if you simply used ""Google Translate"". I apologize for the rude comment but you really have to work on your English.peer 4      Very well put up essay. Was a pleasure to read. No grammatical errors i could make out.Content:peer 1      Although I do agree with the thesis that the epistolary structure of the novel contributes to the feeling that the events described in the book actually occurred in reality, your essay wasn't exactly convincing and persuasive. Perhaps the lack of fluency in the language hinders your ability to lay out your arguments clearly. You definitely should put more effort into the task next time.peer 4      A very good essay i had never really noticed this. You have clearly read the book very well and i really enjoyed reading your essay it had a lot of insight and was pretty original. I liked your analysis.Other Comments:peer 1      It is really annoying that you are referring to Bram Stoker simply as ""Bram"". What is he, a friend of yours or something?peer 2      Good point about the author's perspectivepeer 4      Loved the essay thank you so much for an enriching read  ;Hi all, Thanks for the feedback.

It's not all about getting just your point of view I guess, but analizing the author's mind at the moment he/her wrote the book can be helpful ;Hm, I can see what you all mean. Nina has worded my concern very eloquently: any supplemental texts are written from the viewpoint of a person, and in some way reflects their thoughts and ideas on the topic, thus ""programming"" the reader's perception. While fretting over dry facts being presented by their proponents vs. opponents is probably going too far in this case, can ideas prompted by another person's understanding of the text be considered our own? Referencing is what I would do too, but there was no word of such option in introductory videos. I guess it boils down to whether the essay is supposed to be strictly the reader's comprehension of the perceived reading material, or a summary of a research the reader is capable and willing to do, analyse through his/her perspective and spit out on the paper? I'm leaning towards first reading the book, writing the draft of the essay, and only then checking out what else is out there...

The Grimm brothers very often mix medieval and pre-modern (as in the transition of medieval to modern times) with modern behaviors, places and objects. They were not the only ones, but the moralizing themes in their tales (or better: their takes on popular tales) may somewhat justify that, since they were trying to reach their contemporaries and at the same time maintain a sort of moral tradition. ;Megan - spoke to a good friend who writes wonderful modern history historical novels. Of course I mentioned fantasy as a crime novel. His latest one is set in Italy in the Red Bragade era. We got in a lively discussion but he certainly didn't agree. ;If I heard the video correctly, the instructor said something along the lines of ""if you turn in all your assignments on time and they meet the criteria, you will get an ""A.""   This leads me to believe that the peer reviews are a vehicle to critically analyze the essays of our classmates and gain alternate perspectives of the reading assignments, thus enriching our own experiences and thought processes.   Likewise, the peer reviews allow us to share our own perspectives and thoughts with other students regarding their own essays.   I think the intention is to learn how to provide and process constructive criticism to the benefit of all parties.   To that end, if you (in general) consistently receive 1's on your essays, then you aren't reading the comments and taking them to heart to improve your writing.   Again, paraphrasing the video, when you complete the course, if you have done all the assignments, your writing and thinking will have improved through the process of peer review.;I agree with everyone of Studio Ghibli, especially those by Hayao Miyazaki.Along the lines of anime I would also reccomend a series i just finished, Towa no quon.

Thirty years later there was an Outer Limits marathon on, and I think I must have been an avid watcher, because one of the episodes was VERY similar to my dream.   I've always wondered about collective memory, though.   I remember as a child, the first time I saw pictures of the pyramids and Stonehenge, I had this ""oh yeahhh"" feeling, like I was supposed to know what they were for......and just couldn't recall.....;This is an interesting take on the tales - and I think points to how the tales each appeal to people in an individualized manner. For myself I am finding that while I'm enjoying my old favourites at a certain level, I am far more enthralled with ones that I have never read before.   The Six Soldiers of Fortune is my new favourite, followed closely by the Robber Bridegroom (probably due to it's gothic flavor).   I'm fairly sure it's not simply novelty which is influencing me this way - I'm certainly not enjoying all new ones, certainly not all to the same extent - though it may be part of it. Thus, while the familiarity of specific tales may be the overriding factor for some, for myself it is the weaving of the fantastical elements and the possibility of enlarging my imagination. I am also finding the ethnic part of this discussion interesting. As one  of Ukrainian and Danish heritage, I know that I find Ukrainian and Danish folklore more appealing than the Grimm tales. I'm not sure that it is because they are more familiar - because I grew up with Danish and Grimm tales, and my grandmother orally passed down Ukrainian ones.;wow, excellent point Anna. I wonder how much that has been studied. Sociology or literature or both for more info, do you think?;I'm using the copy from the Gutenberg project (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068): epub for my e-reader, and html for the PC. Very convenient, since this is the same copy, so it 100% syncs;When I read the one about the Rabbit, I definitely thought sex and domestic abuse. There are a few others where authors I think imply sex (or sexual harassment), but certainly couldn't be blunt about it at the time, even if they'd have been writing an adult story. E.g. in The Goose Girl ""she sat down and began to comb out her hair; then Conrad came up and wanted to seize upon some of it"". Yeah, right, like he'd care about her hair sooo much.I believe other animals in the story represent a bunch of Rabbit's buddies. None of the ""people"" present is human - meaning none of the Bride's friends and relatives are there. So she feels lonely and threatened, because she knows no one, and if anything happens, no one will stand up for her.I couldn't find any other meaning behind Six Soldiers of Fortune except the superhero idea and vengeance/ restoring justice. No socialistic feel either: with the power the group have, they can easily throw over the king, yet they don't even consider any other way to go about seizing power except marrying the princess, because the birth right of the monarchy is still sacred.;In Roland, drops of blood talk in stead of the dead person they come from - seem in line with the believe that in blood resides the soul, thus giving it magical properties, though I might be wrong...;Now that I'm rereading the  Six Soldiers of Fortune, it appears to be a warning tale too, only this time to the ruler: honestly pay to your  faithful  servants, or you may lose much more than their salary.;I bet she is. Take The Elves: they do your work perfectly for you, and you release them by giving them closes. This does ring a bell, doesn't it? ;)  ;That's a very good question!Hm, I suppose going too far back in time and/or space despite being very interesting might have required a lot of background knowledge not everyone would have and/or lots of additional research to grasp the workings of the human mind behind the stories.  So we limit ourselves to the European/American tradition of the latest 200 years - the one most familiar to the English speaking audience; and writing of manageable size. Mind, I'm just thinking out loud here, and can be on the totally wrong track.The first half of the reading list consists of the novels and stories that are so much of a cultural heritage, finding someone who doesn't know what they are about even without reading the originals is rather difficult (and I fervently hope this is not going to be changed by glittery vampires any time soon). The second half I haven't cracked yet. Different subgenres? Dunno. Looking forward to hearing more ideas on the topic;Thank you for creating this thread, I'm looking forward to seeing what people recommend!For the sake of informative value, I'll avoid the books from the course list and those on the summit of popularity now, who would have made the list  otherwise  (Tolkien,  George R. R. Martin). So:1.  Flowers for Algernon by  Daniel Keyes2.  The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov3. Henry Kuttner's Hogben stories4. Night Watch by Sergei Lukyananko (the whole pentalogy really)5. Isaac Asimov's short stories (Nightfall, The Martian Way etc);I hear you. It's similar to traveling with a digital camera: instead of taking the sights in and savoring the experience, I'd constantly look for good shots. Thank you, but no, thank you. I take photos exclusively when I spot something irresistible. I take notes when I come across a phrase or notion that stirs something within and makes my hand subconsciously reach for a pen and notebook. Or, like you said, my own ideas inspired by the piece. Such approach might be troublesome on occasion, when the need to analyse arises, and yet, I find it more beneficial if I want to see the forest instead of the trees  ;Erm, don't you think you're being too hard on the cock? It's the hen who triggers the whole domino effect by going back on their deal, and the cock is merely being a good husband by trying to save her. Honestly, I fail to see how he is ignorant, and the arguments here are not shedding any light for me either. Maybe only not recognizing the intents of other beasts could count as such, but then again, what is he to say? No, you can't come with me, eat us up right here, if you will. If this thesis is to work, I believe it needs to have stronger support of the arguments throughout the analysis.;Valid arguments, thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.I'm currently half-way through the novel, and I feel Stoker maintains a good balance between writing his female lead as a smart and industrious woman with an active stance in life, and remaining within the constrains of his contemporary culture. Mina mentions that she ""never knew either father or mother"", which explains her ability and readiness to stand for herself and her loved ones; and that ""you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit"", which accounts for her willingness to step into the approved female role she was taught to pursue from young age. Granted, after the female bashing that was Grimm stories, I might be overly more forgivable than usual :);While reading the first story, I had a strong feeling of the whole Wonderland being the world of adults - ridiculous as it appears through eyes of a child - and ""high"" society at that. I've yet to read any additional sources, so if I'm talking nonsense, please, let me down gently :)Coming from the adult world theory, who is the Queen of Hearts? Not any allusions to the real Queen I imagine - that would be too unimaginative. So, my theory is fate. If one wants to be in the high society, he/she has to play this game of chance (croquet here), where it's possible to be in favour one moment, and on the verge of loosing everything at another. Moreover, ""tools"" (employees? servants?) independently factor in - they can take sides, or throw a spanner in the works by merely being stubborn. Thoughts?;"
False,St88,Coh1,0.42857142857142855,0,1,1.0,0.0316174,0.965491579,0.7,0.0,0.35,0.423728825,0.0,"Wow, that's some serious bit of research! Your conclusion seems well-justified, I believe it'll make a strong essay. As a counterargument I can only ask: don't you suppose it was rather dangerous to mock the powers that be so to say in such a direct manner? This can be a risky endeavor even at present with all our laws to protect the freedom of speech and other human rights...Thanks for your thoughts, guys!;Great lecture! I tried my best to keep my mind open while reading, but the insight presented in the videos still blew my mind. Especially loved the scientific bits in the one about structure and meanings - universal concepts of the human culture have always fascinated me. Thank you!;That's what makes HP such a prolific ground for fanfiction ;);I believe those percentages are more like guidelines to stop people from downgrading every other essay for small details or marking everyone with 3s for encouragement. 2 is the default mark. I gave only one 1, when I couldn't make out what half of the essay was about, and one 3, when I couldn't think of any advise for improvement.I wonder how the average we see when our assignments come back is counted - the step seems to be a half (3, 3.5, 4 etc), at least I haven't seen anyone share any 4.2s or similar. Does this mean singular 1s and 3s get lost in rounding off?  ;Hm, I'm confused. I do of course realize fractional grades can only happen when all the scores from different peers are averaged, and only if they are different in the first place. But you speak of an individual score. I can see only totals for form, content and overall for my essay - is there any way to get access to grades given by each separate peer?;Ah, that was a nice thought :) Oh, well;Added to my reading list, thanks for the recommendation!As far as the topic of the thread goes, I remember complaining about  Ulysses in similar way back in college I think. Then a friend of mine suggested I either find someone to explain it to me or read up on the critical material, and only then can I complain about this brilliant piece in her presence. This was a lesson I won't forget: one is  absolutely entitled to a personal opinion of a book, but not before giving it an honest and wholehearted effort.;Hm, you run the risk of shifting the highlight to that modern piece, only using the one we study instead of actually studying it. This is rather risky - if the essay is well-researched and written, I wouldn't downgrade it, but I can see other students rejecting the approach.;Glad to be of service. You know, as long as you put in honest work and have fun, there's no way you can fail ;) Good luck!;I don't know about beautiful, but Once Upon a Time TV series is heavily based on Grimms' fairy tales, Alice, Pinocchio etc, whose characters are stuck in a modern town reliving their fairy-tale roles without knowing it or being able to change anything, unless...;I think it makes a lot of sense, Paul. As a child, I read Alice in Russian translation (BTW, can't wait to compare it to the original now, and see how well it is translated), and found it quite brilliant. Wished my dreams were so lucid and fun! Maybe the rejection has something to do with never being exposed to this book back when the mind was still flexible? Or mere incompatibility of the author's personality type to one of the reader? :) Dunno.I'm a bit surprised to see that readers expect little children to not miss their home, lack of responsibility for their own sustenance, safety, parents...;Oh, I know - my dream as a child was to end up on a desert island all alone :) A few times I admitted to this, people - my peers mostly - stared at me like I was out of my mind. So I believe for overwhelming majority even the idea itself is hard to swallow. If you factor in the danger main characters encounter during such adventures, even I can relate to their goal... Maybe if they were from abusive surroundings, it would be a different story...Speaking of a goal, you got me wondering - there should be one in a plot, so that the character's actions had some...direction, purpose if you will. Let's imagine neither Alice nor Dorothy strive to return home. Theoretically, what could be their major goal?;*pouts* But I like plots... And I'm a very goal-oriented person... Oh, well :);Well, though I've liked the Alice dilogy well enough for its mere artistic merit, comments on the social background definitely add some layer of appreciation. Only I'm not sure whether this is 'English' or historical part of it. ;Not much to contribute, except I recall hearing about the theory that we all live in the God's dream/mind. Should he forget about a person, (s)he will cease to exist. Unfortunately, I don't remember where I heard this, it was a long time ago...;That's an interesting question! Hm, I'm not intimately familiar with literature of the period, but if I remember correctly, first person and omniscient point of view were generally used. The former limits the piece to experiences of only one person, so can be unsuitable if there's a lot going on, or if main character is unconscious/asleep/otherwise indisposed at some crucial points. The latter requires considerable efforts to create suspense.Off the top of my head, letters and diaries allow the author to:limit the number of PoV characters without keeping only one,dive deeper into the character's personality (diaries) and their relationships with others (letters),show the same events through the prism of different perceptions,naturally hide some stuff, or inform the reader bit by bit,  create some additional suspense by simply having a character abstain from writing,avoid writing many dialogues while still retaining the communication part of the story,  create false impression of recovered record that shows true events.Just my musings, would love to see what other students think;Maybe this will become an issue further into the course... Based on my experience with the 1st assignment, the percentage seems perfectly valid. There're plenty of people here who haven't had much experience with writing essays/non-scientific essays/in English.When push comes to shove, I highly doubt you'll be penalized for giving out as many 3s as you want, if you truly believe the work to be beyond improving. After all, since assignment of peers is randomized, someone else can get  essays  that are all  average instead.As far as the criteria are concerned, I'd add continuity (sentences flow from one into the next in a manner that is easy to read), wide use of advanced vocabulary and proper style (no contractions, varied sentence structures etc);I agree with your point - a 270-320 word essay that requires a dictionary to decipher would clearly be an exaggeration :) And of course, this is only one of the criteria that should ideally accompany each other.What I meant by advanced vocabulary is the use of words that are a step-up from basic learner's vocab... Hm, that doesn't come out right. An example: she was angry with him for what he did vs. his actions infuriated her. Both are (hopefully:)) grammatically correct, and neither sends an advanced student to fetch a dictionary, yet I find the second one to be more advanced and pleasing to read in academic setting.Anyway, the initial question was about what would take a student closer to submitting an ideal essay, not merely a passable one. The points Peter lists easily make up an essay worthy of 2, as far as I'm concerned. If I see one which uses simple words, but weaves them on Hemingway's level, I'd have no problem ranking it higher!;I recognize the point you guys are making, as I have commented on the lack of paragraphs twice during the first review session. However, Joshua, don't you suppose it's a bit too harsh to fail a student, who spent days reading the assigned material and thinking on the thesis, then hours writing and editing the essay itself, only because their formatting causes you seconds worth of displeasure? This, of course, assuming the work you're referring to has no other issues, as it appears from the post.Whereas Paul is right, we will lose the majority of students by the end of the course, I believe it to be very important that they leave only because they feel they can't manage the workload under their circumstances, not because overly strict treatment of peers discourages them from participating.;Have you heard of a criticism sandwich? Praise on top and bottom, constructive criticism in the middle. And there's always something to praise if one will just look. I simply believe it unfair to penalize student for a small mistake, but overlook plenty of positive points.As far as soft skin goes, forgive me my abruptness, but this sounds rather like abuse. 9 out of 10 students will take constructive criticism, I'm sure, in the spirit it's offered, as long as you make the effort to explain what is seriously wrong with their essay. The only one I gave 1 to lacked both the thesis and conclusion, and half of it was written in unintelligible English - puts things into perspective, doesn't it? Yet, my version of ""better safe than sorry"" is trusting that the person put as much effort in it as I did in mine, and deserves fair consideration instead of a brush off. Why should anyone else do the job I wouldn't?;Oh, no, dear, I didn't think it was directed at me, or I wouldn't reply so harshly :) You can say I was being a mother hen to our fellow students. Ok, to myself too: I take criticism rather well, outright bashing - not so much.  The freedom to express our honest opinions of the piece certainly has it's pros and cons. At least, having our own essays reviewed by someone this very moment should hopefully remind that we should be ready to take what we dish out!;Well, apparently, Carroll was the first author to write a book for children that didn't have any moral for them to learn. I've noticed many instances of him mocking moral lessons and the education system in general. Comments in the recommended edition note that too.P.S. Erm, moral isn't the main point of the Grimm tales - Professor speaks of this in the Unit 1 lectures.;Definitely 3rd person. As a child, I for some reason perceived 1st person as 2nd instead: like I'm being told what I do, where I go etc. This used to irritate me to no end. And though I've overcome this dislike by now, and can enjoy 1st person well enough, some preference for 3rd person remains;I quite enjoyed the novel. The instances you guys have mentioned also earned an eyeroll from me, as well as the men leaving Mina in ""safety"" of the asylum to go hunt the Count. Guess Stoker didn't see enough horror-movies to realize how obvious an opening that is, he-he. But overall, this was an enjoyable read. After so many movies about vampires to finally get so close to the inception and connect the dots of where the whole idea comes from is really exciting.P.S. It turns out Van Helsing is a Dracula character - don't laugh, but that was a surprise to me!;I think your thesis makes sense if we go into the definition of ""mad"". What is insanity anyhow? Isn't this mostly a social notion which means ""deemed weird, impossible to understand, and maybe dangerous by the majority""? The majority of the real world are rather similar to Alice, so she's considered perfectly sane here. However, in the Wonderland she sticks out from what is the norm there, which makes her appear insane in it's inhabitants' eyes.This is not the way I see the book, which makes your perspective even more insightful to me. Thanks for sharing and good luck with your grade!;It would be interesting to see a breakdown of essay subjectsThat's a very interesting idea, I'd love to see that too!;Interesting essay - I especially loved the quote from  Andras Feldmar, and ensuing conclusion. The parallel between strict rules of games in Wonderland and the real life, which don't quite work in neither is quite insightful too.Critique wise - I believe the consensus is to include a thesis in the first paragraph. Without it I have troubles understanding what the main point is. The 2nd paragraph first states that children book characters should be good or evil, then goes on to say this is not so in Alice. Do you mean children cannot understand the book or relate to the character?What I've spotted grammar wise:  For a child it is equally difficult to... as...;  preventing adults from...Hope that's helpful. Thanks for sharing!;Wow, that's pretty crazy!There's a tiny ""flag"" link at the right bottom of the essay - maybe this is one of the cases it's to be used for?;Well, if you speak of the essay assignments, we're supposed to support our take on the reading material with evidence. Sometimes the author him/herself doesn't realize the full meaning of what (s)he has written (Freudian slip anyone?), so there's nothing inherently right or wrong in the way each student perceives the text. You can always drop by the forum, and see what others think of your idea, and whether some good counterargument can be offered.Welcome, and good luck catching up!;"

I love the beginning and the ending, but the middle looks to me like it's been mercilessly compressed for want of space... Not trying to spoil the party, sorry if it looks this way;Absolutely brilliant! It's not only informative, but also engaging, and well-written - definitely a 6!;You mean unique ""voice"" of characters? Hm, I definitely had no problem telling the PoV characters apart, though it may be largely due to different topics and attitude to them expressed in their passages. I also have very clear visuals of Lucy and Mina, but not of the men, so you may be on to something.Well, in Frankenstein about 95% (no hard data, just approximation) is in Victor's PoV, and since he's a rather self-absorbed character to put it mildly, the reliability of the details of others' words and behaviour is uncertain.  ;As a non-native speaker, I can relate. However, we're all here to learn and do our best. Writing assignments have already proved very beneficial to my writing skill, and I look forward to improving further. Granted, it would be fun to trick all peers into believing me a native speaker to the point of awarding my essay all 3s for form, but even if this never happens, there're not so many places I can get unbiased comments on my writing free of charge ;);Unless it was particularly gruesome. Remember, Dracula used to go out in the guise of Jonathan? And it seems the woman who chased Dracula after he abducted her baby took Jonathan for the perpetrator. Who knows how dwellers of the nearby village met him, and what he had to do to get away...I'm curious as much as you are :) but the fact is I kind of like that this part is omitted, since it has no bearing on the plot whatsoever.;Even if she was an ideal recipient, transfusion from four different donors would have likely killed her. Nowadays, only a small measure of O+ is allowed be given to a person with another blood type in a critical cases - it's really hard of the liver from what I've heard. And even the same type of blood can easily be incompatible due to less known nuances.Unfortunately, Stoker couldn't have known that - blood types were only discovered in 1900, so he probably followed the usual misconception of the time - if they love her, their blood won't kill her :) Or maybe Dracula has a poison on his fangs that transmutes victim's blood into AB+? Or the transfusions really did kill her - some of the symptoms can be interpreted that way...;English wasn't a lingua franca yet, French was. So his wide English vocabulary and understandable though accented speech is pretty impressive I believe;I second Sean: if it was a science course, making us struggle through the material and then deliver it would be frustrating and unnecessary. However, this is a literature course - the Professor's opinion, though much more experienced, is just that, an opinion. Much of it is based on his age, personal experiences... Like with Alice - the theme of death seems more relevant to him, which definitely enlightened me, but I've found themes more relevant to me, exactly because I didn't hear that before starting.Essentially, I believe this course is aimed at teaching us to read critically and think for ourselves, when we have graduated and endeavor to read some next book, instead of feeding us some preconceived notions about some specific reading material.;Lucy invited him some time before that - only the first invitation is needed.;Megan explains things brilliantly as always, I second every word.I can relate to feeling you have more interesting ideas you'd like to share. Remember, you can always post them on the forum. While you won't get grades, you may get to discuss your thoughts in more detail than in the essay, and get different opinions that will widen your perception of the book whether you agree with them or not.;I second that - seeing that we were actually encouraged to start reading longer pieces even before the course started, it seems counterproductive to withhold introductory videos about them. I always prefer to read in advance, and mostly finish by Thursday so that I had time to think on the essay, discuss some details on the forum etc. In fact, discovering that I'd been reading the edition of Alice different from the recommended one, and still had about 100 pages of comments to go through threw me so much, I almost ended up skipping the essay. So if the videos are prerecorded anyway, early release would be appreciated!;I'm one third through Frankenstein, and for the first time in ages fail to find any redeemable qualities in the main character... Not only does he have foresight and responsibility of a three-year old (""The mess I've created ran away - hurrah! I'll just leave others to deal with it and go on my marry way.""), he also leaps to conclusions at miles per second, has zero attention to evidence (achievements in science? rrrrright), gets completely blinded by prejudice, and complains that he's the most miserable man ever only a few times per chapter. What's not to like? Please, tell me it gets better! Because right now I'm inclined to attribute long-standing attitude towards scifi-fantasy as not serious writing to Mrs. Shelley's single-handed efforts...;I'll keep that in mind, thanks. I kind of keep hoping I'm not getting something - this is a case when being proven wrong would be rather nice :);Thanks, I'll be looking forward to that!;An excellent advice for dealing with real-life ""characters"" of that type. ""if you can't avoid them"" I would add. The problem I have with Victor is that in addition to all those features, unlike real people I can't get where he's coming from. His biography and behaviour scream impostor, so much they don't fit. That, and the fact that I can't hit him over the head for being an idiot - now that would help!;So many interesting thoughts, thank you, guys!John, I'm half-way through at the moment, and definitely sympathize with the monster more. Call it mother instinct. Because unlike Victor monster mentally is a child - he is what three? four? when they meet again. He behaves according to his age, only since his physical power exceeds one of a child, he can wreck more havoc is all... Hm, I might have an idea for a thesis, thanks!P.S. I wonder if Professor will remind us about Hansel and Grethel - Victor takes on the life-giving job of a female, and that's why it doesn't work out for him;It was my knee-jerk reaction while reading too. But then I remembered the lecture about the unlucky sods who tried to challenge gender roles in fairy tales and paid dearly, and it made me wonder... :);Do I need to relate to characters to enjoy the story? Hell, yeah! Especially the main one. The character doesn't have to be awfully smart (Forrest Gump), or virtuous (Hannibal Lecter), but I must understand where he's coming from, sympathize with his plights or be spooked by his endeavours. I don't believe it good for a book if its endless angst makes me crave crappy fanfics, because it's less pronounced there!On the other hand, I don't think I have ever had so many possible theses written out by the end of reading - apparently, the desire to rationalize facilitates good critical reading!;I considered joining this one too, but decided that two courses that require tons of reading at once would be too much. I take my hat  off  to you guys.My heartfelt sympathies, Javier, - romance as a main plot line can be very exhausting to someone who doesn't particularly enjoy the angsty side of it (and I'm right there with you). Why does ""relationship"" automatically equal ""romance"" anyway? Hope it gets better, or I'll have to revisit my intention to join the next time they run the course...;It has been mentioned  here  that Lucy had negligently low chance of surviving so many transfusions. But technical issues aside, blood appears to be granted more metaphysical importance than it is usual now.First, there're those transfusions. Lucy and Arthur know only about the first one, and both claim they feel already married afterwards. The experiments on blood transfusion between humans I found mentioned for the time period were all conducted between spouses...Then there's the vampires' blood drinking habit, which appears symbolic of sexual intercourse.It seems that blood exchange here is compared to the exchange of other fluids with all the psychological and social consequences. Thoughts?  ;Very interesting question raised, Himanshu. Here are my two cents.Allow me to use your snake example, and ask - where do you know its symbolic meaning from? You might not remember, but you weren't born with this knowledge surely. At some point, someone taught you that, or you drew the conclusion by reading a few books that used the image. What seems intuitive now is actually a result of literature analysis and critical reading that occurred some time in the past.What I'm saying is it might feel laborious right now, because we need to actively think about symbolism in the books, read on the background etc., but thanks to it some time in the future you'll be subconsciously noticing those little details, and they'll add a layer of understanding and fun into your reading; you'll be slipping the images into your writing without actively thinking about it and believe it intuitive. Because intuition comes from our background knowledge, that this course is shaping about now.I was slightly anxious when I first started reading critically - it did seem like I was taking away the magic from the reading. However, very soon I felt I started appreciating good writing not less but more!As it has been said, there's no universal truth, but give it an honest chance. Willingness to experiment is a good trait for an author :);"

By then Mary already lost her prematurely born child, reportedly hallucinated about her, then had another child... Oh, and while she was pregnant for the first time, Percy's wife gave birth to another child of his, so he was spending time with her or... with Mary's step-sister. Abandonment issues all the way;Marc, they influence my understanding of the reading. Though I still don't care much for the endless angst, understanding what influenced Mary's writing - consciously and subconsciously - helps me come in terms with it, and finally get some intellectual pleasure from this read.;""My affection for my guest increases every day"",  ""divine wanderer"", ""His fine and lovely eyes""... Hm, should I jump that ship? ;)Made up or not, no one said there can't be a grain of truth in thereEdit: On second glance, it appears Victor is what Walton has always wanted to be - an educated man. So he admires Victor so much, he trusts that nothing he comes up with can possibly be wrong - Walton must be simply to uncouth to understand it  ;Beautiful text analysis. Jeremy, if this were an essay, I'd give it full points!;A study of pride and ambition? Definitely. There's clearly scientist's responsibility in this one too. Also, it's not tackled directly in the novel, but somewhat reads if we consider the monster literally and in view of recent genetic advances, - does the monster have a soul? Victor seems to treat him as if he's merely a guinea pig, or a zombie for whose life he has full unrestricted rights, but is it so? Moral reasons are the only thing that momentarily stops human cloning, but this will probably not last forever.;Interesting point, I can see what you mean. So you think he's got mental illness and isn't just spoiled rotten? Hm, that's an option.Allow me to join in on the 21st century view! Dibs on cloning. So, some scientist creates a mutant in his home lab, freaks out and lets the creature escape. Let's skip legal trivialities of whether human cloning is allowed in the country in question for a moment. Will anyone care whether the scientist and the monster are mentally challenged? It probably won't have any bearing on the case. If I happened to watch a movie with such plot - yeah, I would expect Victor to tough it out, or at least seek help. Or die out like a mammoth asap.Duh, I think like a modern reader - if the creator is a whiny brat, the author should find another character who'll deal with the situation :);I second that.Actually, Victor has another younger brother left, whose fate we never get to hear about. Of course, it's not like Victor cares how the poor boy feels after loosing his whole family, and not having the privilege of knowing why.;Just finished reading the Birthmark, and the first thought is the striking parallel between it and Poe's Oval Portrait. Both protags are obsessed with (i) their wife's beauty, (ii) their chosen vocation. And the mix of the two is equally deadly in both stories...;Nice article, though I didn't care for the catchy title.  JK Rowling is doubtlessly a well-read woman, and her references to other works of literature are subtle, seamlessly incorporated into the text, and help us relate to her work more, even if we can't put our collective finger on why sometimes.I feel like collecting all the influences of different pieces on HP would be a curious  endeavor. You all have spotted some good stuff; then there was this idea with elf servants being released when their hosts give them clothes in Grimm fairy tales. When I was recently reading Oscar Wilde's fairy tales, the Remarkable Rocket stroke me as very obviously Umbridge. Personal collection growth :)Love this course!;Additional Introduction is available here. I flipped through the rest of the text, and it doesn't appear to have any changes compared to the 1st edition at first glance...;I read the 1818 version from Gutenberg which does have the preface... this one.  No spoilers :)Anyway, it's included into the 1831 version;Though peer reviews do happen to be bipolar on occasion, is everything in fact about them? The exercise of analyzing a book, picking a topic and arguing it in concise form should improve both one's understanding of the material and writing by itself - at least, I feel it does to me. Constructive critique is an icing on the cake, not the cake itself.My latest batch was overall the least encouraging of all with some comments that without examples I have no chance to fully understand. Nevertheless, I feel I've learned from it the most, and my ego will recover soon enough :);Now, when we are three essays into the course, it seems like high time to ask about the general approach to writing different students use.Those who have had recent experience of similar writing for your studies / job: do you apply what you've learnt from there to assignments here, or do you go crazy while you can?Those, for whom this course is a fresh start / reprieve from routine: how do you decide what to write and how?Does anything change in your writing from unit to unit?;Answering my own questions: since formal education in my country prefers collection information over interpreting it or making personal opinions known, this experience is quite new to me.The first essay was about a notion common to many fairy-tales ('cause I was too afraid to pick one - what if that was not the right thing to do!), didn't provide quotes, but used five additional sources, and was so formal, one of the peers said it resembled an encyclopedia article - and so it did :) The second one concentrated on one scene in Alice, interpreted it in a crazy way no one seemed to expect, and was sliiiightly less formal. The third one was a compare-and-contrast, as informal as I dared... and now I want to try something else entirely!  ;Very interesting take, Kevin! Prof. Rabkin did hint at possible unreliable narrator in Frankenstein too. And you have good arguments.As for counterarguments, I also thought of Victor's alibi for William's death first thing. However, since everything we know about it we know from Victor... He does plan on going home about that time in any case, so maybe he manages to go and return in time to receive the letter?The trial over Clerval's death seems very fishy. It's postponed for the period of Victor's illness (a few months), which makes his witnesses' memory quite remarkable - I'll admit I wouldn't recall having an inane conversation with someone or other at exact time few months back.The weakest link, I believe, is sailors spotting someone before they meet Frankenstein. Unless, despite the unlikely place, it's just anyone... Some Russian bear hunter :)Good luck!;The topic is very interesting, but are you sure the time frame is right? According to wikipedia (not the most reliable source, I know, but worth double-checking), Mery went to Switzerland, where she wrote Frankenstein, with her little son she'd already given birth to after the first baby's death. Both her half-sister and Percy's wife committed suicides a few months later. I was using a biography with large chunks from their journals (on Gutenberg) for my essay, but didn't get this far.;I dropped by the bookstore on the way to work today, and on a whim bought Kafka's collection. Then I got to work, and saw this awesome doodle, which kindly informed me of the anniversary! What kind of magic is that?So far, I love interactive ones the most, Turing's being the favourite. But this one is very cute :);"

Will have to wait almost 2 months till our Independence Day :);This is indeed an interesting challenge, I might take part if time permits.However, Florencia is right in that it's a task quite different from what we do in our assignments. In our essays for the course we need to provide some additional insight to what is in the book. We don't have to worry about spoilers either. In this ""promo"" essay, we'd be supposed to intrigue more than anything, to explain what we like about the book without disclosing some crucial points... which might as well be what we like there the most!;It seems logical that since we receive 5 reviews by default each (unless one of our reviewers doesn't submit his/her assessment), we are expected to dish out 5 of them too. Each review you don't complete is one person who receives one review less, while you likely still get all 5. Sounds unfair, doesn't it?As far as corrections go, are there any repeated patterns or mistakes which don't let you understand what the person actually means? Comment on them first.;I was taught throughout my formal education that a research that is shorter than 10 pages is too short to offer any insight. Stuffing all I want to say into 320 words is one thing, choosing a topic that would be specific enough for this to be even in theory possible is a great challenge to me. But no learning happens without a challenge, does it?;I didn't look to deeply into this point, but actions of the character in your example don't seem without logic to me. Twisted logic of a person with a mental disorder, but logic nonetheless.You know this feeling when something gets on your nerves? Be it a new clock which ticking you aren't used to yet, so it sounds deafening in the dead of night, or a person sitting at the next desk in the library and beating some rhythm with the pencil against the desk. Usually, we either get used to the disturbance or move away irritated. The character of the Tale tale heart seems capable of neither, and prone to hallucinations to boot, so he finally loses it. At least, this is the way I see it. Though I'd love to learn what kind of disorder he exhibits, and how Poe knew enough intimate details to built such a persuasive PoV...;Thanks for the link, this does seem part of what the guy experiences.I agree, not being able to rationalize contributes to the horror. To me, it's also the thought that this can happen to anyone anytime: without symptoms to spot, we can suffer from people we have trusted for a long time... and that's where paranoia is born ;);Not sure which one was the first: there have always been some random collections of short stories at home. I know that I read Alice in Wonderland and Fellowship of the Ring before school, and Martian Chronicles were part of the school program... Then, there's  Kir Bulychov, of course - with his series of novels and stories about a girl from the future called Alice. Still love them to bits!;It's been quite educational to encounter well-placed references to notions and sources I didn't encounter before, so far as their points of relevance have been explained. Every essay that broadens my view is truly appreciated.However, today I've come across a different matter: two of the essays assigned to me refer to Poe's  The Masque of the Red Death in a way that presumes I've read it and is supposed to get what is said at once. But I didn't, since it isn't in the list of the assigned reading. Is it? This is a short story, so I'll certainly try to read it and evaluate those works before deadline. However, I find myself dismayed by such attitude of the fellow students. The workload is quite heavy  as it is  for someone who has RL stuff going on too, like you know making a living...What do you think?;Wow, didn't realize this problem would be so common... which is a sad trend.@ Florencia, neither of mine is only about this story, but both use such particular details for arguments, that they don't make any sense to me at all... Though you are right about comparing our texts to widely known works of literature - we certainly have been pointed at many links to the Bible for one, good point.@ Jeremy, definitely a  plagiarism check is in order (though neither essay looks really brilliant, so I honestly doubt anything particularly incriminating will pop up). I would have read this story back in school, but it's been good fifteen years, so the memory is hazy at best. I've been planning to finish Portable Poe - there's a lot of really good stuff there. After the course though, not right here right now...@ Megan, yep, a bit irritated. I'd love to have written on  The Pit and the Pendulum, but alas :)@ Sean, your irony may become prophetic o.O Though outside of the course, that's an interesting idea :)@ John, Javier, you have got to be kidding!;Quite right!

But since I want to do better, there goes. Any comments are appreciated.---  Beautiful garden in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story  Rappaccini's daughter  is clearly meant as a representation of the garden of Eden     being called so on several occasions within the story. Yet, having resulted from creative efforts of a man, this version of Eden is as warped as the broken fountain in its center.  An    Adam    Dr. Rappaccini has created assumes the shape of a beautiful girl     a child of his blood, and thus his image to the largest extent possible for a female. Her mother is never mentioned, but assumed, to lend this creation the credibility of a natural deed (lacking in Victor Frankenstein's endeavor) along with the feel of God's single-handed creation. Being apparently a benevolent creator, Dr. Rappaccini grants Beatrice an unspoken wish for a mate, making an    Eve    out of whoever she likes best      male as per reversed fictitious reality.  Beatrice's unnatural talents, and the way Giovanni appears to be lured into the garden makes us associate her with a poisonous snake. Indeed, akin to an animal, her deadly ability is only a natural instinct she cannot be held accountable for, while her inner nature is pure. Dr. Baglioni on the other hand is the real seducer     jealous and vindictive, he slithers into Giovanni's confidence and slips him the deadly    apple   .  The distribution of roles in the story makes for an ambiguous impression:    God    creates a menace to human lives for purposes undisclosed to the reader, whereas    Devil    thwarts his plans for selfish reasons, ultimately ending up with a result that probably benefits the humanity as a whole. In this skewed reality, we see that man dabbling in God   s business is so much of a threat to the natural order, that a malignant character is portrayed as one to restore it.Form (2)peer 2      An interesting essay that flows well but there can be improvements. The last paragraph should not be one sentence. I suggest the word ""largest is not proper in its usage.peer 3      Your essay is well structured, but you could have outlined better the logical links between the different arguments.peer 4      I think the language usage is correct. There are coherent transitions between paragraphs.Content (2)peer 2      I thought the analogy to the garden of Eden was good and the analysis find support in this weeks lectures. However I think you are to kind to the benevolent creator, Dr. Rappaccini There is evil or misplaced morality in using his daughter and as the subject for his experiment and turning her into an agent of death. (Re: After the comparison with Frankenstein in the previous sentence, ""benevolent"" refers to Rappaccini's indulgence of his daughter, where Victor rejects his creature. It appears I wasn't clear on that, thanks for pointing this out)peer 3      Your interpretation of this tale is quite traditional but solid. Why don't you try and make it deeper next time? I am sure you can find more to this tale than an explicit analogy garden/Eden (Re: As I didn't read any critique of the story, I didn't realize this was a traditional view...)peer 4      The comparisson to the Garden of Eden and its analysis as an inversion helps the reader understand better the text. The idea is persuasive and well explained. (Re: Thanks!);Could never fully get the hang of those pesky articles :) it's good to have someone point out when they are misused.

If you allow yourself to stay calm and take the critique in the spirit of learning how to make your writing better, then you will have accomplished your goal. Your writing will improve. It is easy to get upset, but counter productive. Good luck with your writing.  ;I believe that the point of having us critique each other's essays is that we learn as much or more about writing by looking at each others work,  we do from our own efforts at writing. No one thinks that any of us are truly qualified to give an accurate critique, but we gain so much from trying. Again, the grade really doesn't matter. ;I laughed out loud reading that scene, and I never got it when reading it as a child! ;Did anyone else struggle with the word limit this week? I think I may have had difficulty because the book uses such beautiful words and turns of phrases that I was trying to write in the same style and found myself with 400+ words and I wasn't done! I had to really work to get it down to 320, and still say what I wanted to say! ;"

The ideal Victorian woman puts the needs of others before her own, always.

Love and lust had very little to do with marriage . ;I have visited Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary, several times. It is really beautiful, and some of their customs are very different. For one thing, they do have a reverence for relics of the dead. In the churches it is not unusual to see skulls on display. There is a monastery in Budapest in which the ceiling is made up of the bones of the deceased monks. To an American, this seems a bit macabre, but there, it is a reverence for the saints and completely natural. ;Yes there are relics in American Catholic Churches , but they are not on display as they are in Europe. Also, a relic doesn't have to be a body part, it can be clothing or papers that belonged to the saint. Most Catholic Churches have statues, such as Mary, or Joesph and the crucifix. ;Joshua, you are such a good writer that I would urge you to continue if you have the time.

Kathleen, I will be retiring from teaching soon. I have to go a short way into next year and am retiring mid-year due to my husband's poor health.

Throughout history, and today is no exception, people always have strived either to have more, or to have something better than what we have. Aylmer had a very beautiful wife, but wanted her to be perfect, so he sought to use his scientific skills, which he knew sometimes failed as is the nature of experiments, to make her perfect. If he could have realized that what he had was so good that he should be content, then he would have achieved what so many of us never do, which is enjoy what we have without trying to make it more or better. ;Oh, I think it clearly was an abusive relationship.  ;Agreed! The chance to have these discussions is amazing! We all benefit. What we gain is perhaps a new way or ways of looking at things. In the autobiography of Ben Franklin, he talks about a group of friends who would get together and read each others' works and discuss and critique them. He credits that little society with sharpening his mind and improving his writing. This is exactly what this course is. It's wonderful! ;I have to say that I am loving this class. Some of the books I have read before, but many of them I have not. I think we began with Grimm's and Carroll because science fiction had their roots in those writings and other similar writings of their time. It's like starting a unit on Rock and Roll by listening to Moody Blues and slave work songs. At first blush they may not seem related but that is the music from which R&R came. You have to know it to really understand the genre. ;Yes, you can choose just one story if you wish. I have loved the readings, especially Hawthorne's short stories which I have never read before. I am writing about Poe's ""The Bells"" because it is such a dark view of life. ;I think it could be a representation of her one imperfection, and that all mortals are, by definition, imperfect. By removing her birthmark, he took away that which makes her human, so she had to die.  Could it be the hand of God? ;This story really speaks to me, because it tells of how difficult it can be to nurture an artistic spirit when so many do not understand the value of art for art's sake. It also speaks to our need for approval which just stops us in our tracks sometimes. We need to pursue what interests us because it interests us and not care what anyone else thinks about it. I loved this story.  ;I hope I get to read your essay! ;It says something to the effect that""the reward of high performance must be sought within itself.""  I don't think the artist needs our sympathy, because, in the end, he achieved his goal; he made his beautiful butterfly, and it was a total success. He was not searching for glory or riches, only achievement. Through much of the story, he was hoping for Annie's approval, but even that, he ultimately realized was not important. ;Intrinsic motivation is the hardest concept to get across to elementary age students. So many children are looking for a tangible reward, (read ""bribe"" ) and have not discovered the joy of learning just because it is fun. That is one of my goals as a teacher is to help kids experience the joy in learning! ;I thought that the image on the box was Owen himself, a boy chasing a butterfly, just as he spent his life chasing his artistic butterfly.  ;Hawthorne's English is a more formal language than is used in the vernacular today. It was difficult for me, especially at first, but Kindle has a built in dictionary that helps with some of the vocabulary. As I got into it, it became easier. I loved his beautiful stories. ;Proficient is in this case, used as a noun, meaning, scholar, or expert. The word is not commonly used that way today, but would have been understood at the time. ;I read it as ""prominent scholar"". ;By the way, do you all know that the Kindle reader has an attached dictionary? It is very helpful for such readings! ;What do the points signify in the forum threads? ;Thanks! That makes sense. ;"

Nunez had heard the tales of the community of the blind, but the community had never heard of the outside world. They perceive Nunez as an idiot, because they don't believe that it is possible to be anything other than they are.  I do think it is interesting that in all four stories the protagonist sees himself as far superior to everyone else, referring to mere mortals as fools. Domination of others seems to be a common desire, and they all go down in defeat.

Here's your chance to fire back at a reviewer!;Well, I suppose it's only fair!   ;-)Throughout  Alice   s escapades in Wonderland and the Looking-Glass, she is bombarded  by a strange array of characters speaking in riddles and preposterous  phrases.   The nonsensical fashion in which these characters speak  parallels regional dialects and points a satirical finger at the  breakdown in communication that occurs from differing dialects; forcing  the reader to contemplate their own use of language and colloquialisms. Posed with a seemingly impossible riddle and assaulted with frenetic  conversations, Alice is quickly entrenched in the whirlwind madness of  the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.   To both the reader and Alice, the  Hatter and the Hare appear ridiculous and non sequitur in thought and  speech.   However, this proves to be par for Wonderland and the only  confused parties are Alice and the reader. Communications are further  complicated by the Hatter and the Hare   s inability to understand Alice   s  particular phrasings.   She is told to    say what she means    as her word  choices and sentence structures are analyzed in the most literal of  senses.     Alice faces a similarly bewildering exchange with Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking-Glass.    Her simple questions are referred to as    riddles    and, much like with  the Hatter and the Hare, her unassuming responses are taken literally  and misunderstood.   Anyone who has attempted a conversation in a language other than  their native tongue   or even with those speaking a varying dialect of  their own   may relate to Alice   s experience.   Standard colloquialisms and  idioms are often misinterpreted under these circumstances.   To say to a  non-English speaker,    My computer has given up the ghost    may lead them  to believe my computer is inhabited by a spirit of the deceased, rather  than that my computer is no longer functioning.        Carroll eloquently and humorously reflects the flaws in language and  the difficulties it presents through the fantastic and ridiculous.    Despite our differences and erroneous communications, Carroll unites the  human experience through the observations of the Cheshire Cat.   Perhaps  we really all are mad here.  ;"

There are a lot of other, newer lenses to analyze texts from, such as reader-response, Marxist, structuralist, etc...just in terms of literary theory. I am curious about newer psychology and neuroscience theories that could be used to analyze these texts. Would you share some? Thank you!  ;Javier,  I don't know about Lauren, but I, as a woman, do not feel uncomfortable dealing with Freud at all. You should be careful with generalizations of that magnitude. Some  people,  both men and women, might be uncomfortable with those topics for personal reasons, but please don't generalize like that. It's a little offensive.  I do agree with you that both the fascination and repulsion/discomfort around Freud's topics have something to do with very primal human instincts that are often repressed by societies in one way or another.  And as for Mr/Ms Anonymous, take a chill pill.;"

Ever since I got my first computer and internet connection, I've been fascinated by the vast amount of knowledge available, but it was always a little overwhelming. Having a structured class definitely helps. Oh, and I am totally addicted. So far, I've signed up for Introduction to Guitar, Song Writing, Intro to Music Production, The Modern and the Postmodern, Ser M  s Creativos, Survey of Music Technology, The Ancient Greeks, Modern and Contemporary American Poetry, A History of the World Since 1300, Crafting an Effective Writer, Egiptolog _a, Nanotechnology: The Basics, and Confronting the Big Questions: Highlights of Modern Astronomy. I'll be taking 1 to 2 classes a month with all these from now until February, but I'm already looking at other MOOC websites. I think a MOOC intervention will be in order soon lol.   ;I received the following comment on my essay for the Hawthorne and Poe unit:    ""In Professor Rabkin's 'Hawthorne and Poe: Before You Read Unit 05.01' video lecture, he discussed the idea of common features and differences that demonstrate different ways of knowing in Hawthorne & Poe's writings. Therefore, my understanding was that this week's essay was a compare and contrast exercise. Also, your intro and concluding paragraphs are consistent, however they are too short and need more development.""I thought that while the ""Before You Read"" videos were supposed to give us some guidance and what to look for, it was up to us to decide what we should write about. I haven't seen it specified anywhere that we should write about what Professor Rabkin highlights in his introductory videos.  As for the last part of the comment, I would gladly have expanded on everything if we didn't have a word limit.  I appreciate people taking time to look at my work, but I just wonder about the way they grade. I know there are several threads concerning the peer review method, so let's leave that one alone, but what do people think about my first comment?  ;"
