            <string>My name is Mary and I work in publishing, live in the remote Overberg area of the Western Cape, South Africa. I&apos;m looking   forward to deepening and extending my   knowledge of science fiction and fantasy, as well as participating in an online learning community.;Hi Derek -- I live a couple of hours inland from Kleinmond and it is beautiful!;Just popping into unclick my   thread subscriptions because I have too many updates coming in -- sorry for the digression.;I&apos;d say that whether it&apos;s widening horizons or cheating depends entirely on how you use the material you find!;If I was studying this properly at university, I would use as much other material as I felt necessary to write a good essay, as long as it is well referenced in the footnotes. ;Wow, this sounds like a really cool tool but it doesn&apos;t seem to work with my linux computer. Is it restricted to Windows?;I love to write, but I have no formal training in creative writing, so everything ends up sounding very academic.   I would very much love to give and receive feedback with other aspiring writers!;I just can&apos;t pick a favorite, the Grimm Brother&apos;s stories were also my bedtime stories and the ones I would usually ask for. Though I first knew some of the not so &quot;dark&quot; versions of the tales. Some of my favorites are    One-eye two -eyes and three eyes(one of my top favs),  The Bremens Musiciand, the fisherman and his wife, rumpelstilstkin, hansel and gretel, cinderella, snow white, and the list goes on and on... I just love them! They are still my favorites.;</string>
            <string>I have read &apos;the Bridge&apos; and &apos;A song of stone&apos;. Both impressed me so much! Bethan, thank you for showing Banks&apos; site - now I have plenty to read. I&apos;m very sad about his death, 59 years is too short life for such person :(;Actually, intertextuality is a common practice if one studies Fairytales as a genre. Not only Rosetti and some other victorian writers practiced it, but also contemporary writers such as Angela Carter or A.S. Byatt.  ;That is such a useful reminder Joe -- I was thinking last night about lines from a poem by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht that carry associations of emerging from a dark and even monstrous primaeval place:I, Bertolt Brecht, came out of the black forests. My mother carried me into the cities while I lay Inside her body.  And the chill of the forests Will remain inside me until my dying day.Because as Sara Maitland notes when she explores the remnants of 12 British forests in Gossip from the Forest, these great dark   woodlands were home to   folklore characters like woodcutters, wolves, witches and   lost or feral children. I liked her retelling of fairytales too, the uncanny in a modern spin.The forest in many fairy tales is the   northern European forest of oak, pine and beech, filled with wild creatures and birds, hidden streams and   thickets, clearings with   old wells or   peasant cottages, the hiding place of robbers and bandits, a place   of secrets and   seasonal changes --   healing herbs and acorns or chestnuts for food, disorientating at night, hidden and dark, filled with shadows. It is also a place of transformation, with speaking animals, characters who are disguised or masked and not what they appear to be, roads that   lead   nowhere, paths that   offer danger and opportunity., untamed wilderness   A magical but threatening landscape -- and similar to mountains or lakes as places where   change takes place. or where worlds collide as an encounter between reality and   magic.;Good to find this thread -- I began working on a closer look at Rumpelstiltskin and   as I read more deeply and widely about the four older tales adapted and synthesised   into the   version published by the Grimm brothers, I   felt increasingly troubled by certain aspects. The miller&apos;s daughter agrees to give her   first-born   child to the   gnomish and cunning small man who   in return will   spin   straw into gold and save her life,   ensure her marriage to the king. She is in turn deceived and placed in impossible situations by her boasting father, her future husband and the   stranger who   appears to help her out.   Very typical of the   beautiful woman seen as helpless, unfortunate and depending on a rescuer of some kind. Why does this stranger want her child? A number of critics   commented on the widespread fear of   children or new-born infants being stolen, abducted, bought or lured away as having to do with Germanic   anti-Semitic   scare stories about Jews who would use the blood and   parts of the child&apos;s   body in obscene and devilish   rituals. Rumpelstiltskin was also often shown as a &apos;despicable dwarf&apos; and prejudice against the disabled was widespread.When I was young I read and   enjoyed all these stories in a naive way and this course offers the opportunity to deconstruct   that naivety.   I&apos;m glad of the critical awareness and shared discomfort   shown here   by other participants. Many of us   write and work in the   SF/F communities and   there is   still far too much   stereotyping in   fiction and uncritical appreciation of   writers like Burroughs, Lovecraft and others with attitudes that   need to be recognised as deeply offensive.;Ursula Le Guin&apos;s work is groundbreaking and   marvellously imaginative. In fact I don&apos;t think   I have ver found a particular emphasis on sex. Her slipperiness around gender was a unheard of at the time, long before Judith Butler. When I turned the page of a Le Guin novel and   read &apos;the king was pregnant&apos; it felt as if I was entering another universe of possibility.;When I first read Bruno Bettelheim   s Uses of Enchantment, the   idea that the darkness and cruelty found in many fairytales and legends was in some way cathartic influenced my memories of   stories that had enthralled and   terrified me. Bettelheim suggested that fairy tale themes of abandonment, torture, violent death, witches, and grotesque   injuries gave children the opportunity to deal with deep-seated fears in a symbolic way. I   m no longer so sure about that and Betteheim   has been discredited in many ways as a theorist. At the same time, I   dislike reading    sanitised    or   tamed-down versions of   the fairytales I   heard and read as a child. The power of fairy tales is both   sinister and humorous,   dark and   hopeful by turns.  Reading through the   Household Stories this last week, I found myself wondering about traces   in them to do with histories of suppressed trauma. The     recurring preoccupations with food and shelter   may date back to times of famine or pestilence, the   mention of   soldiers or weapons to do with   European   feudal wars, the journeys undertaken may have to do with refugees   in flight or   homelessness after villages had been burned down or cities occupied by   foreign armies. The   vulnerability of orphaned children and young women is a persisting theme. Although the original   trauma may not be mentioned directly, I sometimes felt that some kind of tragedy, economic catastrophe or rape had triggered the   &apos;story behind the story&apos;.Freud   argued that    violent experiences are not registered consciously because  the subject does not have the psychic resources to process them,    which is why trauma is displaced, erased and   often only   found in traces or symbolic gestures that point back to what might have happened. The history of   northern Europe is a bloody and   unstable record from medieval times   through the   Renaissance and into the unification   struggles of the 19th century.    I   d like to hear if others have   wondered about this?  ;The issue of what children &apos;should&apos; or &apos;shouldn&apos;t&apos; read is a separate issue altogether. For most cultures you&apos;d need a pedagogy that deconstructed   Hollywood appropriations before foisting Disney on children!Jen, I worked on Georg B _chner&apos;s   play Woyzeck (1837) a while back and that had a &apos;marchen&apos; or &apos;fairy tale&apos; that was   frightening and   eerie, a glimpse into the   underbelly of German militarism and working-class poverty, the anxiety of rapid social change across Europe at that time. But it&apos;s probably fair to say that throughout world history children from poorer families haven&apos;t been protected from the realities of   struggle, violence, danger.   A friend of mine in a   disadvantaged community school in South Africa   was telling us how the smaller children pretend to be boy soldiers in the Congo who   kill adults and   hide in the forest.   This might be the genesis for   a fairy tale or myth, a story that begins with play-acting to defuse fears.;Thanks for this link -- this is what I was hoping to find by enrolling in a MOOC for the first time this year.;I first encountered this   Victorian/Edwardian prurient fascination with small girls when I read the diaries of the Revd Francis Kilvert, a 19th-century vicar who   kept a diary while working on the Welsh Borders. The descriptions of landscape and   seasons were beautiful -- that nature writing the Victorians did so well. Kilvert was a young bachelor who married a   woman his own age and then died of peritonitis after his honeymoon.His interest in   little grils was creepy and fetishistic. He would beg them for kisses,   fondle them , spy on them   wait out for them and   stalk them ( in modern terms). His diariy entries refer frequently to &apos;caresses, loving looks, lap-sitting, and romps&apos; with pre-pubescent girls. I doubt he   ever sexually molested them ( he may have been saving himself for marriage and   might have had a Christian respect for their virginity) but his infatuation with them was intensely amorous. and intrusive. His &apos;gaze&apos; is always objectifying and possessive. He wanted to sketch them as   Lewis Carroll sought to   photograph them or   recreate them in literature. Kilvert was not ashamed of his passion for little girls but   exercised caution around   their hawk-eyed mothers. He preferred the company of children to that of adults.Very much like what we know of   Charles Dodgson. Like Dodgson, Kilvert found sexual innocence or purity to be erotic in itself. The Victorian idealisation of   young children centred on their   uncorrupt and   innocent beauty, their sweet obedient compliance with adult demands. The pedagogy of the   era was punitive and   conformist.   Few   parents or teachers had   any idea of a   child&apos;s right to any kind of autonomy or privacy. Children were whipped, starved, locked in rooms until they repented and &apos;behaved&apos; themselves, sent away to boarding schools, threatened with   disinheritance if they did not satisfy their parents&apos;   ambitions for them.   At the same time,   adults could relive their childhood feelings and   naughtiness   through play with children, a way of returning to   childhood Eden. Showing   physical affection to children was   more acceptable   than   touching, hugging or kissing   adult family members or   a woman to whom one was not formally engaged. Victorian society was an extremely repressed middle-class milieu with a thriving underworld of   brothels, adultery,   kept mistresses and pornographic fantasy. Other   Victorian public figures who showed the same   infatuated amatory interest in children included   Baden-Powell (his   encounters with his boy scouts make for quesy reading), JM Barrie, John Ruskin.How acceptable was this behaviour? I suspect many of their contemporaries   thought it immature, peculiar but not criminal.;I have read through and   evaluated three   essays on the first assignment and   all of them were more than 1 000 words in length, far in excess of the   word count given.Because this   is the first assignment, I am not penalising those who over-write but please   let&apos;s keep to the word count!It is inconsiderate to send in lengthy essays to evaluators who have five assignments to   read and   limited time. More importantly, it is unfair to those students who   made the effort to edit and cut their work down to   320 words or fewer. Those of us who work in media know it is much easier to write 2 000 words on a topic than 500 words or 200 words! Harder decision have to be made and   details have to be excluded.By writing   assignments of between 270 and 320 words,   we are learning to be concise and succinct in argument.;I checked the word counts each time by pasting them onto an MS Word program. You know, I don&apos;t want to discourage people who worked hard at   the first assignment and   this course is   done mostly for personal enrichment. So I didn&apos;t downgrade those who had exceeded the   word count. I also   didn&apos;t mark down those   struggling with written English.   In my home country we have many   students for whom English is their   second or third language, so we are able to   guide them skilfully following adult literacy principles. I   would like my evaluations to encourage those Coursera   participants for whom English is not their first language to   keep expressing themselves while pointing out some   of the more serious mistakes so they   can   learn from the essay feedback.The   evaluations are far more time-consuming   than I expected and   to read lengthy essays, correct   and explain language errors, and then comment on   the level of critical analysis will take several hours   each week. There should be a realistic   guide to this time-commitment   for those beginning   the course. Participants who have not already read the   books   to be studied are looking at a heavy workload with all the evaluating to be done.;</string>
            <string>Thanks Patricia, I&apos;ll do that. I had assumed other evaluators were having the same problem.;I have read through and   evaluated five   essays on the first assignment  and   all of them were more than 1 000 words in length, far in excess of  the   word count given.How did this happen?;Asking again for STAFF to reply to me here -- I am not going to continue with evaluating for the next assignment until I understand what happened. The essays I marked exceeded 1 000 words in length -- I checked this and   those who received comments from me would have noted my comments on length.;Hi Patricia -- someone   PM&apos;d me from the Facebook site and   the problem was my Samsung Android. There was extra text but generated by my own program. Very weird.   Thanks for responding, I&apos;m&apos; still baffled and glad I didn&apos;t mark anyone down. My comments will be off-beam but that would hopefully be offset by other evaluators.;Greg, I worked with the Sumerian myth of the descent of Inanna for a slipstream fantasy novella I did in 2010 (I publish under pseudonyms for genre reasons). I find that layering mythic aspects into a   story resonates even when the symbolism isn&apos;t explicit. And often the associations come up quite naturally, echoes of   something we   read as a child or dreamed about. Our imaginations are mythopoeic.Have you read Angela Carter&apos;s fiction? She   has reinvented many   older fairytale elements and pushed imagery of the circus to   bawdy burlesque --   Jeanette Winterson does something similar in her fiction too. Then there&apos;s Jane Smiley&apos;s A Thousand Acres -- I was well into the novel before I realised she was rewriting Shakespeare&apos;s King Lear and it   sent chills up my spine.   I am also thinking here of Iain Sinclair&apos;s psychogeography of   the London underworld.;Greg,   I see you write for a YA market, so consciousness of reader reception would be   uppermost. My notions of reader expectation or comprehension are   much vaguer! The   editor inhouse got my allusions and liked them, and that was good enough for me. I was writing about a character who goes on a potholing expedition in which an underground cave is discovered. There is a flash flood and someone drowns in the cave. A year later my character is recruited to lead a geological survey team to   the melted and exposed rocky territory undergoing development in the Antartic. She   realises she is being stalked by someone from the potholing group. Now the myth of Inanna has to do with Inanna being stripped down to psychic nothingness as she goes   down into the Underworld. Once there her sister   has her murdered and hung on a meat hook.   In my fiction, I used these elements of being stripped down -- losing torches, losing   contact, electronic   aids failing, losing a protective helmet, losing   the sense of direction and   even a sense of self. And in that increasing disorientation and darkness there is terrible violence that is also vengeance for a stupid   mistake that cost someone his life a year earlier. The imagery came to me   instinctively because I love the myth. Then I began weaving it into the fiction little by little. Some of it worked better than other aspects.[Sorry for such a long post -- I hadn&apos;t thought about that story in years!];I   signed up for this thread because of my interest in science fiction/fantasy and   so I have decided to look at the   symbolic Vorpal sword in Alice Through the Looking Glass for this week&apos;s assignment. There is so much   to explore in Lewis Carroll that I felt I could do an entire course on his work alone, but the Jabberwocky is a nonsense poem I   learned by heart years ago and   was intrigued by what a Vorpal sword might look like.  One, two! One, two! and through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.   Are there any other sf/f lovers who have wondered about this iconic sword?;Sean this is not just bloody brilliant, but BRILLIG!Dodgson/Carroll said   himself he had no idea how he arrived at the   term &apos;vorpal&apos; and the word play has been done by scholars who like acrostics or   word games. Not altogether convincing. The   Vorpal sword is more neopagan or medieval fantasy   than gospel. The   word &apos;Vorpal&apos; is perfect for a 21st-century post-Star Trek, post -Bradbury-Asimov-Le Guin understanding.What does Tweedledee say? &apos;If it ain&apos;t Vorpal, it ain&apos;t dead.&apos;Where does the Vorpal sword come from? The Mad Hatter tells Alice that it was stolen from the White Queen by the   Knave of Hearts, who comes across as an undiscriminating kleptomaniac who&apos;ll pinch anything of   sentimental or   real value. The White Queen safeguarded this massive unwieldy sword with its   notorious power of beheading.Where is the   sword now? Stashed away in the castle of the Red Queen who   has a fetish about beheading.What   does Alice have to do before she even begins to tackle the question of handling   the Vorpal sword? She has to   find the White Rabbit (that unpunctual mentor)   who will show her the way to a small building guarded by the Bandersnatch. Alice must retrieve the eye of the Bandersnatch, so she runs to find the dormouse who may still have the eye. (The eye here has an elusive quality not unlike the   smile of the   vanishing Cheshire cat.) Alice will have to cunningly steal the eye from Mollymkun and restore it to the Bandersnatch who will then   let Alice have the   Vorpal sword.The powers of the sword are limited. It has no mundane or useful uses, it would seem. Alice can&apos;t cut the bonds of the Mad Hatter and free him. She can only kill the Jabberwocky.The Jabberwocky as poem not monster has to be deciphered as a magical reverse text, the code to do with a   magical verbally concealed   Vorpal sword. Alice encounters chess piece characters. In an inverted world or back-to-front dreamscape, Alice   has to read the reflection   of the   baffling text as   mirror-writing. The Vorpal sword&apos;s origins may have to do with its ability to snicker-snack, relating to a large kniife known as a   snickersnee. The poem Jabberwocky comes out of language   that is carnival or burlesque and   singsong nonsense. The   poem Jabberwocky is an incantation, a way of   conjuring up a battle that will go on and on even though the Jabberwocky has been beheaded many times.Who is the Jabberwocky&apos;s true enemy?   ( This from Tim Burton&apos;s   imaginative film Alice in Wonderland.) the Jabberwocky confronts Alice in battle Alice, he quotes &quot;Ah, my  old foe. We meet on the battlefield once again.&quot; When Alice states that  they have never met, the Jabberwocky says, &quot;Not you insignificant bearer. My  ancient enemy, the Vorpal One.&quot;;Well, so long as we footnote it, we can draw on popular culture too, Florence.   Creative approaches aren&apos;t discouraged.;Thanks for the link John -- love those nonsense words. &apos;O frabjous day&apos; was a family saying at home.;Alice and game theory?;a Victorian clergyman in a waistcoat brandishing an unreliable   stopwatch. &apos;Bless my whiskers,&apos; he cried out,&apos; All this clamour for forum attention. Beware the Whitherstumpher&apos;s new crescendo...;I&apos;m also wondering what this has to do with the course. Self-promotion   that has nothing to do with the purpose of the forum is   bad forum etiquette.;You&apos;re not alone Stephanie, I&apos;m a bit &apos;vampired out&apos;, but I do recall being fascinated by parts of Stoker&apos;s novel before and hope to   feel that way as I read tonight and tomorrow.;Greg, you&apos;re right! Dracula is so modern. I&apos;m blown away by the skill and   narrative power. It has pages that are trashy pulp (I quite like them) and all kinds of short cuts, but it is so clever in places.;</string>
            <string>Well, not as deliberate as that   Greg, but I understand the slipstream/speculative possibilities,   likely market and what   small publishers or   ezines are looking for. I don&apos;t   write much fiction -- most of my work is commissioned non-fiction, but I understand the genres I work with. I wouldn&apos;t say the myth made it easier but it did enrich my writing.There was something the   sci-fi writer   M John Harrison wrote   in   a Guardian review about the tension between the   Unconscious, irrational and creative material surging up and needing to be controlled by conscious intention that says a great deal to me about how some of us work. Images and metaphors appear and can be extended or deepened, so long they don&apos;t slow the pace or   distract from the narrative arc.;Hi William and thanks for the feedback. The key thing with writing fiction for me is that every element or   metaphor   needs a reason to be there and has to work hard to move the narrative forward. The symbolism should feel as if it belongs, occurs naturally. ;Good to hear from you Luisa -- so much to work with in African folklore, isn&apos;t there? I studied the griot traditions of West Africa (the novels of Chinua Achebe touch on these).;That sounds exciting Luisa -- you mentioned many of my favourite writers there.   I&apos;ll have a look at your website and leave   contact details.;Julieta, I was also fascinated by the different styles of communication -- diaries, letters, falsified letters, business letters,   cryptic notes, newspaper articles. And the speed and urgency astonished me for a Victorian   novel.Then there are the medical discourses and rituals of exorcism. So on the one hand there are those   largely undescribed blood transfusions (three hearty men giving their blood to Lucy) and   whacks of morphia prescribed. On the other hand there are   golden crucifixes, the sign of the cross being made, garlic garlands to repel vampires, a wooden stake through the heart and   beheading. Medicine works a little. Religious and   folkloric rituals work in extremis. And then there is the   treatment of   &apos;madness&apos; or &apos;lunacy&apos;, the   asylum and constraint. Oh and then the &apos;Just Married&apos; lovers&apos; discourse set in opposition to the irresistibly seductive and corrupt Count Dracula and his erotic vampirism. I can&apos;t get over how much   Stoker packed into   this novel and how   skilfully he brought such disparate elements together.;I hear you, Lauren. Most of   my post-grad work   dealt with Lacanian and   Kleinian (Object Relations) insights and   I&apos;m used to post-Freudian studies, more to do with Judith Butler&apos;s Gender Trouble or   post-colonial deconstruction. A little   puzzled by the   uncritical approach to   textual analysis here.;  Really enjoying this thread. There are   layers of subtext here that intrigued me. Because the homoerotic content is unconscious and   possibly unintended by Stoker, it appears only indirectly and   for me it would seem to be coded as taboo or forbidden -- to   perform oral sex on a man or a woman would be forbidden, to drink or swallow ejaculate semen would be as   taboo as drinking blood, The &apos;little death&apos;, the swooning or fainting might be read as a trope for orgasm. There are the gothic undertones -- the religious extremism of   gesturing with crucifixes, the   quest for exorcism, the   superstitions of medieval   belief, the implied cannibalism of   consuming the   host as Body and Blood. The language of constraint -- women locked up in bedrooms, drugged unconscious, drained of vitality, the asylum, the   crazed craving for   torture, flirting with revulsion (rats and   flies), obsession with corpses, hints of necrophilia. If the reader wants to detect forbidden tropes or subtexts,   you need to read counter to the text, against the grain in many ways. If we look at the figure of Dracula, the   intense   relationship he has   with Jonathan Harker could be contrasted with the   hostile and   mercenary relationship he has   with the three female vampires. Jonathan belongs to him first and foremost, he will enjoy Jonathan before the   females can taste him. To counter   the corrupt Count, you find male bonding   between the men who are suitors for   the affections of   Mina. The men undergo another   kind of blood bonding via their transfusions under the tutelage of   Van Helsing. Lucy   is filled up with blood and revitalised   by each of three men in turn, they could all be her husband. Polymorphous and perverse! This is a   book that draws on Swinburne and anticipates the decadence of Wilde and Beardsley, or perhaps   Baudelaire and Rimbaud.   &apos;The love that dare not speak its name&apos; cloaked in   toying with bisexuality and   voyeuristic sadism shown towards the   sexual lust of   vampiric women. Nothing overt, but   we didn&apos;t have to wait until Anne Rice came along to find eroticism and taboo in   Dracula.;Yes, we&apos;re looking at pre-Freudian fiction here and   that is where the Unconscious has full play because although Stoker would have moved in a society brimming with hidden and   underground sexual modalities, none of this could be stated directly and he would not have set out to inscribe   what   would have shocked or repelled his readers. It is there though, the   lushness of description, the   play on gothic and perversity -- much more than   just homoerotic symbolism.;</string>
            <string>Greg, I think I posted elsewhere that I   found the different styles of communication media so skilfully done -- I could imagine a 21st-century character   texting as he walks down the   street, going into a restaurant and Google Glassing the place for celebs, using his   laptop on the   Tube to post on a manga or anime mailing list, popping into his bulemic recovery support group in the downtown clinic and   glancing through the clinic newsletter asking for blood donations, getting sexted by his ex and unsure how to respond, walking out into the street again and finding himself   in the middle of a   crowd of protesting activists sending one another Twitter updates -- you&apos;d get the same speed and urgency, the same confessional or epistolary flow.;Efthymia, I found this very interesting -- the scandal of Oscar Wilde&apos;s arrest and details   emerging about his affair with   Lord Alfred Douglas caused consternation in   England and on the Continent. If anyone wants to read up further on this, I&apos;d recommend Colm Toibin&apos;s The Master which is fictionalised but very close to what probably happened in Henry James&apos; circle of friends, which had included Oscar Wilde and Andre Gide. James himself was seen as &apos;an eligible bachelor who showed no intention of marrying&apos; and had several men friends who identified as &apos;inverts&apos; or &apos;Uranians&apos; until the Wilde scandal made it unsafe   for anyone to   associate with known homosexuals or show sympathy for Wilde. I imagine Stoker was forced deeper into that imprisoning closet along with many other men!One term or concept I find useful when   referring to the undercurrents found in   late Victorian literature is &apos;queer&apos; because that carries connotations of not just   homosexuality but   the desire to experiment with forbidden identities and lifestyles. There&apos;s a new book out I&apos;ve just ordered, Where Thy Dark Eye Glances: Queering Edgar Allen Poe edited by Steve Berman (Lethe Press, available from Amazon).;I agree about JG Ballard, not just Crash. I&apos;d like to think that responses to essays would be open to   more revolutionary or subversive readings, but I&apos;m not sure that is realistic.Under my study window I have a shelf of what I think of as subversive, transgressive or controversial fiction: Thomas Bernhard, Elfriede Jelinek, Michel Houllebecq, Robert A Heinlein, Georges Perec, Sylvia Molloy&apos;s En Breve Cartel, M John Harrison&apos;s Empty Space, Clarice Lispector,   the early Thomas Disch, Kathy Acker, Roberto Bolano&apos;s By Night in Chile. Just for starters!;Predictably Stranger in a Strange Land from Heinlein. Subversive is an odd word and many people have differing notions of what is disruptive or outrageous or transgressive.;Great stuff Sean, nothing like a feisty provocative essay to get the mind working! Lucy in Blooferland. Your reviewers lacked any sense of irony, which is always the risk with literature courses.Yes, yes, yes, I noted that damning reference to Ophelia (and remember that   Lucy&apos;s father was a sleepwalker, not a good omen), but what about the doppelganger or twinning of   Lucy and   Mina, the light and dark twins? Mina doesn&apos;t   flirt with three men and   accept transfusions from four, she instead asks herself:    What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days?    Lucy is Dionysian by night; Mina is chaste and   that   brings her respect from the   men around her, she   is able to think ahead because even when under the   hypnotic spell of Dracula&apos;s power, she   protects the men around her from any contamination, she   acknowledges her branding (Hawthorne&apos;s Scarlet Letter again).Once licentious Lucy the New Woman has died and   been ritually mutilated to ensure she loses   her Undead allure, the sexually reticent Mina comes into her own. Mina is Lucy with enough   prudence to avoid the   Fall. ;Right now I&apos;m wrenching myself away from   Bram Stoker and   immersing myself   In Mary Shelley., but still fascinated by threads on   Carroll&apos;s Alice and Grimms&apos; fairytales.   I can&apos;t wait to see what   the discussion threads will bring up next. Like many of us, I&apos;m working extremely hard and having a great time. I don&apos;t know I&apos;d have tackled this reading list on my own, and to read alongside so many smart and thought people is a huge plus.Yes, the peer reviewing is something of a lucky dip. My feeling is that   MOOCs are just getting off the ground and there is quite a steep learning curve underway. Not unlike   writing forums four or five years ago,   cluttered up with unskilful and unrealistic posters floundering, expecting overnight fame and   worrying about plagiarism.   Now there are a   number of published writers grateful for   the forums&apos;   input of   agents, editors and   beta readers as well as stimulating conversations. A learning environment is the best place to make friends. And it would be such a pity to   complete a course like this without enjoying the process --;I&apos;m participating -- I   write my weekly essays on themes or topics that fascinate or intrigue me and I hope will interest the reader,   then   sit lightly to the responses though I&apos;ve had some   very perceptive comments.   I read carefully through essays written by others and spend   time giving feedback in evaluation. But the real engagement is with the books themselves and the discussion forums.;William, I agree, and   since you are an aspiring writer you&apos;ll find this   kind of   succinct writing exercise very helpful when it comes to sending synopses to publishers or writing &apos;pitches&apos; for agents or just anticipating criticism of your written work.One   big issue with peer review is   learning to accept criticism from readers from many different backgrounds with   different expectations and   varying skills when it comes to reading. We all want an ideal reader, someone who &apos;gets&apos; us the first time, someone   whom we think is &apos;qualified&apos; to judge our work ( like a lecturer or professor). We want &apos;fairness&apos;, we want reasonableness, we want someone   just like us to read and   praise or encourage us. What we get is a mixed reaction that   pushes us to work out what is helpful and what   is not, how to disregard flattery and write more authentically, how to deal with rejection and keep working, keep taking risks and do the best we can because our own self-esteem as a writer or reader is not bound up with   acknowledgement from others. Invaluable stuff --;When I choose a topic, I focus on   a theme or   point of interest that   fascinates me and it is great to have the freedom to do so. But essay-writing is all about communication, so I try to make the theme or argument as lucid, contextual and interesting as possible for the reader.;Interesting post David -- although I do think Mary Shelley was not writing a romance but a novel in the gothic tradition and so the love interest was not as important to her. She was the daughter of a famous if impecunious   philosopher, William Godwin, and   her circle of friends and family   (including her   poet Husbnd percy and   Byron) had been discussing &apos;galvanism&apos; which was a scientific or pseudo-scentific   notion of animating matter, drawing on old myths of Prometheus who fashioned   beings from clay   and the idea of the homunculus as well as the golem. We&apos;d   call this kind of novel a &apos;novel of ideas&apos; and that interests me in terms of scientific fiction because many science fiction novels are about the science of the future or ideas about society, about scientific discoveries that change society and the nature of relationships.;Yup, rather too much like life that way. We want a   scripted Hollywood   pace or   modern novel scenario, plotted for ease of reading -- and instead we   get   something that reminds us of life?Mary with tongue firmly in cheek.;Yes, a great quote and that   particular maturity of   Mary Shelley is   very much of her time. I&apos;ve been working on an essay to do with the metaphor of   childbirth, the images of gestation, miscarriage, labour, stillbirth -- the many   conflicting and fertile aspects of creating a novel like Frankenstein -- and,   of course, this 18-year-old woman, unmothered and   who had grown up with an impecunious philosopher father had been through so much already. She was recovering from   childbirth and her baby daughter had died. She was   pregnant again and afraid she would not deliver a healthy normal   child, even as she wrote about   creating a monster. Her beloved half-sister Fanny had recently   killed herself and so had her husband Percy&apos;s ex-wife Harriet. All around her was uncertainty, grief and   new possibilities,   the excitement of creativity, the risks of leading such an unconventional   bohemian life in Geneva (she had run away with her poet at the age of 16 and her father had disowned her).And all of this dangerous knowledge and   the risks of travelling far from the security of her hometown would go into   her   novel.;I find this thread interesting -- would an artificial being   always be monstrous because he or she is not human? It isn&apos;t just being large, or out of proportion or threatening in   appearance,   it is   an unsightliness that marks the creature as Other., as not one of us and   unable to belong with us. The fear that he will mate and reproduce his own kind is why Frankenstein destroys the unfinished   female   creature. Humans cannot live with the inhuman.The paradox of course in that the   monster is one of the most   human creations in the book, he has pathos and yearnings and   his loneliness is akin to our own. Asimov&apos;s thinking desiring robots owe a great deal to Frankenstein&apos;s monster.;Thanks for this William -- fascinating perspective;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m with you there, Joseph. &apos;Literary&apos; can be much broader than just imagery or metaphors. That essay sounds fantastic.;And I&apos;m very   pleased I did push you Sean -- onanistic creative surges indeed! Seriously, this makes for a thought-provoking read and I liked the way you put   the quotes in the referemces to give yourself more space for your argument.There&apos;s no guarantee here that any of us will   get   even three or even two peer reviewers who are on our wavelength, creative, adventurous, erudite, etc. These essays though offer an open-ended opportunity to push the envelope for ourselves, to stretch ourselves and test   hypotheses for our own satisfaction. The discussion forum threads are a much better guide to   topics and cutting-edge ideas than the format suggests. It isn&apos;t about learning to   dot the &apos;i&apos;s and cross the &apos;t&apos;s for academic referencing. Nobody in their right minds is going to take a marking system   done in an   ad hoc fashion by unscreened and unsupervised peer reviewers to be on a par with accredited academic pass rates. These courses are for personal enrichment and that is the real potential. I&apos;m looking forward to seeing what you do with the dipsomniac morbid genius Edgar Allen!;It is such a subtle and   enchanting story -- I would never have   read it if it weren&apos;t for this course. For my essay I looked at New England Puritanism in the Dark Romantic   fiction of Hawthorne and Poe, but there is so much more I would love to explore. In this story Hawthorne sounds very like the early   Henry James whose   work I love with a passion.;It makes me sheepish to admit this, but I came to sci-fi very late. When I was doing O-levels we   had a collection of science fiction stories and the English teacher   dismissed them as a novelty, not serious literature like DH Lawrence or Hemingway. I   remember most of the sci-fi plots to this day and there was a   Bradbury story there. I loved John Wyndham&apos;s Day of the Triffids and the Midwich Cuckoos but couldn&apos;t really   understand Asimov or Brian Aldiss. And then I was in my 30s and in bed with flu and   found myself given Ursula Le Guin, Joanna Russ, Kim Stanley Robinson and I   hated them. Felt   baffled and couldn&apos;t   work out what   and why these writers were doing this kind of thing.One night I was travelling on business and   unable to sleep in my hotel room so I watched a   klutzy BBC mockumentary on a city under a dome on Mars, walkways and artificial pools, theme parks, shopping malls, and my blood ran cold. I lay awake all night making up a story about a society of Mars dwellers trapped in a kind of condo paradise, no children being born, no way to tell the time (all clocks banned), days of shopping and   aimlessness. A custom-designed society in stasis that is suddenly invaded by   feral drug-crazed teenagers in stolen space ships.And   after that I was ready for the mind-bending fantasies of sci fi.;Inspiring thread, thanks Megan.When I&apos;m   reading the   fiction texts, I jot down lines that strike me and my   reactions to certain themes or   characters. Then I   think about what   upset, or amused, or   moved me. A theme for an essay emerges and I take a   large blank sheet of note paper and   doodle around, images of tiny hands, coffins,   ineptly drawn roses. A design for a stop-watch. I look at what puzzled me, at what resonates,   list words and phrases that keep coming back to me. I sometimes do some extra reading, think about the lives of Hawthorne and Poe. Think about the   time and place in which they wrote.Then I go away for a day or a few hours and   come back and see what has coalesced, what is glowing for me. Has a new theme   been born on the page?   I draft out   a few paragraphs and   submit in case my   computer crashes and I   never get another chance to   submit. Later I come back and   look at what niggles me.   I rewrite and   restructure. I   look at   my last line, how to sum things up or leave things dangling. I listen to some classical music and   then Appalachian Spring. Some jazz.   Coltrane, nothing too attention-grabbing. (I listen to music in between bouts of writing, prefer to   write in silence.) I sit in the bath and   wonder   what I would boldly write if I had to   bring my not-quite-finished essay to life and give it pizzazz.I sit down and   do my references or footnotes. I give my essay pizzazz so that it   stretches its new wings and flies around the room a little. I murder a few darlings with a small axe, lose a   favourite sentence that   sounds a little too precious or obscure. I make some green tea and   imagine that I am a friendly stranger sitting alone in a   quiet apartment reading this essay. What might NOT make sense? I   murder another &apos;cute-sounding&apos; phrase. The   essay is done and flies out of the window, cawing like a pregnant stork rather than a raven.;</string>

            <string>Meg, I spent most of the first 14 years of my life near Atlanta (Woodstock, to be specific), and then moved to Michigan&apos;s thumb. I feel like all we did was switch places... lolWhen back in Atlanta, if I&apos;m not careful, I pick up this unique Midwestern nasal-y accent with a slight hint of the southern twang. It sounds just as weird as you&apos;d think it sounds. On that note, never had an accent until I moved to Michigan...;</string>
            <string>Hi Meg and Everyone.   I am Jenny Williams.   I, too, grew up in Michigan and now live in Georgia.   I lived in the Atlanta area for about 6 years and moved to the Georgia Coast about 20 years ago.     My work as an education consultant affords me the possibility of traveling across the US quite often, so I was in the Detroit area in March.   The lack of snow really surprised me, but just as my plane cleared the runway for departure, the flurries began to fall.   I look forward to chatting and reading with everyone during this course.   I love to read and write, so this was the perfect way to begin my experience with Coursera.       ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m Laura and I&apos;m in the Atlanta area as well - I live in Decatur and work downtown.   My accent is all kinds of weird though. I&apos;m a Chattanooga native, but throw in 4 years in Maine, 3 in NE Ohio (Youngstown, an hour from Cleveland, an hour from Pittsburgh and an accent all it&apos;s own), 3 in Tucson, but stints in the Nashville, TN and Jackson, MS areas and I don&apos;t know what I sound like anymore. :) .     Despite time in OH, I&apos;ve got no love for Ohio State (my team is the TN Vols, even when they&apos;re not doing so well)Megan, if you can handle the desert and the heat in the summer, Tucson is actually great for wheelchair users, I&apos;ve heard, though I have no personal experience - but there&apos;s almost never snow and rarely rain. ;</string>

Menstruation in ancient cultures came with lots of mystical qualities. I wonder if those customs are reflected in these stories. And to continue with the topic of threes, in Jewish/Hebrew symbolism there is an entire area of study devoted to numerology in the Torah (bible). This is an excerpt from Wikipedia:The number three  was the symbol of holiness. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and  the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten  times three ells  in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt  offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice  three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had  three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,[3] and in the invocation of God the word &quot;holy&quot; was repeated thrice.;</string>

            <string>James, I think the blank page is slightly terrifying to all writers. Some of us try to fill it as fast as possible with every observation we&apos;ve ever had about the text (me) and some of us throw down bullet points and then struggle to figure out how we can elaborate on what we just said. I know the pain of the latter problem, because I used to be that way, too.I don&apos;t know if this will be helpful for you or not, but I&apos;m going to try something I&apos;ve never done before vis-a-vis essay writing, inspired by Dr. Rabkin&apos;s examples - I&apos;m going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I&apos;m finished with the book, I&apos;ll have a list to cull and expand on. That way, I won&apos;t get stuck by being too literal (as often happened to me when I was struggling to fill the page), but I also won&apos;t be tempted to throw every possible theme and plot point at the wall in an orgy of self-satisfied personal discovery.At least, that&apos;s the theory. I&apos;m not sure how well it will work, because I&apos;ve never taken notes *as* I read before. I know that&apos;s probably heresy to many in this class, but the physical act of writing is difficult for me due to congenital disability, and my mother raised me to believe that the greatest crime in the world was to &quot;deface&quot; a book - so the combination of the two meant stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.And in case anyone needs it, here&apos;s one of my favorite quotations from Aaron Sorkin, one of the greatest writers in film and television still alive today:     I love writing, but hate starting. The page is awfully white and it says, &apos;You may have fooled some of the people, some of the time, but those days are over, Giftless. I&apos;m not your agent and I&apos;m not your mommy: I&apos;m a white piece of paper. You wanna dance with me?&apos; and I really, really don&apos;t. I&apos;ll go peaceable-like.   I love that quote because it illustrates that those first panicked moments when you feel like you have nothing substantial to say and can&apos;t possibly fill the blank space with anything meaningful afflict even the most celebrated of writers.;Hola!

            <string>Karen, it&apos;s been 14 years since college for me - and I had to take a medical withdrawal, at that! But I still break out in a cold sweat when I think about doing literary essays. I can write the heck out of any other kind - historical, sociological, scientific, whatever, but literary essays - ack. I remember angrily telling my mother that university was an upperclass game this working class kid didn&apos;t know how to play, because when I asked my professors what they expected, the answer was &quot;you&apos;re in college now, you need to figure that out yourself.&quot; To which my mental reply was, &quot;I&apos;m paying $20k a year and you won&apos;t even tell me the rules?!&quot; Like you, age and experience has taught me that the problem was *those particular professors* (who, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a stretch to say, looked at what was then a 16 year old kid in a wheelchair who was only able to attend thanks to scholarships, decided I didn&apos;t belong there, and did their best to make me feel unwelcome) - not my scholastic ability. I now know that if I ever attend a school where the answer to &quot;can you please clarify the parameters of this assignment?&quot; is &quot;figure it out yourself,&quot; I am at the *wrong* school for me and need to get out of there! At 16, I just didn&apos;t have that kind of self-confidence.I, too, am loving the clear expectations here. I don&apos;t need or want to have my hand held, especially vis-a-vis writing of any kind... but I *do* need to know what kind of a goal I&apos;m shooting for, and I think Prof. Rabkin has set that up beautifully.I&apos;m reading once for pleasure and bullet points, a second time for more detailed notes with Dracula, The Left Hand of Darkness and Little Brother, because those are the ones I&apos;ve never read before and I have the good fortune to be a very quick reader - the others are both shorter and not new to me, so I&apos;m hoping to dive right in with more detailed notes from the start. I already devoured Little Brother in an hour last night (how have I not read any Cory Doctorow before now? He reminds me of Vonnegut, one of my favorite writers of all time), so I&apos;m hoping my &quot;pleasure&quot; reads of the others will go similarly.My &quot;critical reading&quot; glasses are still a little dusty, but I think Prof. Rabkin has set us all up for success - that&apos;s becoming a familiar feeling with Coursera courses, something I never had at my brick and mortar uni!;As a writer, I can absolutely agree with the blank page fear that occurs when you try to start writing something new. Whether it is in electronic form or traditional pen and paper, the white page is an enemy to be slain. I have a tendency to over-write in my beginning process just to get rid of the vast openness of a new page. I will doodle or freewrite or outline, whatever I have to do to feel more secure and safe from the scary first step. It often times ends up looking like a disastrous mess, but it is something! I find that, especially when typing rather than handwriting, just typing as much as you can as an initial thought is very relieving. It is much easier in a word processor than on paper because you can toggle where you want to write next, be it in the middle or at the beginning or in place of something less worthy. Eventually you can shape your jumbled mess of thoughts into something far more gratifying.  ;Although I agree with many of the different views here, my primary concern is that I don&apos;t want to risk &apos;programming&apos; my own way of thinking about a book. I think of it in terms of classical program music; if you are told what the music is supposed to represent, your experience is guided and it becomes more difficult to come up with your own ideas. Like Megan, I will await a response to this question before doing any background reading. I might even avoid reading introductions in the books themselves as I have learnt from experience that sometimes they contain spoilers! :o);Thanks for this, I&apos;ll try it out on Thursday.;Oops.

On that website there are several formats available, such as PDF, ePub and MOBI. ePub will work on almost all eBook readers. MOBI will work on a Kindle. There is also an HTML and plain text version, both of which can be read on a computer if you do not have an eBook reader.I had a similar question about the selected readings for this unit, but I believe the selected readings are actually all of the tales in this translation (not just some of them). If this is incorrect, please feel free to update my understanding.  Happy reading, and I look forward to more interaction here in the forum as well as in our peer reviews.;I&apos;d argue that science fiction, like all literature, is evolving. Authors like China Mieville (who just happens to be on the tip of my brain at the moment....) are taking the concept of science fiction to interesting places. For me, science fiction&apos;s appeal lies in its ability to examine how people are/could be given the addition or removal of technology. The &quot;weird fiction&quot; catalogue fascinates me.... While some sci-fi holds over time, much doesn&apos;t. I&apos;ve been pondering what gives &quot;staying power&quot; and what dates.... My current thought is that the author&apos;s ability to tell a story that reveals an aspect of humanity is what makes excellent science fiction... Regardless of where Real life science has taken us.... So awesome sci-fi continues to be born..... Just my two cents...... ;Since I&apos;m only 14, my argument might have a lot of holes in it and can be easily crushed, but I agree with Matthew. If you take something like Star Wars, which can be technically be called science fiction, and an episode from the ninth,  tenth or  doctor in television series Doctor Who, one can clearly see the difference. While Star Wars has many elements that can&apos;t be directly explained by science, like the force and hyper speed, the tenth doctor explains werewolves as alien parasites, robotic men as being a type of vessel of immortality, and  zombies as being an accident concerning medical nanobots, which  are fantastical elements that can be explained with theoretical science. In conclusion, the genre of science fiction has indeed evolved to rely less on completely fantastical elements. Casey and Matthew,  feel free to correct me.;My favorite Sci-Fi author has always been Philip K. Dick, and largely that&apos;s because of the reasons he has for using technological explanations for things he can&apos;t actually do. He often describes technology that we actually have today, but didn&apos;t when he wrote of it originally. He was a paranoid schizophrenic at the very least, and had to be able to explain not just (Fantasy) that &quot;they are monitoring him,&quot; but rather (Sci-Fi) how they are monitoring him. If you remove the technology from his stories, they don&apos;t revert to being some sort of Fantasy story, but instead they fall apart completely - the Technology is a character, and needs to be built just like every other character.As far as the Pern books, those seem almost like they&apos;d be right at home in both Sci-Fi and Fantasy. If you remove the technology, the stories don&apos;t fall apart but they are no longer the same stories. Pern without technology and science becomes something more similar to Xanth, where everything simply is.I feel like the major difference is similar in nature to the argument between Science and Religion (entirely over-simplified, anyway) with one explanation trying to say exactly how everything was done, and understand it; the other to look at it with awe and wonder. Sometimes, telling a story without explaining the impossible events pushes the story along, and I&apos;d think of a story like that as being Fantasy.When it&apos;s all said and done, the two genres definitely have some overlapping room. I would imagine that&apos;s why this class seeks to study both.;I think exactly like you about that &quot;uncanny valley&quot; feeling because of the fast science and technological progress. What I think has happened to SF is that it has become more difficult to write when focusing on tech and &quot;action&quot; more than philosophy and character struggles. I find Neuromancer&apos;s ending every bit as appealing now than 10 or 20 years ago, the CODA is just filled with bitterness, but I think that TV and movies SF has been obeying to Hollywod standarsd (mostly) which ends up offering lame remakes of the same ideas.SF&apos;s real challenge is to begin dreaming again of the (for HIMYM fans) possimpable. I mean, SF dreamt so much time with many of the things that we have now, or see in the near future, that we need to, once again, propose the &quot;ridiculous&quot; stuff that will question our very own humanity as many authors have done (Gibson and Card are some contemporary examples of this done effectively IMHO).What do you think?;I lament that I can only read English, because it definitely hinders my ability to have a wide-range of source material to build my notions from ...;Karen, yes, I do! :) Pester away. Be warned that I know little about the actual coursera site, though - I&apos;m more a hardware/software/OS/accessibility tech geek than a coding/website geek, so any queries about the platform itself are best directed to the appropriate board. While I&apos;m here, the best free screenreader of anything you might pull up in a *browser* that I&apos;ve found is Chromevox, located here: http://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/It&apos;s a browser extension for the Chrome browser, so it&apos;s got a fairly small footprint and does a decent job. Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t help with navigating your actual operating system, so anything *outside* of your browser (switching tabs, opening programs, using a word processing document etc) won&apos;t be voiced.Similarly, there is a Firefox plugin that has the same benefits (and caveats): http://firevox.clcworld.net/Macs have a program included in the Mac OS itself called VoiceOver, which is far and away the best screenreader that one can have outside of JAWS - it reads anything on the web as well as anything else you&apos;re doing on your computer.Windows has a free OS based screenreader too, but it must be downloaded separately, and which screenreading extension to download depends on which version of Windows you&apos;re running. Some of them are better than others. None are great.There are tons of screenreaders for Linux, but I don&apos;t use Linux, so I&apos;d have to ask my buddy who does for his recommendations.Hope that helps anyone who might need such info.;I suggest you look into Audible for future reference.   It&apos;s an Amazon company that offers audio-books for a subscription.   I&apos;ve downloaded the Android app, but I haven&apos;t actually used it yet.From what I saw this evening, I don&apos;t think it would be cost-effective for you for this class, as it limits subscribers to 1 book per month.   I looked up Frankenstein and one of the other novels for this class, one was $20 and the other $25 to purchase for immediate use.   I would not choose to drop ~$200 to read books for one free class.;Hi guys! Will we be using the course wiki? How does it work?Thanks;I think you have a great thesis. I haven&apos;t paid attention on social statuses while reading the tales because my mind was focused on some other stuff, such as step-mothers and why they are always evil. But what you say obviously seems true and I think you should definitely write about the social status of men.;Thanks for the resource. I actually just wanted to share my thoughts. I&apos;m only now working on the actual essay. But your input has been really helpful.  ;You were actually more helpful than you think. ;);I wanted to pick up on Karen&apos;s thought about &quot;luck&quot;.   I had a professor who showed us the difference between the concept of &quot;fortune&quot; in Medieval times versus the concept of &quot;fortune&quot; in the Renaissance Era. These stories   are essentiallly Medieval folklore but were complied by the brotheres Grimm in the early ninteenth century. The medieval concept of &quot;fortune&quot; is a &quot;spinning wheel&quot; and mankind has little influence on their own fate. The Rennaissance concept of fortune, thanks to Machiavelli&apos;s The Prince, was that man could make his own fortune and could, to some extent, control his own destiny. I certainly see the medieval &quot;spinning wheel of fortune&quot; at work in most of the stories. Just a thought I wanted to add since Karen brought it up.;I agree with you, my mind was going in the same kind of direction.I haven&apos;t read all the stories yet, but I&apos;ve noticed how the message seems to be in some of them: if you want to outstand a noble/king while you&apos;re of lower birth, you&apos;ll have to be smart.I can take the examples that stricked me so far:- &quot;The Rabbit&apos;s Bride&quot; - I feel that the Rabbit is the representation of the Lord who takes a part of what his farmers produce and can take a lower born girl if he wants. The girl sacrifize herself to save the garden, but gets away with a clever idea.- &quot;Six soldiers of fortune&quot; - The 6 soldiers punish the evil king by joining their very peculiar forces. Being written after the French and American Revolution, I wonder if there&apos;s a linked message of the power of the People over a king if he&apos;s not good enough???- &quot;Clever Grethel&quot; - obviously gets away from his master by a clever twist ;-);I tend to distinguish Science Fiction from Fantasy based on whether it deals more with technology, or more with magic.   So if you like role-playing games, I would classify Shadowrun as Fantasy due to the magical elements, even though it also includes a Cyberpunk / high-technology world.Of course, the quote &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is virtually indistinguishable from magic&quot; is relevant, and allows the issue to be confused.   I&apos;ve seen convincing arguments that Star Wars is more fantasy than science fiction, both because of the Force and the strong Jungian archetypal themes.So I think that Utopian and Dystopian novels could be either SF or Fantasy.Are you familiar with S.M. Stirling&apos;s Emberverse?   It begins with more of a Science Fiction flavor, and in fact the Nantucket side of the story (&quot;Island in the Sea of Time&quot; and sequels) continues with a historical fiction / science-fiction time travel flair.However, the United States / Washington State side (&quot;Dies the Fire and sequels) of S.M. Stirling&apos;s story quickly becomes dystopian in the first few books.   I still think of the first set as Science Fiction, as it often deals with the technology of survival.   But by the second set of books, the story has become high fantasy, echoing old legends.Eric Flint&apos;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; series is another time-travel / historical fiction, that includes significant discussion of technology.   Even the act of displacing the town in time is explained as alien technology, not &quot;magic&quot;.   Therefore, I would classify it as science fiction.   But I think I&apos;ve digressed, since I don&apos;t think this series is particularly utopian yet (nor dystopian, but these stories lean hopeful, pointing toward an eventual utopian future).I would classify LeVar Burton&apos;s dystopian novel as science fiction, since it deals with technology and a near-future time.   But &quot;Elementals&quot;, by Morgan Llewellyn, I&apos;d call fantasy.Similarly, I would call &quot;The Handmaiden&apos;s Tale&quot; a dystopian SF, but &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot; by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden&apos;s Tale.;The boundaries in writing tend to be fairly fluid in my opinion, especially the further you get from fact and into the realms of the fantastical.   Genres are not so much boxes that contain and limit  as they are  puddles, reaching out and melting across attempts to  define borders.  Sci-fi/fantasy is particularly good at this because it&apos;s a built-in mechanism, anything is possible from imagining King Arthur  returning to save England in WW2, to  Joss Whedon&apos;s Buffy and Firefly series. One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley&apos;s Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently &quot;lost&quot;.   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as &quot;science&quot; ie &quot;matrix technology&quot;  with &quot;technicians&quot; and &quot;monitors&quot;.   When they are &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the more traditionally  technology-dependent Terrans of the original Earth, tensions ensue around multiple issues, including the consequences and ethics  of embracing certain advances.   For example, &quot;blasters&quot; are  banned by Darkover  as they  confer a greatly enhanced advantage to only one opponent; by using bladed articles only, each combatant must place him/herself in danger of injury or death, therefore meeting on equal ground.   With regards to medicine, yes, Terran practices can do wonderful things, such as improved  hygiene and the dispelling of harmful superstitions; but a midwife points out the downside  could include  a newborn with a heart defect who survives through such intervention will require greater care through life, and even pass on the defect to its offspring, requiring yet further intervention; widen that to the population as a whole, and the difficulties become swiftly apparent.   These questions also apply to the Darkovans.   Crucially, their  &quot;matrix technology&quot; is itself  linked to biology;  &quot;laran&quot; as it is called, is a genetic trait, with a physical presence in the  brain; and their society continues to  suffer from previous generations&apos; attempts to  control and develop ever stronger talents through human breeding programmes which of went horribly wrong.      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the &quot;real world&quot;,  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Right, that&apos;s my two cents!   :);Sounds like I will have to check out this &quot;Darkover&quot; series...thanks Christie!;Though the barrier between &quot;genre&quot; literature and mainstream literature is vague, it can never completely disappear. The best sci-fi and fantasy might be chosen by time and promote as the classic ones while the others are left behind and forgotten by the readers. There are some fantasy novels influencing the mass medias significantly now, but I don&apos;t think it means that these books are the first rank. The meaning of the distinction between &quot;genre&quot; books and mainstream literature is obvious, which is to pick the best ones and discard the mediocre ones no matter whether they are sci-fi and fantasy or not.  ;Wow. I didn&apos;t expect to get so many answers with so many good recommendations.  @Karren Abbott I&apos;ve recently started reading The Hunger Games. I am on the last book, actually. I avoided them for a long time because YA books get popular and then you read them and they&apos;re awful. But I was very surprised by these books. Totally not what I was expecting. I thought the movie was really awful though. The thing I find interesting about them, maybe I&apos;m alone here, but they&apos;re subdued. You know all these terrible things are going and you keep thinking &quot;Just defy the Capitol! GO!&quot; and you know they are but at the same time it&apos;s like you&apos;re slowly creeping around the corner to get that monster and it&apos;s just so calm about it. Maybe it&apos;s just me but I just got this subdued sense of urgency from the books.  I know it&apos;s not a book but has anyone seen THX 1138? It was a student film George Lucas did back in 1971. It&apos;s actually pretty good.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138;Thank you for the essay. I know you haven&apos;t read it but they do get into the PTSD in the second book. A lot of the kids don&apos;t actually go and kill anyone. A lot hide and just get killed. Very few actively kill. They actually bring this up in the second book (I read the first part of the essay. I&apos;ll have to read the whole thing when I have time, so I don&apos;t know what all they&apos;re saying in the essay). SPOILERS AHEAD: In the 75th Hunger Games, it&apos;s called the Quell and they do something &quot;special&quot;. Well, that year they draw from the pool of victors in each District. One of them remarks to Katniss that they all wouldn&apos;t be here if they didn&apos;t have a killer instinct. Basically that not that many people would/could actually kill when they&apos;re put into the situation. That we&apos;re not all like that. That&apos;s one point I have a problem with straight out that the essay says.  They actually mention a girl who won simply by hiding for the whole games. She never killed anyone. Also, at the beginning of the games, there&apos;s this place that they all start out in and they&apos;re in a circle around it and at the center is weapons, food, medicine etc. But the catch is, all the strong, well trained ones go for it. So, you can risk your life or head for the hills. Generally around 11-13 people die in the first few minutes. Only the strong or afraid survive.  Sorry, I really like these books and I think they make a lot of good discussion points, whether you agree or not.  ;It is true, Rebecca, that fairy tales have simple narrative structures, as do comic books, TV series and serial novels. These structures make them easy to follow   and probably made them easy to remember and enrich when they were part of the oral tradition.  But doesn&apos;t their main attraction lie in the wondrous and magical worlds they portray? ;I&apos;ve been thinking this over for several days, and I&apos;m not sure how clearly I can articulate this thought yet, so pardon any rambling.I do not enjoy Grimm, and I never have; not even the sanitized versions. However, I *do* get that comforting dopamine rush when reading (or hearing, or reciting) an *Irish* fairy tale - and I&apos;m not sure why that is. I grew up on Grimm and Irish tales in equal measure, so it&apos;s not that one holds more nostalgia over the other. The Irish archetypes are not that different from Grimm; threes are prominent, so is nature, the same class issues abound, and on and on. But for some reason, when I *think* fairy tale, I think Cuchulainn, or Fionn MacCumhail and Benandonner, or the Salmon of Knowledge, or The Children of Lir... but if I pick them apart, they hold the same kind of morals and the same general take away messages as the Grimm tales do. I suppose on the most simplistic level, I find Irish fairy tales more interesting or more enjoyable... but I can&apos;t even deconstruct why *that* is.I am almost afraid to think about it too much, lest I get distracted from what we&apos;re *supposed* to be writing about... I&apos;d much rather deconstruct the Irish ones!;Hitler came much later than the Grimms and German nationalism, so you might need to revisit that hypothesis.   Remember, &apos;Deutschland ueber alles&apos; meant &apos;Germany as a whole comes before Schleswig-Holstein&apos; before it meant &apos;Germany conquers the world&apos;.;It may be partly about the memory of being read to. Read these tales aloud to someone else, and they take on an entirely different quality. There&apos;s something very dreamlike about them, some mapping onto the unconscious even when we&apos;re annoyed by the amoral or malicious character coming out on top, or a repetition of ridiculously rigid gender roles, or the apparent lack of logic.;I would offer another perspective. We love these stories, in a way that we don&apos;t (some could say can&apos;t) love other stories. If for no other reason than these were given us at developing periods prior to critical analysis, of both literature and our world in general. They speak to us because they have become archetypal and fundamental. On a quick aside, I once heard a literary anarchist (I forget the fellow&apos;s name) in Berkeley who spoke of the pagan roots of Disney&apos;s versions of the stories, he said that Disney was the most counter-cultural icon in the 20th century namely because he got &apos;Christians&apos; to love old pagan tales...an argument could be made in many regards his assertion (for instance the initial artwork added Christian images), but I&apos;ve always found the idea compelling (much in line with JK Rowling&apos;s, Potter series as well).;</string>
            <string>I had the opposite experience.As a kid, I would read the SF&amp;F shelves in the children&apos;s section of the library (aka, the YA section).   As I approached adolescence and found I had read most of the books on the shelves, that&apos;s when I started drifting to the adult SF section.Unfortunately, one of my favorite YA SF writers was Robert Heinlein.   I quickly learned that his adult books were, well, adult.   I was a lot more cautious in the adult section after that, but I did go back.As we moved around, I made a point to check both sections.;Re: The Handmaid&apos;s Tale genre, you make a good point.I&apos;m reminded of another distinction that I often use for SF and Fantasy:SF usually / often occurs in the future, when space travel goes between star systems, or on alien worlds.Fantasy often occurs either in the past, other universes, or on worlds where the technology level is approximately Earth-medieval, and the astronomy of star systems / constellations are not relevant.Of course it&apos;s not as clear as all of that.   Anne (&amp; also Todd)   McCaffrey&apos;s PERN novels are a hybrid - Dragon&apos;s Dawn and similar first-pass stories I would call SF.   The Lessa &amp; F&apos;lar stories begin as Fantasy but with the discovery of AIVAS become more SF.   Most of the stories in between those two poles (Nerilka&apos;s Story, Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, much of Todd&apos;s co-authored books, Moreta, etc.) I would classify as more Fantasy, because they deal with dragons and a medieval-tech world.Honestly, I always considered Speculative Fiction to be a meta-category, one that includes SF, Fantasy, Horror, Historical Fiction, some Mystery novels, and probably other categories I haven&apos;t thought of.;I am in the same boat. I think I am seeing the end of the tunnel and then an avalanche of books happens. Not a bad thing though. Honestly, I had been against reading them since they came out. I read the first one on the recommendation of a trusted friend who also had the hangs up about PR and what not. I devoured the first book in a day and it brought up so many points, at least to me, that I just kept talking to people about it. There&apos;s definitely more to the story.  ;I would agree with Rebecca - your comment is very insightful! I don&apos;t think that when the Grimm Brothers were writing they were only focused on one particular point - morality or trickster (while I think your recognition of the fact that the tales are composed of many genres helpful!).   When I read the tales I get the overall sense of a fantastical commentary on humanity, the times in which they lived and the societal realities in which they inhabited. In reading the Six Soldiers, one of the main themes appears to be that in order to get justice from an unjust King - authority figure - the common and honourable man (the soldier committed his duties well according to the beginning of the story) must band together in order to successfully receive what was due him (the gold at the end which was split between the men can be seen as the well earned retirement of the leader).   Thus, that tale can be read as social commentary on the hierarchal realities of that time. While others - such as Aschenputel, extol virtues that were considered important and are more reminiscent of a morality tale, and still others like the Rabbit&apos;s Bride are more reminiscent of warnings, or recognition of dangers which existed for women and girls at that point in time.  ;Karen, yes, it&apos;s an interesting notion, to be sure. As you say, Germany struggled with (and I think in some respects still struggles with) the concept of national identity - funnily enough, if you speak to modern day Germans about this, a lot of them will tell you their national identity is at least partly board games. A quick diversion to explain why this is so, and why it&apos;s a legacy Germans rightly rally around - after WWII, Germany banned any games pertaining to war, for obvious reasons. While the US and other countries designed and refined games like Risk, German boardgame companies were forced to turn to non-combat topics, and quickly discovered that no one else was making *strategy* games. In addition to that, no one else was making games that could be enjoyed in equal measure by the whole family. (Monopoly is not a strategy game - the only strategy is &quot;buy everything you land on&quot; - and is not accessible to children who don&apos;t know how to read, for example.) Germany got *on* this problem, and created an entire *industry* of strategy games that can be played and enjoyed by anyone old enough not to eat the pieces, using the same rules for your 5 year old as your 95 year old grandmother. The games tend to be identifiable by having interesting choices to make on your turn, dynamic setup (so the board is different each time), little to no randomness, and themes ranging from farming to history to travel to building a coral reef. They&apos;re now called &quot;Eurogames&quot; or &quot;German games,&quot; because in Germany, boardgaming is a massively popular family activity. The largest boardgaming festival/release party is in Essen every year, and it&apos;s a worldwide, bring-your-family-and-play-games event. The biggest and most coveted award for a boardgame is to be named the Spiel de Jahres - Game of the Year in Germany. Even American-designed board games fight for that distinction, because if you land on the list, your game will sell out, in Germany and often across Europe (sometimes in America, too - that happened with Settlers of Catan, a German game, and Dominion, an American strategy card game, when they got the SdJ.) So, if you ask a German what it means to be German, many of them will say, &quot;we make excellent games!&quot; And they&apos;re right!As you point out, while the Germans struggled to find &quot;safe&quot; ways to celebrate being German, the Irish struggled to be recognized as Irish at all. I&apos;m positive that influenced the development (or stagnant nature) of their tales. How much is historical and how much is cultural, I think it&apos;s probably impossible to tease out. (I realize that&apos;s the point you were making, so I&apos;m not insinuating that you were making any kind of a declarative statement there.) I&apos;m inclined to think that culture provided the natural momentum in either direction, which was then aided by history... but without being able to travel back in time to the late 1700s/early 1800s, I doubt we&apos;ll ever know. There&apos;s only so much scholarly research can answer that question, I think, due to the passage of time, the near-annihilation of the Irish language, collapsing and reforming governments, An Gorta M _r, etc. Ironically, the historical *upheaval* in both countries is probably the biggest factor in our inability to definitively answer the question we&apos;re pondering!;Re: WWII and its effect on the UK vs. Germany - wow, I&apos;d never thought about it that way before, but I&apos;d bet you&apos;re right! I think the effects of WWII are sorely underestimated by Americans due to the way we&apos;re taught about it in school. It&apos;s very much presented as &quot;Hitler did some bad stuff, but how were we to know what he was really up to, it wasn&apos;t really our problem, but then the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and *then* the war started.&quot; Typical arrogant Yank stuff, I know! But I was usually the only one with my hand up going &quot;Er... the Brits were getting the living daylights bombed out of them. Roosevelt made his big &quot;you don&apos;t haggle over the price of your garden hose&quot; speech regarding the Lend-Lease Act in 1940*, so are we to infer from this that it was in fact Congress being a bunch of feckless thugs during the year that elapsed between that speech and us actually getting involved (that is, business as usual for that branch of government), or was FDR receiving political pressure from an outside source?&quot;That usually got me a &quot;see me after class.&quot;   What can I say... I&apos;m an American from the Irish diaspora, and the combination makes me disinclined to accept anything that smells like bull pucky. I am also probably still legend at my former uni for the only class in my life I ever walked out of, wherein a history professor announced a unit on &quot;The Famine,&quot; accepted my offer of a variety of source texts she had never seen (half and half, Irish and British, but all much better than the revisionist &quot;The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes&quot; crap in most American texts), and then, months later and having thanked me profusely for lending her said texts and allowing her to mark them up, promptly began the unit with &quot;The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes. Here, let&apos;s laugh at political cartoons depicting them as flea-ridden monkeys!&quot;Me: &quot;Er... are we going to discuss political satire in the 1840s and 50s and talk about where it came from and what the effects were on the various immigrant groups and persons of color it satirized? Possibly even tying that into the immigration debates of today?&quot;&quot;No, I just think they&apos;re funny.&quot; (In fairness, those weren&apos;t her exact words, but it was certainly the gist!)I can&apos;t even remember exactly what I said, but it was lengthy and remarkably clean considering how much red I was seeing.Anyway, yes, I&apos;m sure you&apos;re right about WWII being a huge causative factor in the sharp cultural division regarding the virtues of redemptive violence and the depiction of it in play. Makes perfect sense to me. And it makes me want to dig through all the modern retellings of fairy tales I know and see if I can spot the more recent evolutions!For myself, I&apos;d rather have a copy of Agricola than a model Spitfire, but then, no one can fault the British for their heroism in WWII, so I can see the appeal of model Spitfires, too. :)* You probably know this quotation well - most non-Americans I know have a far more comprehensive knowledge of WWII than Americans do - but for anyone interested, the full &quot;you don&apos;t haggle over the price of your garden hose&quot; Roosevelt quote I would refer to in these discussions, which concerned to what degree and in what form the US should help Britain during the war, goes like this: &quot;Suppose my neighbor&apos;s home catches fire, and I have a length of garden hose four or five hundred feet away. If he can take my garden hose and connect it up with his hydrant, I may help him to put out his fire. Now, what do I do? I don&apos;t say to him before that operation, &quot;Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it.&quot; What is the transaction that goes on? I don&apos;t want $15--I just want my garden hose back after the fire is over.&quot; - Franklin D. Roosevelt, Press Conference, December 17, 1940 (in the middle of the London Blitz, and almost a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor).;The glossing over of WWII was (and is) a systemic failure of the US public (free, government run) school system - not till I was taking uni-level US History in my last year before uni did I have a teacher who was *allowed* to contradict the texts. Most public school textbooks are printed by one of three companies in Texas, and they all spout the same inaccuracies, which the teacher is not allowed to contradict unless a student raises the point first. (Then it&apos;s &quot;class discussion,&quot; otherwise it&apos;s &quot;against the AKS,&quot; a manual that dictates what students will learn each year, and thus what teachers must teach, and how they&apos;re allowed to teach it) Fortunately I had a mother who was a history buff and a little bit of private school under my belt, so I was usually the one going &quot;Sir, wait a minute, what about...?&quot; Private schools tend to use a much broader range of source texts, so there&apos;s a little less indoctrination going on - apart from &quot;Bible based&quot; private schools, which is where all the creationism madness and the like comes from.The &quot;Irish people are flearidden monkeys&quot; thing was an incident at a fairly prestigious private university in the Southeastern US in 1998, and the kicker - the professor in question was &quot;proudly Irish&quot; (by which she meant Irish-American) and kept going on about how much she and I had in common (I&apos;m also Irish-American of course, but I still have relations and friends there, and was raised more in the ex-pat community than any other, so *my* idea of what it means to be Irish-American and *her* idea of what it meant to be Irish-American were two very different animals! Don&apos;t get me started on the horrors of St. Patrick&apos;s Day in this heathen country...).But yes, it&apos;s all true.Re: &quot;What people believe about the past is more important than what did happen&quot; - sadly, I&apos;ve heard people say similar things here, including some teachers... it drives all the good teachers I&apos;ve had crazy. I think it&apos;s a bastardization of the old &quot;the victors write the history books&quot; chestnut, but *I* was always told that by family and good teachers as a *warning*, i.e. don&apos;t just read the victor&apos;s side.&quot;Changing people&apos;s beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell.&quot; - oh yes. I live in Georgia, I know *all* about that! :);Karen, sorry, I think I was the one who wasn&apos;t clear - the &quot;what people believe&quot; quotation is absolutely true, the problem comes in when that&apos;s the end of the discussion (as it often is in my area)! I didn&apos;t mean to imply that the fellow who made that observation was anything less than a good teacher. :) In conversations about identity, I often joke that I am a person without a country. Born in Michigan, moved to in Georgia at age 7 (talk about culture shock), but in both cases, raised amongst ex-pats from the Republic, the North, England and Scotland. (Not so much Wales, for some reason. Not sure why that is.) My childhood was very much filled with observations, stories, ideas, and conversations that wouldn&apos;t be at all out of place in any pub (including the football!) It even colored very American things; our Thanksgivings are spent explaining the concept to the ex-pats who&apos;ve never been through an American Thanksgiving, and answering the incredulous questions that result. (&quot;Wait... so you lot have a huge over the top meal to commemorate annihilating the natives?&quot;) I&apos;ve seen both Gerry Adams and David Trimble speak. Larry Kirwan is a family friend and was one of the first people to help me get to grips with Irish. Our pantry was always full of goods you can&apos;t get here.... marmite, branston pickle, Barry&apos;s tea, hobnobs. (My American friends thought our house was some sort of magical wonderland - &quot;what is salad cream, and why are you reading a newspaper in another language?&quot;) As to my schooling, the first year was spent at a segregated school for disabled students, which was its own culture. The next few years were spent at a private school my father called &quot;tree-hugging hippie school&quot; - it was one of the first schools to use what later came to be called Montessori. We had little deskwork and lots of discussion about current events and important historical figures (Ghandi, Dr. King, Mandela, world leaders, etc. Alan Trammel (baseball player) was our &quot;Person of the Week&quot; one week, but only because the Detroit Tigers had done really well for a change!)Schools then desegregated for disabled students, and we combined our move to Georgia with my entrance into public school. That was when I realized that everything I knew was either &quot;wrong&quot; (by the metrics of American schools) or at least, &quot;different.&quot; All of a sudden I was going to school with students who had no knowledge of other cultures and teachers who didn&apos;t know what to do with me on any level - I&apos;d been doing work at a 16 year old level at my private school, so I was terribly bored being plunked back in with 8 year olds, but I needed supports the public school system wasn&apos;t used to providing (I can&apos;t physically write by hand), and I was constantly trying to delve into topics at the depth I&apos;d experienced at private school, which made me few friends and many enemies. I spent the next four years trying to learn how to &quot;be American,&quot; when all that time I&apos;d thought I was already!I entered high school at 12 (instead of the more normal 14-15) and finally found a rhythm and a sense of belonging in my small town southern school, which had fantastic teachers who saw something in me and pushed me harder than I&apos;d ever been pushed in my life. (My mother still likes to relate the tale wherein I came home from school crying because I had a C in English for the interim grading period - a C! I thought the world was going to end. Mom asked if she needed to call the teacher. My reply: &quot;No... Two of us got a C, the rest of us failed.&quot; At that point, mom was *definitely* going to call the teacher. Me: &quot;No... she said this is a gifted level class and we&apos;re not doing gifted level work.&quot; Mom: &quot;Is that true?&quot; Me: &quot;I guess so... but this is *hard*!&quot; Mom called the teacher... to thank her. :) ) It scares the hell out of me that if I&apos;d been born about 5 years earlier and had had different parents, I might not be able to type this sentence. Segregated schools in the 70s and 80s US were more like &quot;holding pens&quot; or &quot;respite care&quot; for disabled pupils - very little learning went on (that wasn&apos;t the fault of the teachers, but rather the system, which dumped all of the disabled pupils of a similar age into the same classroom, regardless of their abilities or limitations). Anyway, it all results in me having little idea how to answer the identity question. &quot;Irish-American&quot; works in casual conversation, but the term is so diluted these days that it doesn&apos;t really convey how proud I am of my heritage, and how immersed I&apos;ve been in its culture. At the same time, I have no right to claim more than that (and I would never dare!). &quot;Disabled&quot; is certainly a culture, and one I &quot;speak&quot; fluently (I can carry on a conversation in ASL, &quot;see&quot; for a blind person, help someone navigate obtaining a service dog, advise someone on how to figure out a way for them to do laundry or cook a meal, and repair pretty much any wheelchair on the market, as well as playing several wheelchair sports most of my life), but the non-disabled world doesn&apos;t recognize it as such - to them, disability is a terrible thing that we should work to erradicate. &quot;American&quot; is certainly true too - despite myself, I do love this country in many ways, particularly the optimism of its political system as written. The founding fathers, the Kennedys, and FDR are nothing short of heroes to me. On the other hand, many aspects of this country drive me crazy, and the connotations of &quot;American&quot; to the rest of the world (and certain subsets of Americans) are not something with which I like being associated. Despite living in the South for 24 years, &quot;Southern&quot; definitely doesn&apos;t apply. &quot;Midwestern&quot; fits much better (and most Americans peg me as such right away) - but then I have to explain how and why I haven&apos;t lived there since I was very young, and that I only visit once a year. &quot;German-American&quot; certainly fits - my father&apos;s side of the family has a decidedly Teutonic bearing, and I&apos;ve had people pick that out in me too - but then I have to explain why I speak Irish, not German, and why everything else about me is so distinctly *Irish* (to the point where Irish-born people have asked me what county I&apos;m from and told me my American accent is *brilliant*!) I envy the Americans I know who can proudly say with no equivocation that they&apos;re American, full stop. I have always felt like an outsider looking in to this country, but I&apos;ve never known exactly where I&apos;m looking in from.;Not to mention Li&apos;l Stan Lee:;Pre-Freud, pre-secularism, pre-mass media... I like to think they&apos;d be intrigued, though some of our ideas would be just plain baffling, rooted as they are in almost 200 years of cultural difference! But I reckon they&apos;d be up for it. They wanted to preserve the Tales as they heard them, but they were devoted to the project of understanding them. I reckon the Grimms would be pleased as punch that we&apos;re still puzzling over it all :);I&apos;m confused because I can&apos;t find space for the title. Unless the title&apos;s counted as part of the word count?  ;Thinking of The Company of Wolves turned my thoughts on to Tanith Lee&apos;s fantasies.  Red as Blood, or Tales from the Sisters Grimmer  had that genuinely weird, archaic feel to them that she also used in  Tales From The Flat Earth.  Her White As Snow  felt old, old, old with its Kore-Demeter themes and its terrifyingly warped trees and folk magic.My Grandma wouldn&apos;t have told tales like the Grimm tales - they&apos;d have been a bit too demented for her. The sanitised versions are what she told us. The scarier, darker versions are what kids tend to seek out for themselves.;Urban fantasy often deals very much with fairy tales: Characters from the Grimm collection, from mythology from all over the world, magical and religious traditions pop up in modern settings.Charles de Lint&apos;s written lots of urban fantasy novels set in a fictional town, Newtown, near a Native reservation in Canada. Some of the inhabitants find their ways to the Otherworld through odd, liminal places (a tree in a park, abandoned buildings, etc.), encountering their ancestral spirits and the gods, spirits and magic their forebears brought with them to Canada from Europe. And the Native spirits are a constant presence, communicating with those tribal members who uphold traditional views and practices. When I read Gaiman&apos;s American Gods, which I adore, I did wonder if he&apos;d been reading de Lint.There&apos;s a whole chunk of fantasy literature in this vein, in which modern people are forced to accept the reality of fairies and other supernatural beings, having to visit the fairies&apos; home territory (often described as bewildering, dangerous and frightening) as well as having to repair or mitigate the effects the Otherworld is having on ours.  Raymond E Feist&apos;s Faerie Tale is set almost entirely within a fairy mound as a father searches for his abducted child. Laurell K Hamilton has written a whole series about a fairy princess desperate to escape the ongoing war between the Seelie and Unseelie courts. It&apos;s becoming very popular to examine fairy traditions this way, especially by female authors.;My intro to his books was Onion Girl, and my husband&apos;s was Trader. The books all tend to work as stand-alones, though as you read more of them you can see how they interlock. It makes them accessible while also ensuring that each acts as background to others.;Well, the NSA is scooping up all your online activity, so probably.;You want my real name? YOU CAN&apos;T HANDLE MY REAL NAME!!I don&apos;t know what came over me...;You know nothing, Jon Snow!;Have you seen that massive list of key words and phrases they use to flag up potential trouble? It&apos;s so enormous it must surely render itself useless.  ;It&apos;s been years since I read a version of Baba Yaga, but doesn&apos;t the dawn, noon, and night explanation feature there? I seem to recall that Baba Yaga asks Vaselisa (?) to answer the riddle of the white, red and black horsemen.;Good old Robert Graves - where would 20th century Neopaganism have been without him? :);I don&apos;t remember not reading. I could certainly read before I got to school. Reading was just something everyone in the family did. We had practically no cash, but there were enough cousins and neighbours to keep books flowing like the melange in Dune.  As a kid, I&apos;d read anything. Books, comics, the labels on tins at the shop...  ;We seem to have a lot in common :)Comics had to come out of pocket money or be passed along from someone else, so they were more occasional treats than anything else. Dad had read The Eagle when he was a kid, and The Beano and The Dandy were classic parts of a working class British childhood. Though I think they&apos;d both have been horrified if they&apos;d realised that 2000AD  and Misty contained such... &quot;mature themes&quot;. I think they saw comics as normal, benign kid-lit, so I got away with it without being checked.It was the books that worried them. Having been absolutely petrified by Poe at 7 years old, I was under strict instructions about not reading books that were too grown-up and scary, and they did linger around while I was scouring the library, and had an understanding with the librarians that anything &quot;too much&quot; for me would be gently discouraged.  ;Oh, good grief, Megan - I think our Dads were clones.Kathleen - it IS a good question. My sister loves reading, but she never read as avidly or omnivorously as me. She was way better at art than me, and was very much a visual learner. I&apos;ve slowed down because ME (CFS) causes varying degrees of &quot;brain fog&quot; that can make reading harder. I suppose that, like Megan, growing up in a family where word games are the norm, from competitive punning to Scrabble to Boggle, helps. As a late primary school child, I was very much bullied, and I was always what my Mum called &quot;a self-sufficient, solitary soul&quot;. Given the choice between playing out and reading, reading usually won out. Socialising is really important to me, but my ideal adulthood was very much on the lines of spending my life reading... well, everything. Maybe being a bookworm&apos;s innate.  ;It is the weirdest thing, isn&apos;t it, how literature classes at school tend to suck the life and pleasure right out of reading. I was already addicted enough to reading to find pleasure despite it.  How brilliant that you bucked the trend and became a reader as an adult!  ;There&apos;s something about the Harry Potter books, apparently! I read the first one, and never got round to the rest, though I enjoyed it tremendously. An old acquaintance has a daughter with serious learning difficulties who found reading incredibly frustrating. But when she was 11 years old, her parents gave the first Harry Potter book. They realised she&apos;d gone very quiet, and went and stood for ages at her bedroom door just watching the pleasure on her face as she read. It transformed her experience of reading forever.It sounds like your kids are doing really well. An A* is tough to get when you&apos;re working in your own language! Congratulations :);Oh, wow. Samantha was looking for audio books in this thread - we should definitely put a link there.;And some very cool art based on it:  http://www.themarysue.com/amelia-pond-alice-in-wonderland/;It is cringe-making and emotionally tiring. Mind you, it&apos;s all around us still. If you&apos;ve seen the Everyday Sexism project, for instance, or checked out feminist geek culture sites like Feminist Frequency  or The Mary Sue, Nine Worlds, or  Finding Ada, there&apos;s brilliant light shed on the ways in which women, queer and trans people, people with disabilities, and people of colour are treated in SF&amp;F art and culture.  I am nowhere near as aware of issues around disabilities and colour as I need to be. Yet. There is a cultural shift going on, with Den Of Geek, for example reporting on this year&apos;s Cripping The Con.I read a lot of vintage and Victorian literature, and it&apos;s fascinating to see how attitudes have shifted. It&apos;s also uncomfortable to see how much in play those attitudes still are in wider culture today, though damped down. We&apos;ve learned that being overtly bigoted is socially unacceptable. The problem is that we&apos;ve tended to assume that it&apos;s only the overt displays that are problematic. It is hard to find the more subtle underlying assumptions in ourselves and others and deal with it.And you&apos;re right. There&apos;s a point at which dealing with in-your-face bigotry makes you want to throw things. Saeed&apos;s made a great point: we can de-fang it by dealing with it as a group. Mutual support makes all the difference.;There&apos;s a good essay about how being a member of multiple minority groups really throws the unexamined assumptions of the dominant group in your face here - a bi-racial (White and Native American), queer, trans, poly, working class geek on comic cons. The comments are also interesting.;This is really interesting. Thank you :)In early 19th century England, spinning, brewing, baking and dancing were masculine pursuits as well as feminine. I&apos;m from an old textiles town, and spinning and weaving were pretty much evenly spread across families and age groups in this area before the industrial revolution; when the machines came, spinning became almost entirely the province of women and children. Brewing was a woman&apos;s work up until the late middle-ages when the ale laws came in, pushing women out of owning alehouses and brewing for them. Baking was a communal activity here outside of big houses, with communal ovens dotted about, usually run by men. And dancing was an important social skill for everyone.Was it the same in Germany?I love how many areas for exploration you&apos;ve opened up in one tale!The tradition of Lilith having known God&apos;s name is something I didn&apos;t know at all. That is fascinating.;Frustrating, isn&apos;t it, that there were so many socially engaged and well-respected women involved in all areas of intellectual endeavour, and yet they&apos;re airbrushed from history.;There is a tendency to assume that criticising a book/graphic novel/film/tv series/game for this sort of thing means you can&apos;t enjoy it, or that if you enjoy it you can&apos;t criticise it. As Anita Sarkeesian put it, it&apos;s vital to enjoy and criticise in order to make what you love even better.;I think it&apos;s true that you can portray a fully inclusive and nonviolent society in an exciting way. Conflict isn&apos;t necessarily about violence. Conflict will always occur because people vary so much. We tend to think of peace and inclusivity as a passive, static state when they&apos;re really processes, ways of being in the world that foster creativity and adventure. There may be more innovation than in an egalitarian world in which nonviolence and co-operation mean that education and the confidence to experiment are the norm.  But the physical fight is ingrained as short-hand for &quot;standing up for yourself&quot; in our world. Want to show how a woman is empowered? Give her a gun and make her &quot;kick-ass&quot; (generally while she&apos;s wearing high heels and something skin-tight). Want to show a slave asserting their own power? Have them kill their master. Want to demonstrate a revolution? Make it violent.It&apos;s so ingrained that it takes a lot more creativity and hard work to come up a nonviolent reaction to violence, and to even imagine that a story that doesn&apos;t include violence can be thrilling, absorbing or meaningfully deal with some form of conflict. Some of the best SF&amp;F manages it by doing it on a small scale (Bradbury does this repeatedly), and though there&apos;s something of an Anglophone fascination with Quakers (for some reason, we pop up quite a bit in sci-fi), there&apos;s a tendency to go down the easy, well-trodden route of the hero as The Just Warrior, whose violence is done in the name of good, and is therefore morally justifiable, so we can all just chuck our qualms out of the window and stop worrying about it.I have a tremendous love for blockbuster sci-fi films and tv series (how excited am I about the new Agents of SHIELD series?? And the love of Wolverine is almost lifelong), and yet I&apos;d still like to see them do better in the creative approaches to solving terrible problems stakes.  ;Nathan - I didn&apos;t articulate that well. I wasn&apos;t saying you meant that conflict necessarily must mean violence (physical or otherwise); I was saying that this is how it&apos;s played out in most areas of fiction today, and that sci-fi and fantasy are often guilty of dealing with controversy and conflict through violence.  Of course we need to read things that are controversial, and deal with issues that make us uncomfortable, things that potentially disrupt our prejudices. We need to be stretched. Seeing structural violence as well as physical violence embedded in stories as the natural order, or what is morally right, time after time after time, though, can be wearing. And that&apos;s a problem for fantasy (in which so often the solution is a bunch of fairly privileged folk fighting for the return of The Rightful King to rule over his happily top-down hierarchy) and sci-fi (in which so often the solution is for the hero to take up violence/learn to temper his violence with mercy so as to be a Just Warrior).;Yes.So often, the people pushing for this are not the people who have suffered because of those attitudes, and aren&apos;t actually comfy enough with the people who have to ask their opinions and shed some prejudices. I do wonder how many of those adults who object are just trying to dodge hard questions from their kids.  ;In my experience, there&apos;s plenty of ground between &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me&quot; and &quot;It bothers me so I want to censor it&quot;. It&apos;s not an either/or proposition. The ground between those reactions is the fertile area for discussion and growth.;I wish I could upvote this a gazillion times.Yes. What someone who isn&apos;t negatively affected by an issue blithely assumes someone who is is &quot;overreacting&quot; because it&apos;s &quot;j</string>
            <string>Ah, let me let you in on a secret.   A thesis is an &quot;idea&quot; however fanciful.   And as soon as you find just one thing that proves your thesis wrong then it is not &quot;va;lid&quot;.   But that doesn&apos;t mean that the thought wasn&apos;t worth it, and there will always be someone out there who needs to hear the message why that thesis is wrong.   If being right is important, then academia is a &quot;nay-sayer&quot; and humility will quickly become your friend.   So suck it up and let yourself go!   You never know who you are  talking to!!;Basically, is it a good idea to look for additional information on the writers, period and place of writing to gain further understanding of what the piece is about? A more provocative question: is looking up available critic materials about it considered widening one&apos;s horizons or cheating?;Same here! I&apos;ve been a huge admirer of King&apos;s work since It scared the bejeesus out of me when I was twelve, but still haven&apos;t gotten around to the Dark Tower series. It&apos;s definitely on my to-read list.;</string>
            <string>fourthed. lol. ;</string>
            <string>I think that is necessary to get to know  the psychological and sociological factors  that influenced the  author&apos;s writing, since those are the predispositions that led to the novel itself. e.g. In the introductory video lectures Freud is mentioned. One might say that in his writings the mentality of the Victorian era is imprinted, and that is the reason why such emphasis is given on the human sexuality...;</string>
            <string>But, I will imply that other &quot;supplementary&quot; texts that give a critique or other explanations on the novels are counterproductive for the purposes of this course.;I would think that the more research you do, the deeper you will be able to understand the texts. ;Great tool,   will try it in my computer this night;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t think most of us would consider supplementary reading as &apos;cheating&apos; -- the whole point here   is for us to get as much as we can out of the course topic;</string>
            <string>In my opinion, one of the many aims of this course is to learn to read attentively and to notice  some interesting details and associations. To do this, some students just need to know more about the author and  their works, to know both historic and social background of  theirs and thus find out what  they could be possibly reflecting in their book. I wouldn&apos;t say it is harmful to look up these details prior to/in the process of  reading. But of course, only to enrich our conclusions not to replaces them. :);</string>

            <string>I agree. And even at the end of the book Victor still felt justified in destroying the creature, where in contrast the creature felt remorse for destroying Victor and expiated his crimes by committing suicide. That ending makes the creature look much more heroic than Victor.;I agree with Anna, I also prefer to have at least some sympathy for the main character and some point of relationship or understanding of their world view. Victor seemed so self-centered, egotistical, and vain that it definitely made the creature more sympathetic in my view. Victor basically abandoned what amounted to a newborn and totally abdicated any responsibility to guide the creature&apos;s development just because it was ugly on the outside. And Victor whined through the whole book (OK, modern sensibility but he never took ANY responsibility for his actions or tried to make amends.) In my view, Victor was the real monster--which may have been Mary Shelley&apos;s point.;</string>

            <string>When I do an in-text citation using something I&apos;ve read on my Kindle I put the Kindle location instead of a page number and a note in the Works Cited section to explain that is the system I&apos;m using. So far I haven&apos;t gotten marked off (or told off) for doing that. ;I think you have to be aware that for some of the writers English is not their first language. They seem to be taking the course as a way of improving their writing skills. Writing an understandable essay is an achievement for them, so I&apos;m not as concerned that they have a fully developed thesis. You don&apos;t want to discourage these folks from reading and writing for this course by being too nit-picky. I may be &quot;grading on a curve&quot; but I tend to give more leeway to the ESL students. I think some people can go a bit overboard on questioning sentence order and saying there are grammar errors without giving any examples. That&apos;s not helpful. I try to look more for insight and an essay that enriches my experience. Form is important, but not as much as content, in my opinion.;</string>
            <string>I would probably not quote any source in the essay, as the analysis is suppossed to be mainly textual, but if it helps you understand better, why not? I can agree with the idea of doing this after you&apos;ve read the book, to avoid spoilers and even pre-judgements on your personal reading, but I would never discourage it entirely. How could more information (providing it&apos;s the correct information) be damaging?;</string>
            <string>Fairy tales still exist. They are still are both written and filmed and we read and watch them. We just associate fairy tales with gradmas reading from big dusty books and &quot;once upon a time&quot; formulas. Fairy tales are still here and are still a very popular genre, they only have changed the form. :);That is an interesting perspective, Jae and Abigail. But I absolutely agree with Selena. In my opinion, the story centers around the maiden. The rabbit is an intruder, someone who comes to the garden, takes what he wants and rudely asks for more - he wants the maiden to &quot;sit on his tail&quot; and go with him. That is a hint of sexuality. In the 18th century, sex was strictly considered a matter of marriage. Therefore, when the maiden is seduced, she automatically must be married to the rabbit, who turns out to be not a very good husband at all. BTW, which maiden would ever wish to marry a rabbit instead of a man? In silly words, the very rabbitness of the maiden&apos;s seducer  is meant to symbolize an undesirable trait in  a husband.  That is how the poor maiden was punished for disobeying her mother&apos;s advice. I have to say I disagree with the opinion that there was a problem of communication between mother and her daughter. 18th century mothers (or grandmas) who told this story would not wish to give such a message to their children. Fairy tale mothers almost  always personify morality and protection.;Hello Anahita, That is an interesting point! I have been thinking about this, too. You have mentioned Cinderella or Aschenputtel in German or Cendrillon in French or   in my maternal language  - Slovak -  Popolu  ka :) This story is incredibly spread throughout the whole world. I even read that Cinderella is originally a Chinese fairy tale, which I don&apos;t know if it is true... but who knows? And this is not just Cinderella. Lots of the same fairy tales are commonly told in different parts of the world, perhaps with  subtle nuances.  I think they may have developed independently because people went through pretty similar situations in their everyday life. Whether the  fairy tale  was meant to be a warning story with didactic purpose or a story that personified ideals and values they believed in (therefore it was pleasant to listen to), some similar motives  may have develop independently and later influenced each other. And as a result, we know the same or very similar fairy tales all over the world.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m sure I would have a completely different understanding of Stoker&apos;s Dracula, if I hadn&apos;t checked the historical and social background. I think it is necessary to know when and where a certain book was written and some details about the authors biography. However, I wouldn&apos;t go further than that. I think any kind of critic ruins the fun of reading. Moreover, in my opinion, there is no such a thing as misinterpreting literature. Every interpretation is subjective and can be correct.  ;Criei esse t _pico para que n _s, brasileiros possamos discutir sobre o conte  do dado no curso._________________________For the non brazillians:I&apos;ve created this thread for us brazillian people talk about the course content.;I&apos;m only part way through, but my favorite so far has been Clever Grethel. It illustrates the fantasy of getting away with doing wrong, which everyone tries to do at one point. I only wish some of the stories I came up with as a child worked so well! She also isn&apos;t a perfect princess. She&apos;s a little edgy with her &quot;red shoes&quot; and pouring herself a &quot;famous drink.&quot;  ;I haven&apos;t looked at the edition we will be reading for this class, but I recently finished a course on fairytales at my University. My favorite Grimm stories that we read for that class were stories that I wasn&apos;t even aware of as a child, perhaps because they were so new for me. The True Bride and the Maiden Without Hands are two that stand out, hopefully they are included in the Lucy Crane edition!;I am confused and concerned about the grading process of the essay assignments. In the only other Coursera course I have taken, the students were given credit for the peer assessments they did, but the grades were not counted toward any official grade for the course. The peer assessments were used for feedback only, and often valuable, but in many cases, not so much. I tried to read about the peer assessments in this course, but it is rather confusing. Are the grades given by peers counted as part of our overall, official grade, or are we just given credit for doing them? If the former is the process for this course, I will not participate in the essays. As an educator myself who uses peer evaluations in my own classes, I would never allow the grades given by other students to be the official grade or part of the official grade at the end of a class. The answer to this question will determine whether or not I participate fully in this course, so a timely answer would be greatly appreciated!;Lol, this thread made me laugh.   Y&apos;all are reading into things far too deeply.   Just read the books, get your peer essays and give your honest views.   You are going to get a &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; on the basis of doing your work.   Anything more than that is a bonus!   But more&apos;s the point - why are you doing this course if it is not to expand your mind?   ;It&apos;s a better and more remarkable story if he gets paid in gold--and it really stands out in the collection because there are no talking animals, magical witches, prophetic princesses, or mountains of glass involved.

Between that and Disney, I associate so many of these stories with songs!;You know, during the Depression, there was the Federal Writers&apos; Project--the government sent writers out to gather oral histories, which included ghost stories and other legends, so they wouldn&apos;t be lost.   ;Ok, when I read that story, I too instantly thought of Bugs in drag, singing out &quot;Oh, Nappy! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &quot;We may have been separated at birth, Fishbone....perhaps you were stolen from our dear mother&apos;s bosom, carried off by a rabid raven and raised by ravenous rabbits.... (do birds get rabies?   I was going for alliteration)  ;Uhhhh.....wabbits awe unusuawwy warge cweatures,.....Okay, would Bugs Bunny cartoons fall in this genre?   I&apos;m confused at why comic books weren&apos;t.....;Six Soldiers makes me think of the Five Chinese Brothers;I think these were probably chosen because they are the fathers of the genre.   Although I think Swift and   Verne should have been included, since his &quot;worlds&quot; pre-date Wells and Carroll.   But most everything we consider sci-fi and fantasy came from these....I think.  I&apos;m here to learn!;Clive Barker&apos;s Weaveworld.   Orwell&apos;s 1984.   And if the detective stories are in this genre, then I would have to say anything by James M Cain and Dashiell Hammett.   And Erle Stanley Gardner, because he tried to be cutting edge as far as forensics went.  ;Definitely Dark Tower series--also The Talisman and The Eyes of the Dragon.;I was just thinking about how differently the fairy tales would be if they were written today (&quot;...Rapunzel leapt from the vehicle, screaming, &apos;You&apos;re not the boss of me, I&apos;ll call you a witch if I want to!&apos; and slammed the car door.   Unfortunately, as the car drove off, she realized she had shut about four feet of her hair in the car door....&quot;)Then I realized....the women actually have the best stories.   The men who star in the stories tend to be, well, idiots :)      The women get to be heroines and femme fatales and greedy villainesses....great soap star roles.;That&apos;s a good question....take Hansel &amp; Gretel....there&apos;s no real supernatural forces at work there, nothing too off the wall....the witch could just be an awful old woman....the house of gingerbread doesn&apos;t even necessarily have to be the one that she actually lived in, it could have just been sitting on the window ledge, like a cooling pie.......so then you just have a story of a couple of abandoned kids, kept against their will.   Kind of like Flowers in the Attic.  ;That&apos;s a good explanation, Megan.   After we&apos;ve done one or two, and have the experience of reading other papers, we&apos;ll be old pros at this.I wonder--not from the question brought up here--but from some of the other threads--if some people think this is like a book report, summarizing what they&apos;ve read.....I have a question--since I&apos;ve never done the Coursera before....I don&apos;t see a way to privately communicate with anyone--is there?   Also, I saw the link someone posted for the study room site--so I wondered how people knew when to meet there also....;Even a collection tells you about the collector.   ;Speaking of Disney....they have embellished on the stories of Pocahontas and Anastasia, making them barely recognizable from the historic figures they&apos;re based upon.   I&apos;m sure the same can be said of some of the fairy tales--no doubt some were based on real events.;When I mentioned Disney, I was thinking about how Disney puts its own spin on the stories, changing them so much, and Disney&apos;s version will probably be the version that &quot;wins&quot;.;Three is just a great number lol.In comedy, 3 is used all the time.   Do you know the one about the mouse, the bird, and the sausage?   The third thing is supposed to be a funny surprise.;The beginning, the middle, the end.   The good, the bad, the ugly.   Larry, Curly, and Moe.   It has a rhythm.   But you know what?   Other numbers show up too.   Loners, pairs, family of four, seven dwarves, etc.   I think we notice 3 so much more because we associate fairytales with thetitles--the 3 little pigs and the 3 bears and 3 billy goats gruff, etc.;When choreographing a dance number, the magic number tends to be 4.   You show the audience a step--that&apos;s 1--but it was sort of a surprise, they almost missed it..   So you repeat it--2--for them to see.   3rd time--they now expect it, and the 4th time--they appreciate your skill.   I just know 3 is classic comedy material.   A priest, a rabbi, and a hilarious punchline walk into a bar.....3 never fails to get a laugh.   ;Yeah, it&apos;s just one of those things about people that makes us unique.   I don&apos;t think animals care about number sequences or patterns.   If you notice in some stories though, they do go that fourth time.   And it feels off.   ;I kind of just stand by three &quot;sounds good&quot;.    Think of a 3-legged stool.   Two legs and it would just fall over.   I don&apos;t think, for the most part, that 3 has that much significance.   It just sounds good, or it gives the right effect.Now....the 3 drops of blood.....that is like ingredients in a recipe or for an incantation.   In that case, 3 is a magic number.   Also, if one could see into the future and know that they would be needed three times, then 3 would be the proper number.   And since this thread was started, I&apos;ve been thinking of that old Multiplication Rocks song.....Three is a magic number  Ya it is, it&apos;s a magic number  Somewhere in that ancient mystic trinity  You&apos;ll get three  As a magic number  The past, the present, the future,  Faith, and hope, and charity,  The heart, the brain, the body,  Will give you three,  It&apos;s a magic number  It takes three legs to make a tripod or to make a table stand,  And it takes three wheels to make a vehicle called a tricycle  And every triangle has three corners,  Every triangle has three sides,  No more, no less,  You don&apos;t have to guess  That it&apos;s three  Can&apos;t you see?  It&apos;s a magic number  A man and a woman had a little baby  Yeah they did  And there were three in the family  And that&apos;s a magic number  3, 6, 9,  12, 15, 18,  21, 24, 27,  30   etc.;I think the lesson is.....it&apos;s Hans&apos; business, not ours.   Would you want him sticking his nose in your trades (particularly since you can see what a knack he has for them)?   After 7 years, he&apos;s quit his job, changing his life.   If he makes decisions that we don&apos;t agree with, they are his decisions, and at least he&apos;s doing something.  ;There ya go.   I&apos;m just glad I don&apos;t get paid in gold as big as my head.   No one at Walmart would know how to make change.;I think it&apos;s weird to be reading these traditional stories on a computer anyway.   I think I have downloaded 3 different versions of everything lol.   I have 3 different ebook apps on my laptop, and then i download them to my phone as well.   I find it pretty easy to squeeze in some reading on my phone when I&apos;m in waiting rooms, long cashier lines, etc.   I decided to take the course just to see if I could get through it lol.   Make the time to do the reading and the assignments, be able to master all the stuff that an online course requires. ( I got my acceptance letter for Old Dominion University today! )As far as skipping it, you aren&apos;t required to do all of them to pass.   But if anyone wants to skip the first one, I would submit a paper ANYWAY, just so you would know what is required to submit it.   ;I read a story about a fishwife when I was in first grade--and I instantly nicknamed my sister &quot;fishwife&quot;.   My mother would yell at me about it.   Then when my sister was about 20, I heard my mom call her &quot;fishwife&quot;.   My take on these stories is more about the character of the fisherman&apos;s wife.   She never seems to change.   She is always bossy, and can&apos;t be pleased.   I think that these stories were told to amuse people because we all know someone like that.   They may have been told in the hopes that these people would change, but in my opinion, they never do.   (Sorry, Sis.);I think I want to be pope now.;Ehhhh, we just know we deserve the best.   Gives you men something to shoot for.   ;An interesting thread.   Just wanted to throw my two cents in....People learn what they&apos;ve been taught, and &apos;BACK THEN&quot; people were not exposed to a lot.   I&apos;m going to throw this out there, and I may get some people disagreeing....BUT I think that none of us has been exposed to much until the past, oh, 20 years.   Between 24 hour news, and the internet, we are beginning to get a glimpse of the world.   Think about how many new ideas you have probably been exposed to....(and I&apos;m sorry, if you can&apos;t at least point to &quot;2 girls, one cup&quot;, or some other bizarre video, then you aren&apos;t being honest with yourself!)......The only way the world is going to change is with time, information, and education.   It&apos;s easy to disregard things you don&apos;t know about or understand.   These stories--they are information for you to use--to know that there are people who have these views, it&apos;s something to think about, how can we help people to feel differently about these things?....;lol I feel nervous about mine.   I kept it simple--in case it&apos;s reviewed by someone whose English skills aren&apos;t that great.   It&apos;s too bad that early submitters can&apos;t go ahead with the whole process.   ;I&apos;m really looking forward to getting &quot;graded&quot; lol......and I can&apos;t WAIT to read and evaluate these other papers....MWAHAHAHAHAHA!     I&apos;m glad we&apos;ve had the forums, though....gives you an opportunity to see kind of what ideas other people have, etc.;I know bartering was popular (and still is--lol you know you&apos;re supposed to report it on your taxes!) but trades like those always make me think of shows like Leave It to Beaver, where the kids get ripped off by their friends lol;Ha!   lol I didn&apos;t know what to name this thread, but I thought we could post any videos, other info, that we might find helpful...or at least a pleasant distraction!Last night I found THE 10TH KINGDOM on Netflix.   If you&apos;ve never seen it, it&apos;s sort of about the &quot;current&quot; goings on in fairy tale land....might make it more fun for you people who aren&apos;t digging Grimms!  Also the Prophets of Science Fiction series is on Netflix.   The Prophets series is also on YouTube :)   Here&apos;s the first episode, on Mary Shelley  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvQaZXT1jkk;lol oh come on, it gives you something to listen to when you&apos;re cooking dinner or something.   Besides, the class will be over at SOME point, so you could watch them then.That Prophets of Science Fiction series has an episode on H.G. Wells, too, as well as other Sci Fi writers that aren&apos;t included in our course.   And here&apos;s Biography channel&apos;s H. G. Wells  http://www.biography.com/people/hg-wells-39224/videos;Just imagine you&apos;re talking to ME (And I am smiling brightly, very excited to hear what YOU have to say)......just tell me about the FASCINATING thesis you&apos;ve come up with--why and how you came about what you discovered--and then your final thoughts, as Jerry Springer called them.   lol the scary thing is the word count. My first draft was exactly what I wanted to say, and was only 199 words!!!;</string>
            <string>In view of the fact that the stories are from Alice&apos;s viewpoint and contain all the silly little girl gibberish a little girl might come up with, it seems like it would be a natural for someone to get to really know a child to be able to write like that.   Boys and men often comment about the mysteries of the female--what they think (Ha!   the fact that we DO think--how many times have you asked a woman what she&apos;s thinking about and she answers &quot;NOTHING&quot;?????   Never!), their delightfully strange and beautiful undergarments, all the little hair and makeup secrets they have, etc.   Carroll probably found it fascinating that he was accepted in the little girls&apos; world (much like being accepted as one of the gorillas lol).   And when someone can tell such great stories--children flock to entertainers.   When I was a precocious child of six, a family friend often commented that he was going to marry me when I grew up--in front of the women he dated!   By the time I was twelve, as he was still single, my parents began to wonder if he was truly waiting for me.   ;Fishbone, stop flirting with me.;I&apos;ve downloaded several different versions, have a few different readers on my computer.   Seems like some are better than others. I love using my phone while I&apos;m waiting in the car or standing in line.   Not hard to squeeze some reading in like that.   As for the NEVER READING ABOUT VAMPIRES---oh, poor, poor vampires!   To be immortal would be so tragic......to have to be able to look back and remember that you wore all the horrible fad clothes.....Have you ever seen NOSFERATU???   or better yet, Nicolas Cage in The Vampire&apos;s Kiss?!!!  ;</string>
            <string>I agree. You should be able to get something out of literature on your own. You can read what a critic or an expert say later.;Hey, everyoneI was just curious about what were people&apos;s favorite things. Well, not so much things as &apos;Books and authors&apos; -- though other favorites can certainly be included!My favorite authors are PC Hodgell and Michelle Sagara West.My favorite book outside of theirs is Pamela Dean&apos;s Tam Lin - which often encourages me to go back to school in hopes of finding the Wild Hunt.Carrie;Thanks!   I was able to get the pdf and then the link worked to put it on my Kindle.     Happy reading!;It&apos;s a bit annoying for someone like myself who only found and joined the class yesterday. It is the reading issue that is making me worry about actually completing the course...;I agree, it would be very helpful if specific readings were given well in advance so people could get a head start especially given that there seems to be a lot of reading with not much time. Given that the advice on the video link is to read slowly that hardly seems possible if there is a lot of reading.;Wow, did not know that - must try that sometime! Thank you so much for the tip, Byurakn!;Those tales do  not only reflect the society and the time during which they were written, but they also had a huge impact on people&apos;s life.  I imagine how this way of looking at  life  highly encouraged marrying  your very first love... Or more dramatic... Made girls easily accept to marry the first man who asked for  their hand.Stories are very powerful vectors of ideas. They can highly influence a whole generation. They can be used in many different ways. I tend to comment the stories I read to my kids and ask them questions to help them think critically about the story. I prefer stories which will empower my children.Traditional tales  including princesses and dragons  are highly interesting and part of our culture... But... &quot;How to train a dragon&quot; reflects today&apos;s ideals. I read so so so many times all my fairy books when I was a kid, and I had plenty of very traditional ones in original versions... They had a huge influence on me. Maybe not always a good one, because I did not live in the same world anymore... And, being able to think about them critically came later I believe. But I have to say that they did nourish my imagination from a very young age. Little Red Cap from the Grimm was inspired from  Little Red Ridding Hood  first written by Charles Perrault. But, Charles Perrault did not invent that story which  used to be told in families the evening near the fire. It evolved sort of in a darwinian way... slowly from old myths... Most stories tell how to survive in the world...  (Don&apos;t follow strangers...) Stories can save.  Stories can cure, Stories can do so many things, really...    When you tell a story... Be aware of its power... Make good use of it...;I didn&apos;t read the Six Soldiers of Fortune as a model of teamwork, more of how the soldiers were greedy and deceitful. I&apos;m going to have to go back and read this one again to see if I can find the optimism in the character&apos;s actions. :-) Thanks!;I think the reason the story doesn&apos;t portray the soldiers as greedy is hidden in the beginning of the story: these soldiers fought for a king, but the king did not reward them afterwards as he should have.For a contemporary parallel in the US, see the current backlog of VA claims for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.   You could imagine retelling the story with a brigade of veterans storming Washington and carrying off medical supplies or something.;This is an ongoing problem for me as I teach successive on-line courses, i.e., forgetting where all the dates are and resetting them for the next class.   I&apos;m sure the staff that monitor the forums will get the dates updated soon (and only wish I had administrative assistants who would do the same for me.);Not only step-mothers as I noticed.The fathers are usually good, wise and thoughtfull (I&apos;m right after the story about The Straw, The Bean and The Coal).Mothers like in &quot;Hansel and Grethel&quot;, &quot;The Three Spinsters or &quot;The Raven&quot; are always the bad ones.  Not only mothers but women in overall too like in &quot;The Fisherman and his Wife&quot; and put in the bad light like in &quot;Clever Grethel&quot;. Evil witches...Where are the bad men? One example is the King in the story of soldiers, other the The Wonderful Musician. The second still concerns me, why the Musician was not punished.PS. I apologise for spelling mistakes if any in the stories&apos; titles.;Although I do not agree with everything you said, the first point you made regarding the causes are exactly what i was going for. The thought that the kings had a right to rule is a given, because if you think about it, when someone is rich and has everything handed out to him/her just because he/or she was born to someone already with power, then that can only mean that that person is in fact lucky, from birth. On the other hand, that would mean that people who weren&apos;t lucky to be born like that would have to accomplish great deeds in order to change their status (because being born again into a different family and strata is not an option).That being said, I cannot agree when you say that people of low birth have their skills taught o them. So far, from what I have read, it seems those people already have those skills and they just never noticed or actually used them to their advantage. Take the story of the little tailor who killed seven flies with one strike for example; one cannot assume he only found out he had all that cunning in him by killing a bunch of flies, that was just the motto for the story to start, an excuse for him to have something to brag and make himself noticed.;Hmmm. Is there a history of matriarchy in Northern Europe? I don&apos;t remember learning that (though it&apos;s entirely possible that I am simply unaware....).;Hi Byurakn, Yes, I hadn&apos;t noticed that. You are right, the simplicity is part of it. The way they portray the human, is devoid of complexity, too. I just finished reading a very modern novel, Little Brother, and comparing the two works, I can definitely see this. And also conflicts are resolved withing fairy tales without much dwelling. Like in that horrifying faithful John, the horrific decision the king makes at the end about his children, is made in a line. It makes me think of the contemporary debate on free will. As much as some of the tales are morality tales, the way they are presented sides with the system view of free will, that each person, the system that he is, behaves and decides in a certain way, not much dwelling. Cinderella is kind and obedient by nature. She doesn&apos;t dwell on whether or not to confront the stepmother. If some character shows a change, it&apos;s due to seeing the result of what he has done, like in the raven. Then his system changes to another one.  Very illuminating thought,Thanks;</string>
            <string>I studied history at university and have always loved literature. I find contextualising a piece of literature by learning about the era and part of the world it was written in incredibly enlightening to my reading. Often I will read first and then research afterwards, as others have said, it&apos;s a good idea to get your own perspective first, even if that perspective is all over the place at least your head is filled with ideas which are placed there by the literature itself as opposed to other sources. I like to read other sources which are not directly linked to the novel or story itself (for example for the Grimm Tales I just googled nineteenth century Germany, looked for a decent enough webpage, and I&apos;m now faced with a wealth of information which is allowing me to further develop my ideas and I can go back to the Grimm text with new insight into my original points).;Hoi Byurakn,Niet Groningen, maar wel... Rotterdam.er is ook een post met als titel &apos;Nederlands&apos;.  Veel plezier!!groetjesAnnemarie;I added you as a friend on GoodReads. I am thinking of visiting Groningen in summer, if summer will ever really happen here   ;-)  Maybe &apos;tot ziens!&apos;;Agreed!;During the video Professor Rabkin states the preferred translation includes all the stories he wants us to read but one. Anyone know the title of the fairytale that is the but one? Do we need to read it or is it just going to be part of the lecture? ;Hi all! I&apos;m Armenian but I speak Russian.;Oh, The Railway Children was my favorite book when I was a child. Actually, it was the first book ever that I read in English.Currently reading The Portable Poe (yeah, I&apos;m a bit ahead of time because I&apos;m sure 5 days are not enough for me to finish a book).;I started to love reading even before I knew the alphabet. As a child, somehow I was convinced that as soon as I learn the alphabet I will start reading. I was wrong because I started reading even before I knew the alphabet! My school was going in a slow pace (one or two letters a week and my language has 39 letters), so learned rest of the letters by myself and picked up a book. That&apos;s how it started. Then my grandmother had to provide me with books, so for a long time I mostly read what she liked, unless she wasn&apos;t around and I picked random books from my mother&apos;s bookshelf.;I&apos;m sure all the tales have a certain meaning. We&apos;re just not there yet to understand them. It&apos;s good that you pointed out Fred and Kate and Clever Else because I wanted to open a separate topic about these two stories to discuss them from a cultural point of view.The thing is that we have similar tales in Armenian culture but the messages are much simpler or I&apos;d rather say they are constructed in a way that you totally understand what they&apos;re talking about. In the one that is equivalent to Clever Else, a father sends his eldest daughter to bring water from the spring. She goes there, notices a tall tree and starts to think that if she gets married, she will have a son, he will climb the tree, then fall from it and die. And she starts crying. Then the second daughter is sent to the spring. The eldest daughter tells her the story, they start crying together. The youngest one and then their mother is sent. They all sit there and cry. Finally the father goes there and after having learned the story he suggests to stop crying and to have the funeral of the child and carry on.In my culture it&apos;s a common practice to start worrying about something that hasn&apos;t even happened yet or that you haven&apos;t tried it out. I think it is very well shown in the tale and a solution is provided. The tale suggests get rid of non-existing worries by burying it.As for Clever Else, the plot is similar but the message doesn&apos;t seem to be the same because it&apos;s not focused on Else&apos;s worries, it&apos;s rather pointing out how &quot;clever&quot; she is. I think there is some kind of irony in it. Also, I don&apos;t understand the second part of the story about Else&apos;s laziness. Does the tale have a message against quick marriages? Is it making fun of female mind, showing that a female cannot be clever? These are my suggestions but I might be wrong.;Javier, I don&apos;t know. :) But my guess is that if &quot;the boy is already dead&quot;, then cutting down the tree won&apos;t help, a funeral is a better idea.;karishma, I know it&apos;s strange but it&apos;s also what Else worries about. By the way, while posting this comment I came up with an idea. If we have a look at Germans, in general they like planning their lives well ahead. Sometimes it&apos;s so extreme that someone who has just started their professional career, starts making plans for retirement. Maybe that&apos;s what&apos;s reflected in Clever Else and that&apos;s why she&apos;s actually considered as &quot;clever.&quot;Ah, about my name. Well, it&apos;s not a very common one in my country either. If you can read IPA, then this is the way to pronounce it: [bju   _  k  n];Actually I had an impression that Stoker was criticizing the concept of New Woman. I think he was more trying to show to beauty of each gender in their roles and how complementary they are. I also think that Mina was presented as an exception to the general rule (having told that she has a masculine brain already underestimates the feminine brain) but in the end of the story puts her where she belongs.  ;Indeed, I&apos;ve noticed something about time in Through the Looking Glass, when Alice meets one of the Queens, who has a backward memory (i.e. remembers things before they happen).;Everywhere in the course it says that we have to assess at least 4 of our peers but a minute ago as I was doing that, the system showed at least 5 students. So what is the correct minimum number?;It&apos;s a bit weird for me to grade cut down marks for language when I&apos;m not a native speaker myself. However, it is always easy to see if the errors are a result of being a non-native speaker (in some cases I can even guess what&apos;s the person&apos;s native language) or they were simply too lazy to proof-read it.  ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m not sure about the first book but the second book has very clear laws. Everything is happening according to the laws of chess. For example, Red Queen running around refers to the chess figure queen who can &quot;run&quot; on the chess board.  ;Actually I was very happy to get a 4 because I was sure it was what I deserved. There was nothing extraordinary in my essay, nothing too bad, my grammar is not perfect but I know how to structure an essay. So yeah, 4 is a very good grade. Why worry?  And I think this grading system should not be converted to ABC. Grading systems are always complicated and they have different standards. I think Prof. Rabkin made it clear that the majority should receive 2&apos;s, so what&apos;s the problem?;</string>
            <string>I totally agree about your remark on structure. The only thing is that us, non-native speakers will never get a 3 for structure, unless it is graded by non-native speakers as well. The problem is that no matter how grammatical our texts are, it always sounds weird to a native speaker. So I will try to improve my content to get a 3 but there is nothing I can do about structure, not even after a native speaker proofreads it.;Indeed, being exposed to Dutch English in my everyday life, I was trying very hard to find that same version of English in Dracula but it was not there. Actually, the most striking thing about this language issue was that one character reporting the other&apos;s speech used their language rather than converting it to their own. Well, I guess Stoker didn&apos;t know much about psycholinguistics.  ;Am I the only one who is happy with all the comments she gets so far?  ;Yeah, early release would be great. I&apos;m actually very well ahead of schedule, I&apos;ve almost done half of the readings, so it&apos;s a bit disappointing to see the before you read videos long after I&apos;ve finished the book.;Anna, interesting comment about Hansel and Grethel. Somehow I had the impression that Victor takes on God job, creating an intelligent animal and that&apos;s the reason he fails.;I&apos;m more than halfway through the book and I also dislike the protagonist and I feel kind of sympathy towards the monster but I&apos;m not sure if it was what the author meant.  ;Totally agree, Cheri. I would add that Frankenstein was the one who created the creature, so he should have known what he was creating. It was Frankenstein who gave him the monstrous appearance, so there must be something devilish hidden in Frankenstein and not the monster.  ;I&apos;ve already finished the readings for this unit. What I&apos;ve seen in Hawthorne&apos;s work is the impossibility or short life of perfection.  ;Yeah, same here. There was enough chasing throughout the book anyways.  ;After having read Elizabeth&apos;s letter to Victor, where she mentioned that William was taller for his age, I had an impression that he was at least in his teens. As he died, they started referring to him as &quot;child.&quot; I thought maybe it was because of grief or because he was younger than Elizabeth and Victor anyways, so a teenager might as well be a child for them or maybe he was still in his early teens. But as soon as I reached the part where the monster told the story how   he killed William, I became terribly puzzled, as William&apos;s words about his papa sounded like a four-year-old&apos;s. Also, the other thing I know is that William can&apos;t be younger than six years, if he was born shortly before Victor left Geneva. So approximately how old was William when he died? Have I missed something or Shelley herself didn&apos;t give him a proper age?  ;oh, I reread that part. it turns out that Ernest was sixteen, not Wiliam. so confusing. is it me or the book didn&apos;t tell what happened to Ernest?;As I was traveling last week, I managed to submit my essay just an hour before my flight but I couldn&apos;t grade any essays, as I didn&apos;t have internet while I was traveling. I know that it&apos;s a general rule in Coursera, if you don&apos;t submit feedback, you don&apos;t receive one. To my surprise, I received feedback. Does this mean that my grade is going to be counted or did I misunderstand the rule, I receive feedback but I don&apos;t receive credit? Although I got a lower grade this time (a 3, just what it deserved, since I didn&apos;t make grade efforts), I&apos;d be happy if it was counted. I am willing to review around 10 essays this week, as a compensation for not doing it at all last week.;Same here. I had to try really hard to keep myself focused on the book.;</string>
            <string>Yeah, I would also like to have more time for evaluating the essays but not for spending more time on each individual essay. I think having only two days in the middle of the week can be difficult for many people, especially those who are having a busy week. Of course, it won&apos;t be changed for this course but maybe it&apos;s something the staff might want to consider for future courses.;There is something else I just thought of. Actually, Victor keeps complaining about how miserable he is because all of his loved ones are dead. He has nobody else left on earth, so he&apos;s lonely but hold on... doesn&apos;t he do the same to the creature? Doesn&apos;t he deprive him of possible happiness with a companion? I think the monster kills everyone to make Victor feel what he feels but Victor refuses to understand it until the end of his life.  ;Anna, yes, it&apos;s something I asked in another thread. So Ernest stays alive, after all. I thought I missed something.  ;My answer would also be yes at least to the first two questions. If you compare it to the creation of Adam, God thought that it&apos;s not good for a man to be alone and created a woman for him, while Frankenstein is selfish and doesn&apos;t want to understand what the creature thinks.  I can&apos;t say anything about the creature family and what would have become of them, it totally depends on the author of the book. My idea is that Frankenstein, as their creator, should have control over them at least to some extent, such as making them infertile, thus avoiding reproduction.  ;I don&apos;t want to sound harsh but could it be the comments are not as mean as we see them? I mean, I&apos;m really happy with my grades (4, 3, 5) and they totally reflect the effort I put in. My first essay was good but nothing special, the second one was something for the sake of submitting something because I didn&apos;t have a clear idea what to write about (and I got 1 for content) and I worked much harder on my Dracula essay. The comments were sometimes contradicting (perfect grammar vs. many grammatical mistakes, so far the best essay I&apos;ve read vs. this essay doesn&apos;t make any sense) but the grades actually averaged to what my essays deserved. Moreover, I agreed with most of the criticism and with what I didn&apos;t agree, I just let it go.This is my second MOOC. Peer evaluation is involved in the previous one, too. Actually I finished that one with almost maximum grades but the peer review for the last assignment was striking. Everyone gave constructive feedback, except for one peer, who just gave &quot;excellent&quot; for every section. It was more insulting for me than if someone would have written &quot;failed&quot; because I had already read the example solution and I knew I did not give perfect answers to some of the questions. Do you want to see these empty &quot;excellents&quot;?I&apos;d suggest everyone to take things easier and not to forget that we&apos;re all from different countries with different backgrounds and we don&apos;t understand things the same way. I know, there is a small number of people who are having fun trying to insult others. I think the best thing to do is just ignoring them. After all,   and the large number of reviews helps to average out a grade we deserve.  ;I had the same thought when reading the book. Where were the editors?  ;English is not my native language and I normally don&apos;t comment on grammatical errors, unless they are really striking ones (e.g. omitting -s in verb inflection for third person singular) but the essay I have just reviewed was way too far from being written in English. I had a feeling it was google translated. Some foreign words were still remaining in the text.In general, the structure was fine, I could see the thesis, examples and conclusion but it was very difficult to understand. The author was trying to discuss an interesting topic, the examples were fine. So I actually gave 1 for structure and 2 for content. What would you do in such cases?;Jeremy, thank you for the explanation.Being a linguistics student myself, I can even guess the native language of the author based on the errors. I know that I make many errors related to articles and aspect. Although the -s omission is a striking mistake, I never cut marks for it and I give 2&apos;s. But when it&apos;s a google translated essay... I just don&apos;t know how to deal with it and I don&apos;t want to sound harsh because I know that some people really do try hard (and actually I could see it from the content).I am familiar with IELTS. I&apos;ve done the test almost 4 years ago and got 7.5 (then my English was much worse than it is now). But thanks for the link, it looks helpful.;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t think Coursera shows word count of other people&apos;s essays but in the beginning I was very curious, so I pasted several essays in Word to check the word count (because some of them looked really small). So if anyone else does it, it should be fine, if you&apos;re within the word limit in Word.;I love the idea of having a science study group. I am about to complete my MSc in Clinical Linguistics but I&apos;ve also studied medicine and I hold an MD. I find it really entertaining to point out the scientific mistakes the authors made in their work, such as blood transfusion in Dracula.  ;Actually it&apos;s the other way round for me. 50% of the reviews were not useful for me and it is the 4th week in a row that I get reviews from 4 peers.;No, I don&apos;t see it as a horrible sin. It&apos;s just something that I am able to notice as a non-native speaker, that&apos;s why I gave that example. I never mark down anyone just for omitting an -s. I just write in the comments that they should pay attention to it.;I&apos;d be happy if there were specific topics. Otherwise, I stick to the easiest topics, keeping myself in the safe zone and not making extra efforts.;Emma, I totally agree with you. I got such a comment for my form part today, &quot;Forme was not incorrect, but the argument is a fallacy.&quot; In the content part he or she goes on pointing that Prof. Rabkin said we should discuss literary matters. What can I say to this reviewer? Watch your spelling? Add some information on how the feedback should be written according to the professor? No way, it would turn into a fight. So I&apos;m glad we don&apos;t have the chance of talking to our reviewers. It saves time and nerves. Besides, there is always some constructive feedback, which helps me to learn more. Although, I must admit that this week I got constructive feedback from only two peers (as there is also a positive feedback that doesn&apos;t help me at all).  ;I think nothing is ever enough. If the word limit was 1000 words, there would still be people who would think it&apos;s not enough. The same would be with 2000 and so on. So I think it&apos;s a good exercise to try to say something important in just 320 words.  ;Thanks for telling, it&apos;s on my watchlist :)  ;I don&apos;t know about this course but the one I took before (statistics making sense) had about 45 000 participants. But I don&apos;t know how many of them managed to earn statement of accomplishment.;I am also happy with the course. Of course, it takes much time and from next week I might even fall behind the schedule, since I started reading the books in advance and the course is going faster than I do. Still, I think it&apos;s worth the time. And I absolutely love reading other participants&apos; essays and discussion forums. It is also a great new experience for me, since I haven&apos;t done any literature courses before.  ;I think I&apos;m also an addict but since I&apos;m also a perfectionist, I cannot take more than one course at a time, so I keep adding courses to my watchlist, to make sure I always have that one course to follow.The only online course I have had so far is statistics making sense and it was great. After having struggled with statistics for so many years it really started making sense to me. Moreover, I enjoyed the whole process of learning. So if there is anyone who is struggling to understand statistics, I recommend this course.;Somehow this birthmark looks like a mark left after slap. Could it symbolize a slap on the face that was there to prevent the existence of perfect beauty?  ;I&apos;ve read Bradbury many years ago but it didn&apos;t really get me into Sci-Fi. Now that I&apos;m reading Wells for the next unit, I&apos;m totally thrilled. I think I should read more Sci-Fi. I love it!;Yes, I will definitely try Bradbury again. Well, I have to for this course.Orwell&apos;s 1984 is on my to read list but I never get there. I&apos;ve read Jules Vernes as a kid and I also found Journey to the Center of the Earth pretty slow and boring.;So far I&apos;ve only read The Island of Dr. Moreau  by Wells and I&apos;m currently reading The Invisible Man  and I&apos;m really-really loving it.  From Bradbury I&apos;ve read Farenheit 451 Degrees,  which was ok, I didn&apos;t hate it and  Dandelion Wine, which I loved but according to my understanding of SciFi, it is not SciFi, and also the Martian Chronicles  which I really hated but it was very-very long ago, so I might change my mind in this course.;I love this topic!I have different writing patterns for different fields. For this course, I come up with a thesis well before starting the actual writing process. Then I start thinking and thinking of examples, of sentences and ideas I would like to use in my essay. When the thinking process is done (it&apos;s usually by Sunday or Monday afternoon), I start writing the first draft always watching for the word limit. Then I leave it like that and revise my essay just few hours before the deadline on Tuesday. Well, I know that I&apos;m not making too much effort and my theses are always something obvious, though I like going deep for finding examples.I&apos;m currently writing my MSc thesis, which is much tougher. I just come up with thoughts and write it down here and there. I have no idea how I am going to join them together in the end.But then there is creative writing, which I absolutely love doing and I do it in my native language most of the time. That&apos;s when writing comes to me very easily. People don&apos;t believe me that I can write a 2000 word short story in just 40 minutes. Of course, then I need to spend many hours editing it and making it look the way I want to (which never happens). The same goes for my blog posts. If I have half an hour and I don&apos;t know what to do, I just write a 1000-2000 blog post about anything I can think of.;Same here. This is the first time that I haven&apos;t given a 1 to anyone. Four 4&apos;s and one 5 so far but I might go on and review some more essays. I love this process!;Anonymous, even if someone doesn&apos;t explicitly tell that he or she is not a native speaker, it&apos;s very easy to see. I&apos;m not a native speaker myself but I always spot the non-native speakers. However, I think someone should not be marked down for mentioning that he or she is not a native speaker. I imagine he or she has received many harsh comments before or even low grades for not writing in perfect English.  ;Someone mentioned a story that wasn&apos;t on the syllabus in their essay but I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it because the author said that The Birthmark, Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter and that story have a common theme. So it was ok, I could still understand what they were talking about. I didn&apos;t mark down for it.;I had something discussing the genre of short stories in general and briefly mentioning Poe and Hawthorne. There was nothing about the required reading and the form wasn&apos;t quite ok either because it was less than 270 words. In fact, if you cut out all the irrelevant sentences, probably only 200 words would be left. So I tried to be nice but I gave 1 for both form and content. I hope I haven&apos;t done anything wrong.;Georgy, is this the one you&apos;re talking about?  http://www.planetaskazok.ru/bajovp/kamennyjcvetokbajov;</string>
            <string>I was thinking of expanding my essays beyond 320 words and translating them into my native language, after which I might post them on my blog, which is entirely in Armenian.;I love this passage, &quot;Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him. &quot;Understand me!&quot; said the dressing-gown. &quot;No attempts to hamper me, or capture me! Or-&quot;&quot; I can&apos;t stop laughing.  ;I&apos;ve reviewed 14 essays and I&apos;ve failed only one and half-failed another. I gave 4-6&apos;s to the others. But I&apos;ve also noticed that I&apos;m becoming more demanding. An essay that would receive a 6 from me in Grimm&apos;s unit, receives only 4 now.;I think not everyone is watching the videos before marking. Last week I received a comment that I shouldn&apos;t have compared Frankenstein and God, the monster and Adam, that I was totally biased and so on but actually the professor also talks about it.  Anyway, I also don&apos;t watch the videos before grading simply because there is not enough time. It&apos;s already time to write an essay for the 6th unit but I haven&apos;t finished watching the Frankenstein videos yet (not to talk about Hawthorne and Poe). But when it comes to grading, I actually try to understand what the author of the essay says and how he or she says it. Someone could have completely missed the point but if the arguments are good enough, I have no reason for marking down.;It should be fine. Even if your grading was not accepted, you will receive a grade for your essay. I had it in the second week when I was traveling and had no internet access to review any essays. I received a grade like in any other week.;Oh, actually the idea of quiz also came to my mind after thinking that some of the reviewers actually don&apos;t read the material.;So far, I&apos;ve never titled my essays (just to save some space for the word count) but this week I got a suggestion to have a title (though I wasn&apos;t marked down for it). What do you think?;Oh, that&apos;s a great idea and saves space.  ;Oh, in my culture we do start lunch with a main course.  ;Do you think Wells is making fun of religion in the passage with the Sayer of the Law? It seems to me that the passage is a parody of a religious service.  ;Good to know. I was afraid of misinterpreting it.;Oh, great. Actually I was thinking of making the grotesque society (and grotesque religious group as part of it) and how it changes with a new leader as my essay topic but somehow I feared that I might have misunderstood the book.  ;Actually I saw some elements of racism as well.  &quot;With him it was chiefly the brain that needed moulding; much had to be added, much changed. I thought him a fair specimen of the negroid type when I had finished him...&quot;;Let&apos;s use this thread to discuss the scientific errors we find in this week&apos;s material. Of course, there are things that were not discovered yet in the end of 19th century but I think it will be fun to find out what he got wrong by then.For example, in  The Island of Doctor Moreau, Dr. Moreau discusses the issue of making animals talk and he succeeds by just operating their vocal organs. However, nowadays it is clear that the reason of animals not talking is not just about the anatomical structure of their mouth and throat but also it is about brain structure (animals don&apos;t have Broca&apos;s and Wernicke&apos;s areas).Also, in  The Invisible Man Griffin says that he couldn&apos;t go down the stairs because he couldn&apos;t see his feet. It would be true if, besides being invisible, Griffin lost his proprioception for some reason.  Any other examples?;I think you&apos;re right. Do you remember that famous test touching your nose with your index finger with your eyes closed? Every healthy individual can do it. And even if you can&apos;t quite walk down the stairs in darkness, it&apos;s not because you can&apos;t see your feet but because you can&apos;t see the stairs.  ;The question is not about animals being able to have language or language like signaling system. The question is about human language. You can never operate an animal in a way to make them able to learn the human language. It&apos;s not about vocal tract, it&apos;s about brain. It&apos;s something Wells didn&apos;t know by that time.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;d split the difference here.   It is helpful to know the historical facts for the setting of a story, but not necessarily the Author&apos;s mindset or critical reviews of the piece.   As a reader, I have the knowledge of my own learning and experiences to affect the reading.   A younger reader with less education and experience will not read it the same way and is likely to miss many themes the author included.   Likewise, another person from another lifestyle or country will likely make different connections than I when reading that very same passage.   With or without research, everyone&apos;s experience will be their own and unique.What is the best method for this course?   Unless the instructor says otherwise, I&apos;m going with &quot;It&apos;s up to the individual.&quot;   As for me, I&apos;ll just be reading the passage and writing my essay tempered by whatever else I already have in my head.   Could I enrich the experience with further research?   I&apos;m not saying &quot;no.&quot;   I&apos;m saying, &quot;I&apos;m not going to at this time.&quot;   Maybe later.;It can be if you make it seem as if the ideas are your own.  Although, this is my experience of it through psychology papers. Whilst in English, it is far more reasonable to gain similar insights to books and the like as other critical sources, in Psychology it&apos;s less so. My tutor basically said that anything that isn&apos;t common knowledge and something that you have concluded yourself should have a reference, even if you&apos;ve forgotten where you might have learned it.-shrugs- Different disciplines have different variations on the same idea.  ;</string>
            <string>I can&apos;t find anything about &apos;not making connections to things outside of the stories&apos; in the instructions. It does say, focus on the literary material in the reading and don&apos;t just use it to spin off a thesis about something outside the stories (eg the role of beauty in modern life). Am I missing something?I would certainly like to cite some external references (eg Bruno Bettelheim&apos;s wonderful book The Uses of Enchantment), and there is a spot on the assignment response page to do this.;&quot;I have said it thrice:What I tell you three times is true.&quot; (Lewis Carroll, The Hunting of the Snark)Three is the first &quot;magical&quot; number - everything happens once; if it&apos;s repeated, that gives it some reason for attention; but if it happens three times then you know it&apos;s important. It&apos;s a common trick in rhetoric -- President Obama has used it. Repetition in three is common throughout literature. But in the Grimm Tales it&apos;s striking how &quot;boilerplate&quot; some of these repetitions are. The Brother&apos;s Grimm couldn&apos;t use copy and paste, but that&apos;s what it feels like!;</string>
            <string>And yet I don&apos;t find Alice to be that &quot;perfect little girl&quot; at all. She has very decided opinions and a very fresh take on the adult world. You could, in fact, read the books as a metaphor of the way that children cope with a very confusing adult world, in which so many things don&apos;t seem to make sense. Alice is certainly not a doormat (nor a dormouse!) -- look at her reactions to the unfairness of the trial at the end of the first book.;Is this really in the public domain? I would be surprised.Having said that, however, if you can get hold of a copy of The Annotated Alice (I have an old Penguin edition) it is great value, though it makes reading the book far slower as I can&apos;t resist reading all of Gardner&apos;s notes.;</string>
            <string>Anyone else read the graphic novels about &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O&apos;Neill? In these, Mina Harker becomes a very dominant character and is in fact the leader of the group of men, so clearly Moore thinks she is a strong character. Moore has a wonderful way of weaving allusions to a vast array of existing literature and legends together into a coherent story. Not very relevant to our current course, perhaps, other than to show that great classic literature does continue to spur creative endeavour long after it was written.;The &apos;sperm&apos; is from the candle - which would have been made with oil or wax from a sperm whale.;The consecrated wafer is meant to literally be the body of Christ, and the consecrated wine to be literally the blood of Christ. To a believer, consuming these is meant to bring eternal life. Is it interesting that the wine (blood) is never used as a weapon against Dracula, whose whole enterprise is about blood and the life it gives? I don&apos;t know.I do think that the wide range of limitations on Dracula&apos;s power is a whole grab-bag of different things -- the religious symbols, the garlic, the inability to enter a house unless invited, the inability to cross water, etc. I&apos;m not sure what these all have to do with each other.;[spoiler ahead!]I thought Dracula&apos;s final defeat was rather an anti-climax.  All our heroes do is to intercept the wagon, pitch out the crate, and slash Dracula to bits. I really expected some dramatic near-reversal of their fortunes at this point. An attack of wolves, or the gypsies showing more spirit, or (best of all), Dracula awaking and causing mayhem for a bit before his ultimate defeat. It just seemed a bit flat from a narrative point of view.What do you think?;</string>

            <string>And yet the artist has all but destroyed his life -- given up his hopes of love -- all in pursuit of the creation of an ephemeral device of no practical utility. Are we meant to sympathise with the artist, or criticise his futile pursuit? I find it interesting that the butterfly is destroyed at the end by the child of the woman he once loved.;</string>

She had a legitimate concern and voiced it - that&apos;s part of what a forum like this is for. :);All,I apologize for getting anyone riled up. As Julie said, I was merely voicing a concern I had and wanted clarification about. I certainly did not intend to start an argument with anyone, anonymous or not. : /  Julie: Thanks for your response. I am not worried about points or grades and I too have had some very wonderful experiences with peer responses. I only have a moral objection with the marks given by peers being a part of the overall grades of all the students. The reason I asked now, as opposed to later, is that the process of grading has a major impact on my participation in the course. Thank you for understanding.;Hmmm, I think there is a reason to be concerned, actually. I was taking a class last semester on campus and we had peer reviews of the papers we wrote. The paper that got the highest marks by the students was posted on the school&apos;s website. Only a few weeks later, our teacher realized it was plagiarized. None of the marks we gave the papers counted in the final grade, but it certainly made the school look foolish. So, I can see why Katrina might have a question about this type of grading.;</string>
            <string>Christopher, I&apos;m not in the UK so I can&apos;t take advantage of your generous offer, but it occurs to me that you might want to mention whether/how much you have marked *within* the book (either here or in your ebay listing). Some people won&apos;t care at all, or might see any marked pages as a bonus, and some might be like me and find marked pages distracting. You don&apos;t have to itemise every mark of course, but a general idea might be helpful - &quot;some words underlined,&quot; &quot;some page numbers circled,&quot; &quot;occasional notes in the margin&quot; or &quot;few to no marks&quot; would be sufficient, I think.;Algum falante da l _ngua de Cam  es?abs;</string>

            <string>Hi everyoneGoing back to what someone said before about not enjoying Alice as a child, I tried to remember if I did, and I don  t think I actually enjoyed their powerful nonsensical humor until I was a grown up, Rereading them I found myself roaring with pleasure at what that langage and style are doing,  Does anyone really remember enjoying the stories as children? It might be interesting to see how more people felt...I grew up with Enid Blyton&apos;s adventures (so you see I am a bit old) and the kind of sophisticated humor in Alice would fly by me.Anyone with young children mght care to conduct an experiment?...;</string>

            <string>Oi. Portugu  s de Colares, Sintra.;</string>
            <string>Algu  m j   escreve texto de fic    o?;That is something I&apos;d not consciously noted, but the moment I read your comment, it made absolute sense.In a lot of ways, the Tales do adhere to strict social structures. You may see social mobility based on skill and courage in working men and beauty and sweetness in working women, but the women in that group have to be sweet and beautiful while suffering, where the men have to be brave and clever. Sometimes princesses have to be chucked out of the castle to prove how sweet and beautiful they are while suffering. But, by and large, it&apos;s all about the high status men being already entitled to their luck and the low status men having to earn it. It&apos;s very socially conservative.I think it&apos;s a cracking thesis.;Fabio, I hate to be the bearer of negative counter points, but I can think of another one besides &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;. In the story &quot;The Knapsack, The Hat, and The Horn&quot; the main protagonist is a very poor boy who becomes successful through the luck of him finding a magical table cloth. His luck continues as he continues to find powerful magical items that he is able to steal, and use to eventually become king. I could be wrong, so do correct me if I am.;Byurakn, I think you&apos;re onto something... If one of them hadn&apos;t been there, the whole thing would have fallen apart. And yes, Sydney, that is one of the exceptions I was referring to.Fabio, that&apos;s a valid point right there. Although, I DID assume he found out about his skill by killing a bunch of flies. Perhaps I should re-read that. Thanks.That being said, I would like to point out that I was taking all of fantasy into account, not just the Grimms. Uhmmm... Let me get back from the office and I&apos;ll illustrate a few examples on this.... but if this is intended for your thesis (and that should cover just the Grimms) then perhaps I&apos;m overreaching. ;There&apos;s definitely snobbery and social discrimination in the tales.   When there&apos;s a King&apos;s daughter&apos;s hand in marriage up for grabs and the challenge is met by a &apos;lucky&apos; poor person, the King or his daughter always go back on their word and it&apos;s only by continuing to meet extra challenges set for them that the King or his daughter seem to give up and allow the peasant into their social class.;Oh, good! :);Oooh - Peggie, that&apos;s great!I don&apos;t know about German history, but I do know that the Vikings had a concept of hamingja  which was a part of the self connected with luck which could   be passed on to descendants and even loaned out. It seems the Norse viewed the self as a sort of gestalt entity comprised of various components that could be detached at will. The Saxons seem to have viewed the web of Wyrd  as the unfolding of fate, which had strings which could be tugged on to alter your luck - as long as you were exceptionally careful about it.;I think your thesis more or less applies to both genders.;I guess it&apos;s optional. I wouldn&apos;t share the final draft, but the idea, if you are in doubt.  ;I love the idea of your thesis, and I agree with others about the viewpoint at the time of the creation of the stories with nobility being considered to rule by divine right and perhaps continuing the round of luck they had beginning at birth to be born into their class. To that point, from the view point of the story tellers, who were probably all lower class, nobles were the lucky ones never having to work for anything while the commoners had to work to accomplish anything in their lives. It strikes me as a simple fact of existence for them and a lesson to the youngsters telling them they&apos;ll have to work for everything.;</string>
            <string>I think it&apos;s a good comparison and I think the moon cicle can also be used associated with the vegetable cicle to understand this fairy tale in the sense you have proposed (birth- growing up- marriage- death), . The hare is in some places associated with the moon and the moon is also linked to agrary cicles.  ;Hi, Here is my assignment:The Grimm Brothers&apos; Fairy tale    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN GOSLINGS    makes evident the semantic proximity of the symbols which represent the mother and the symbols which represent the death. When the goose mother departs to find food for her children, she advices they about the perils of death represented by the Wolf. In her advice the wolf can be recognized by the hoarse voice and the black paws. While the hoarse voice is an extension of the nibbling symbolism through the mouth image, the black paws integrate both the aggressive animal symbolism and the night/darkness symbolism. In according to the french anthropologist Gibert Durand animal and dark symbols might be understanding as the faces of death when negatively valued. The same kind of symbols when it   s euphemized and positively valued can represent the mother. For example, when the night brings a sensorial realism which induces comfort and when the action of biting become to swallow without hurting but protecting.   So when the wolf tries to disguise himself as the goose mother, the horrible aspects of his animalism and his darkness are precisely the elements which reveal him. But when he can disguise these specific aspects he can trick the little gooses and, not incidentally, he look likes their mother.On the other hand, it   s just because the death symbols are symmetric to mother/birth symbols and also because the digestive stomach is symbolically confused with the sexual belly and so with the womb which generates and protect the life that the mother goose can rescue her children of the wolf stomach.   The wolf who swallows the gooses seems to be pregnant of they and the goose mother can bring her children from the death to the life in a new birth .  Thank you for your comments.;</string>
            <string>Martha and Laura, thank you very much for your feedback. Your advices are very useful. Laura, I am not a native English speaker, so I really appreciate your generosity in correcting my poor grammar.   Martha, in his book Antropological Structures of the Imaginary, Gilbert Durand (2012) talks about the semantic proximity of the sexual belly and the digestive stomach in a very interesting way, however, he points Freud has noticed this proximity before.   Laura, I did not talk about the clock, but I think you are right; it is a very import symbol in this context. When Gilbert Durand talks about faces of death it is always associated with faces of time. Time symbols can be seen as death symbols, but when they are positively valued, they can announce progress, salvation and even victory over the death through life cycle.  I should to say yet, I have not read Durand   s book in English, I have read it in Brazilian Portuguese and it was originally written in French. I am sorry for possible misunderstandings. Here is the complete reference to the book I have read (in Portuguese) and a web link to the English translation on google books:  DURAND, Gilbert.

I have been writing for some time now, but last year I decided to do it more seriously and try to publish something. Unfortunately, I   m from Spain, and the publishing market there for short stories is almost non-existent. So, I decided to write them in English  _ but as English is only my third language, my skills are not good enough.   So, in a way, it would be great to be part of a study group with science fiction writers. However, I   m not sure if I can help you in anything, as my writing knowledge in English if far below yours.   Anyway, the initiative is great. If I can help in any way, please count on me.   Thanks,   Emma  ;I am also an aspiring science fiction writer.

All your ideas do not have to take off every time, but the possibility has to always be there.   When an idea hits it hits big generating far more value than your long string of small wins and losses.    Fortunately there is a new book, Berger   s Contagious on what qualities are needed for an idea to takeoff.   This book proposes six key concepts which can lead to an idea taking off, which are summarized in the acronym STEPPS:           S     Sociality Currency         T     Triggers           E     Emotion           P     Public           P     Practical Value           S -- Stories    This analysis is very encouraging because the elements fit the type of work we are proposing very well.     Here are some key points on how we can use each of the six STEPPS:       1.           S     Sociality Currency:   We need to make our ideas something people will want to tell their friends.        2.           T     Triggers:   This is about making the idea something that immediately brings positive images to the mind.   What we are proposing are believable space exploration adventures that most people can identify with.          3.           E     Emotion:   This is about the idea directly bringing up positive emotions.   The awe of space and the call of adventure are powerful emotions we will rely on.        4.           P     Public:   This is about people accepting the idea as part of their public persona and not just their inner self.   Most people feel it is Ok to be for Space.   The percentage is through the roof for technical people.        5.           P     Practical Value:   This is about seeing the idea as positive and good for society.   Apollo to the Moon was on most lists of the best thing in 20th century.   There is every reason to think that we can make a major space exploration adventure one of the best things in 21st century.        6.           S     Stories:   This is about communicating with people in a way that they enjoy relating too.   This is what our test project is all about.   The trick then is to turn these abstract concepts into direct action and stories that we can test in the market place.   It is all about Do.

However one  of my favourite writers  of the Sci-Fi genre is not included; Iain M. Banks.  I mention Banks in particular because he has recently announced that he only has months to live due to terminal cancer. He has asked his publishers to hasten the publication of his last novel, which, unfortunately is a non sci-fi book (i.e. the ones he writes without the M) and I feel so sad that I will never again read some new witty &quot;Minds&quot; ship name or accounts of their petty squabbling, let alone the beautiful, complex stories he writes and the social engineering that is the Culture.Thank you so much to Iain for the pleasure he has given me.

I then easily downloaded the e-book to IBooks on my IPad.This copy is much better then the free books version because it has the illustrations.Worked great.;We do need to note that the page numbers for e-publications are provided by the electronic reader and are different depending on which reader you are using.   For example, a page number may be different if you hold an IPad horizontal or vertical.   This makes it difficult to cite pages.   To make matters worse, most of our readings are converted from old paper books and not very well converted at that.   This makes even referring to chapters unreliable.     In a well converted e-book you can clearly jump to specific chapters at least.;A student copy of LeGuin&apos;s &quot;Left hand of Darkness&quot; is viable from the IPad story for $3.99.;My mistake, this is only a study guide.   I will have to buy the full book from Amazon for $9.99.;Getting Stuff Done in the 21st Century:        Plan&gt; Do &gt; Cycle  People worry about the great problems of the 21st century (like Global Warming), but that is only because they don   t see any to address them.   Fortunately there is a 21st century way to address the problems and writing fits right in.  The 21st century approach to getting things done is to have a very large number of people in action on a problem nearly continuously.     This applies to writing as much as to all the problem solving examples you have seen on TED.    The action happens when individuals or teams come up with an idea and form a plan.   They then take action that tests the idea in some way.   The results of the test teach us something new and the process starts all over again with new planning based on new information.  This approach is a refinement of standard practices that thousands of people have been using for some time.   The change for the 21st century is to now have tens of thousands of people in such action and then to grow that number using modern communication technologies first to millions and then to billions.   We can and will thereby address the great problems of the 21st century.  Most of the projects are small, intentionally so, like writing a short story for example.   Each project puts only as many resources at risk as the originator feels comfortable with.   To play for the long-haul you cannot risk everything on every play.  Most of the projects fail and that is OK.   The primary purpose of most of the projects are just to teach you something so that you can do better next time.   It is OK to fail fast if you can survive the loose and come back with new ideas just as fast.  Above all the emphasis is on Do, which for us here means write!

I have been stopped for months by the need to get permission to publish from the place I work.   I work at a major R&amp;D laboratory (which shall remain nameless) and they have a right to approve anything I publish.   They care a lot about technical publications because the quality of the publications of their people effects their brand value greatly.     A number of us however also publish Sci-Fi fiction.   They do not care as long as their name does not appear in the publication but they still insist on a complex approval process.   This process should take 4 weeks, but because they do not really care about Sci-Fi at all, this one has now dragged out to 14 weeks.       Assuming I finally get the official paper work early next week (as promised by phone) I will log my remaining steps to e-publication on this tread.   I will be closely following:         Mark Cooker,    SlashWords Style Guide          http://www.smashwords.com/b/52    I trust this will be of value to some of you.

E-publication is really self-publication unless it takes off.

If it does then the e-publishers will get behind the project and the sky is the limit. The marketplace is the test platform for e-publication and that is in many ways fair.So you cannot say your are truly e-published until you sell 1000 e-copies.

Callay!&quot;      He chortled in his joy.    In the 21st century all projects, even writing projects, must follow a number of rules.   One of them is    Fail Fast   .     This means that you do not have a bunch of projects hanging around unfinished.   If they are not going anywhere, you declare them dead, lean what you can, and move on to other actions.    We allowed 6 weeks in our plan for this approval, It took 14 weeks.   Such an unplanned delay is more than enough to kill at    Fail Fast Project   .       Fortunately we can start a new project on the ashes of an old one just as fast as we can kill dead wood.   So that is what I must do now.   For the next couple weeks I will be running down the now dispersed Volume 01 team and coming up with a new plan.      The new plan might look a lot like the old one or be quite different.   The key idea is that the action forward can adapt to setbacks and is therefore hard to kill or may even be antifragile.    I well post again when I have a new plan.    References:    *   Leonard A.

It is clear that the older works were scanned in electronically from paper copies and then automatically covered to text.   This process leaves a large number of misread   characters in the text.This is a tedious process for one person to do for a whole book but it is not so difficult for 40 people to do 10 pages each.   The process requires an editable copy, usually in MicroSoft Word, and a photo copy, usually in Adobie .pdf.   Gutenberg may let volunteers do this.In my last class, one of the profs did this for a paper by Einstein which was seen as a major contribution. There he had the much harder task of correcting a translation from the German of major physics concepts.   What I propose is much easier.;In    Little Brother   , Doctorow makes a political error early in his story and never recovers.   He echoes the strife of the 60   s in scenes and locations, but he has learned nothing from it.   (I was there in those mean streets.

Stories were either Progressive and anti-war, or Conservative and justifying it.    Our reading,    The Martian Chronicles    is a good example of the very conservative stories.   It is Middle America transplanted to Mars without technical explanation.   The very conservative Heinlein also hated that another of his stories,    Stranger in a Strange Land    was adopted by the hippies (left) but that is another story.    The best of the progressive stories grew into    Star Trek, The Next Generation   .   The best of the conservative stories grew into    Star Wars   .     Major lessons were learned, but different people learned very different lessons and many people learned nothing at all.   The major lesson that Doctorow failed to learn is:   When an argument starts, the group that controls the Frame of Reference has already won!    Frame of Reference:    Human beings cannot hold the total universe in their minds.   To operate in society what we do is hold subsets of reality in our minds called    Frames of Reference   .   Each person may hold many Frames, (parent, child, worker, or technical specialist) and can switch between them in a few microseconds.    The political identities are Frames in this since.     They are by necessity incomplete and all Frames cherry pick the facts that support them.   This Frames analysis was developed by the extreme left (Ref. 1) but was used most effectively by the extreme right.    President Ronald Regan was a master of Framing.   His    Welfare Queen    Frame contained very little truth but brilliantly reinforced the Conservative Frame.     President Regan was known as the    Great Communicator    but it would be more true to the history of his time to call him the    Great Framer   .    Today in a debate, such as abortion, if one Frame talks about    service providers    and another frame about    Baby Killers   , then whichever group controls the frame of the debate on day one has already won.   This is why no true debates are now ever carried on.    Broken Plot Line:    Two different frames related to counteracting terrorism are available,    War on Terror    and    Policing   .       About  _ of the way through the story, the author has a surprise second 9/11 level terrorist event which defines the frame for the rest for the story.   This event is so large that only an organized terrorist group could have pulled it off.   This allows the authorities to operate in the    War on Terror    Frame with confidence that the majority of the American people will back them up.   It then does not matter how extreme their actions.    From then on, no matter why the protagonist does what he does, under the War on Terror Frame he will be seen by a majority to be in cahoots with a foreign enemy.   The author has already lost his argument!    Just last week, President Obama week gave a major speech starting the process of converting the official frame for dealing with terrorism from    War on Terror    to    Policing   .     This is a major change but has not yet been widely appreciated.    Alternative Plot Line:    Had the author made the terrorist incident smaller, say a couple of yahoos with pressure cooker bombs, then the American people would be likely to see limiting of the authorizes to the Policing Frame as the correct response.   The protagonist could then be presented as a protector of personal liberties.   Then the War on Terror response of the authorities would be seen as way out of proportion.     Under a Policing Frame, the protagonist could have adopted a    Martin Luther King    Frame and used his powerful IT skills to upgrade this historic frame into the 21st century.   The Arab Spring Frame showed bits and pieces needed for this updating, but did not use enough of the Martin Luther King Frame to show the power that an update of this frame could have.   The author, through the protagonist, could have then won the day, and taught the reader a world-changing lesson in the process.    In short, a great possibility for this story was in view but the author blew it because he does not understand his own history.    If you would like to see where this kind of thinking leads to in Sci-Fi, please drop me an e-mail.

George Lakoff, The Political Mind:   A Cognitive Scientist   s Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics (Penguin, 2009)      ;Communism and Anti-Communism were both powerful Frames that drove the action for most of the 20th century.   Neither one achieved very much and both wasted enormous amounts of resources, but they did produce a lot of good stories (James Bond, etc.).   Replacing them with the War on Terror Frame is certainly likely to waste enormous resources and reduce personal liberty, but it doubt that it will produce much in the way of good story lines.;That was fast.I am not much worried about the character here.   What I regret is the author setting up the character to lose.   A 19 year old kid losing is not much of a story.     A 19 year old kid making a difference is a story.Given that all IT work is about dozens of small wins and loses and then an occasional really big win (called a Black Swan) for somebody.   The same drive that lead to a lose here could have been the big win if the author had set the story line up a little differently.I found this particular plot, boring and sad.;</string>
            <string>Hi John -  I&apos;m curious, why  would e-book readers necessarily be less patient with complex stories (including backstory)?   It seems e-books potentially serve 2 purposes/audiences:   1) increased convience and access for those interested in exploring classic literature (as close to the original version as possible),  and 2) conversions of texts  that change the content and format of ebooks for a modern audience.;Are you&apos;re looking for sci-fi short story submissions that will inspire people to embrace space exploration? Or do you just want us to be aware that you will be selling an e-book?  ;Just Do IT!I spent the last week communicating with my stakeholders on Vol. 01 (each volume is a separate cooperative venture) and everybody said just do it.     I will therefore be pushing ahead with the e-publication starting Friday, June 21.   I will make entries in this string as I progress.I hope this will be helpful for those of you considering publication of an e-book.Thanks,Tom Riley;56% of Americans accept NASA Phone Tracking    PewResearch Centro for the People &amp; the Press, published a major study (Refer) showing that 56% of the American people say that the NSA tracking of telephone records of millions of Americans is an acceptable way for the government to investigate terrorism while only 41% said it was unacceptable.    The telephone story broke a few weeks after the double bombing in Boston by two rogue actors with pressure cooker bombs.   In Doctorow   s story he has a double major bombing that could only be carried out by a large and well organized terrorist group.   After such an event the approval reading for extreme surveillance would be closer to 98% judging from 9/11.    The protagonist   s unrelated activities would surely draw attention and he would be detained indefinitely ending the story.   A much smaller incident and a clear over reaction from the authorities would have made a much better plot with a balance between more closely argued stands.    We will have to see how the    James Bond in the 21st century    frame plays out but after we add Big Data and killer drones to Bond   s usually gaggle of gadgets, the American people still want Bond on their side.    Reference:       Majority Views NSA Pho9ne Tracking as Acceptable Anti-terror Tactic    (Internet) http://www.people-press.org/2013/06/10/majority-views-nsa-phone-tracking-as-acceptable-anti-terror-tactic/    ;A new round of summertime science Fiction blockbuster movies is out and     they are letting us down by failing miserably to depict a believable future     for manned space exploration.   Stating with    Oblivion    and continuing     through the summer, each film costs more than $100,000,000; each has flawless,     breathtaking computer generated graphics; and each portrays a negative     future for human kind full of wars, terrorist acts, and ecological collapse.       The American people are owed something much better for their box office     money.   Apollo to the Moon made everybody   s top ten achievements of the 20th century.       There is no reason that a bold, adventurous space program cannot be in     the top ten lists for the 21st.   But to make that happen, billions     of people have to envision the action as a personal success, just as they     did Apollo.   In the 20th century specialists designed a major program, like Apollo,     and then leaders sold it to the public,    We shall go to the Moon  _   .       In the 21st century this entire process now runs backwards.   The first     step is now to envision the adventure in such a way that the idea runs     viral on the Internet and social media.   Then, if and only if, tens     of millions of people buy into the idea will there be any possibility that     the resources will be made available.  A new space mission idea now has to beat out    kitten playing the piano        before it can even get started.   So far, returning to the Moon and     going to an asteroid have both failed miserably in this bazaar contest.       New century; new rules.   Fortunately the new century has come with new tools.   The Silicon     Valley style entrepreneurial companies have lead the way.     Now     the universities are filling in their foggy thinking with solid academic     information on how the new process actually works.   The new system     may be running at the edge of Chaos, but it is now workable as a plan.   Today we must succeed spectacularly with a breakthrough idea, called a     Black Swan, because breakthroughs are the new norm.   Running hundreds     of small projects that win small or fail fast is now understood as the     plan of action     Plan &gt;&gt; Do &gt;&gt; Test &gt;&gt; Learn &gt;&gt;     Repeat --.   You never risk more than you can afford to lose and the     emphasis is always on Do. You are antifragile, not hurt by uncertainty,     you prosper from it.   It is your persistence in repetition that makes     sure you are there when a Black Swan wins.   There are now so many Black Swans in play that they have become the defining     concept of the 21st century.   Historically science fiction generated the vision that lead to Apollo     to the Moon and solutions of many other problems of we the people of Earth.       Current blockbuster movies do not do this, perhaps they cannot.   Fortunately     there is a new democratic movement on the Internet that I think can.   Yes, there are problems.   Chiefly resources spent on space exploration     are not available for working other real world problems.   This is     why programs must be widely appreciated before major resources can be applied.  We can organize to generate our vision.   We can tell the story before     the adventure happens and by so doing make the adventure happen.         The process will require diverse teams of technical people to work out     the implications of current science and humanities people to work out the     language, dialog, and characters.   Modern social media on the Internet     can do this job very well.   We have started small with an e-book of science fiction short stories     called Hard Squared Science Fiction, Vol. 01 and have started Vol. 02.   We have a     working site in the social knowledge site, So:Kno, under the title    Romancing     Black Swans    and are working up clear statements of why and how.   If your vision is of the human race moving out into space and it can embrace     teams of millions of Earth-bond participants active in the adventure, then     please join us.     Thanks,                           Tom Riley                         TomRiley@WoodwareDesigns.com     ;Your are of course correct that Apollo to the Moon was political theater, but it was glorious political theater.;Any artists owes his customers a quality product.

It is possible that some of the people in this course would benefit from being on my e-book team and I am more than willing to consider helping on any Sci-Fi team they may have open. Is this a money making deal?   Maybe but that would be along shot (a Black Swan).   Is this a good writing practice project?   I hope so, that is certainly more likely than money making.Is this about Fantasy and Science Fiction in Modern Society?   It certainly is.;Keep in mind that these blockbuster movies cost a lot of money.   Right now the people of Earth need a robot spacecraft in solar orbit trailing Venius with a   one meter infared telescope to find killer asteroids.

            <string>I got my e-book properly submitted to Smashwords on Saturday.     The process took about six hours, much of it because it was my first submission.   The most tedious part was having to reformat the complete book over from a plan text start.   The programs that convert the submission to the seven different e-book formats can be a little tricky.   If they fail they simply give you cryptic error messages that do not mean a thing to any human being on Earth.   The solution is to save the entire text as a .txt file and then go back through and reformat every heading, every link, the entire Table of Contents, etc. .   This took about two hours for my 60 page e-book but worked perfectly in the end.I am now waiting a review by Smashwords to see if they will put my e-book in their preferred catalog.   This should be easily accomplished by mid-week.;You might consider e-publishing with Smashwords too.   Amazon with its Kindle is a completely separate consideration so you have to to both to cover all possible readers.I am proofing my Kindle addition know and expect to have it in next week.;My singing has been compared to Bob Dylan -- unfavorably I am afraid--.

            <string>The first week after publication involved a lot of work sending out e-mails to everyone how had shown interest in the project and writing articles for local stakeholders.   This constitutes a formal announcement which turns out to be necessary.About 40 e-mails have resulted and a few congratulations, one promise to buy a book, two people interested in working on Vol. 02, and two people interested in the 21st century design processes I am using.

            <string>In all these stories the protagonist concentrates on one activity to the exclusion of all else and works a project with an intensity that is far from healthy.   Both qualities of the human brain are now well understood. The human mental condition where a person gets so intensely involved in an activity that he or she looses all track of time and personal comfort is now called &quot;Flow&quot; and is very well studied.   It can occur in any human activity.   In creative writing, authors described the state as the words flowing like a river, hence the name.   In music it is called being &quot;in the Groove&quot;.   In sports it is &quot;in the Zone&quot;.   Flow is a very enjoyable state of mind.Modern humans also have another mental state &quot;Buy-in&quot;.   Under buy-in a person accepts and idea as his mission, gets in action on the idea, and stays in action on the idea.   Buy-in is the key to modern humans achieving projects.Buy-ins study is not as widely published as Flow, but you can get training in its use from a number of sources.   Both these states of mind are supported by modules in the human brain.   ;Pigments are needed for VisionIn Well&apos;s &quot;The invisible Man&quot; he makes a point of the cat&apos;s eyes being very difficult to make invisible.   This problem is far more basic than the author discusses.   Without colored eye pigments, you simply cannot see.   The Invisible man would be blind.   These pigments adsorb specific bands of light and convert the energy into nerve impulses.   If they were made clear, then there would be no conversion, no nerve impulses and no sight.;</string>
            <string>Ditto;    Would anyone here be interested in working through this course as a member of a   science fiction writers study group?

We have started several story lines of hard science fiction short stories that we are forming into e-books.This is one of a series of Coursera courses I am taking to build by writing skills. This course, as I see it at the start, is a reader   s course and an English Lit course.   That is all well and good, but what I need to do is to learn to writer better stories.

            <string>In this video lecture, Professor Rabkin describes the process of historical linguistics, in which researchers can trace languages back to a source language, such as proto-Indo European. I just want to point out that one of his examples, finding the source language of Hindi and Sanskrit, is incorrect.  Sanskrit is the source language of Hindi, as well as Gujarati, Bengali, Panjabi, and the other north Indian modern languages. To find proto-Indo European, the linguists would have to work backward from Sanskrit, ancient Greek, and Latin, among others.  ;</string>
            <string>As I was reading the book, I found that Dracula&apos;s powers and weaknesses did not always correspond to those listed by Van Helsing.  If I recall correctly, the main ones that Van Helsing stated are:  - can be harmed/warded off by the host, garlic, crucifixes- can only cross water at high or low tide exactly, unless carried across- can only change form at twilight or dawn- sleeps in his coffin during the day on dirt from his homeland- can be killed by staking the heart, cutting off the head, and placing garlic in the mouthI know I&apos;ve forgotten some; please help me list them in this thread.  There are two incidents where Dracula appears to  not follow these restrictions:  1. The incident in the bedroom with Mina. He appears as a bat or mist, then changes into a man to hold Mina and make her drink his blood, and then vanishes again as a mist. This happened in the middle of the night.  2. The house at Piccadily, where he attacked the group during the day. He not only travelled during the day, but physically attacked them and then fled.  So what are we supposed to understand from these two incidents? Is this just a case of the author messing up, or does it mean that the protagonists don&apos;t actually understand the vampiric powers as well as they think they do?;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m experiencing the same thing.  I also noticed that now there&apos;s a link to enroll in Signature Tracking.  When I click on the link, it take me to a page that wants me to sign up for the service for an intro price of $39.99.  What is this service and is it worthwhile or necessary? ;BethI&apos;ll have to go check him out when I get back from my sister&apos;s wedding. One of the things I&apos;m looking forward to, is hearing who are folks favorite authors and books.Carrie;I have been reading Iain Banks and Iain M Banks books for a long time and was truly upset to hear the sad news. He is one of the authors that inspires me to write and he will be sorely missed. He will leave a legacy of work that will be enjoyed I hope for many years to come. All of the works I have read of his have a distinct feel to them, even the culture novels which are set in the same universe and have similar characters and technology still seem to occupy their own space. I am inspired by his insight into what it means to be human and the implications of emergent technology on our species. Those of you who haven&apos;t read any of his work yet, I hope that you do and I hope that you enjoy them as much as I have and still am.    ;</string>

            <string>I couldn&apos;t stand the books when I read them as a young girl and after trying a few pages now, about 50 years later, I can&apos;t bring myself to continue, so I am skipping this week.   However I will watch the videos to see what the Prof thinks of them/their meaning.(I believe Tenniel is pronounced Tenn-yell by the way Prof. not Tenn-eel).I have been trying to think why I hate them so much, as I have very broad tastes in literature, and I think it could be in part that Alice was just the personification of the kind of idealised little girl I was a million miles away from and I could not relate to at all. Long blonde hair, permanently in a party dress with a big sash and bow (the kind of thing my mother used to try to get me to wear at times).and very English establishment. (I am Welsh). I was a tomboy, crawling through hedges to play cowboys with the boy next door etc. - think Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird.Fortunately, like Atticus, my father appreciated intelligence and an inquiring mind more than looking like a perfect &quot;little girl&quot; and so I was allowed to be myself.( I am now an engineer so I suppose the lack of imposition of stereotyping in childhood was important!)So I formed an intense dislike for the central character in childhood and .it has stayed with me.I quite like some of Carroll&apos;s other stuff though like the Hunting of the Snark, and Jabberwocky, as a poem in its own right, divorced from the book.;That&apos;s pretty much the age I was when I first read these books and I thought Alice was extremely silly and unlikeable then so I don&apos;t think her age excuses her. ;I agree with you Nini and I also read a lot of SF etc. People should not try to chase you from the course for expressing your views, especially when hiding behind an Anonymous cloak! ;</string>
            <string>Well there are quite a few giants missing. The Professor had to select carefully and it must have been difficult! I would be very interested in knowing what his rationale was for his final choice! Some missing authors from my perspective are: Isaac Asimov, Iain M. Banks, John Wyndham, Brian Aldiss, Frank Herbert and for some light relief Douglas Adams (Hitchhikers Guide).Oh and Antoine de Saint-Exupery (The Little Prince).;Thank you so much for posting this.   I had not read it before and am a great admirer of Plath&apos;s work.;It does seem a little redundant to specify orange marmalade, as in general that is the default, not lime etc (agreed - delicious), unless other forms were common in Victorian England, like the quince someone mentioned. You can get the traditional forms in either coarse or fine ( i.e. the size of the peel bits). I know people who like it with sausages at breakfast - the British pork kind that you fry - and indeed I have it like that myself occasionally - it does add some interest to the taste!Marmalade on the breakfast table in the UK was I think much more common when I was a young girl, some 50 years ago: Robinson&apos;s Golden Shred, which is a very sweet, fine shred, mass-produced product - probably more palatable for children than the darker, more sophisticated marmalades, I tend to favour these days. Also you could collect the Golliwog tokens on the label (sorry very unacceptable term these days, but not back then - we are talking late 50s/60s) and send them off to get a Golliwog &quot;Golly&quot; badge.   There were lots of different types of badges so you could collect them and swap them with your friends in the playground. &quot;Golly&quot; was retired in 2002.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1505411.stm;Yes well put. My point, sort of (I didn&apos;t really express this in my post - it was just in my head!!) was that you wouldn&apos;t mention orange unless it was important to emphaises the colour in the context of the story. ;</string>

            <string>That is very good of you, and a safer bet perhaps, but I really think one should be able to write in the English that is natural, as long as it is spelt correctly according to the system one has been taught. ;Hi I have been on holiday (vacation - establishing my linguistic nationality from the outset!) and hence have only had occasional internet access, so you will excuse me for the fact that, having skimmed the posts in the middle, of which many seemed to me rude, and unhelpful, I shall just address the first poster&apos;s point and a couple of the latter helpful ones above. I crave forgiveness from any oth good posts I have missed by so doing and tarring with an inapproporate brush. I studied Greek and Roman Mythology last Fall/Autumn and there  was much concern on the boards about this very point, from people who had done this course, and we had a mere 1or 2 peer review essays to write. The upshot of this is that the Staff DID reply and make announcement or thread- I forget which - that made it clear people were not to mark down for British spelling. I therefore agree with the original poster that really the Staff/Prof. Rabkin should make a similar comment to people studying this course. If you are going to leave the marking to the students then you need to give them clear guidelines. (I also marked my essay for that course as written in British English). I know this is an American university course, but there are a number of people from the UK and also other parts of the world studying (great!!) I also think people from British Commonwealth countries, especially above a certain age, will probably have been taught in British English, if they had to pass English formal exams etc. so this is not a minority issue.  So, please Prof. say something, and indeed Coursera should if they want this wonderful international movement to flourish with the minimum of muttering from British English spellers! ;</string>
            <string>The Signature Tracking thing looks completely voluntary to me.   It&apos;s a service that will keep an online record of your completing this course so you can include a link to it in your resume or CV.   I think you will still receive a paper certificate if you don&apos;t sign up for it.;Janet, Signature Track is only offered for some courses, and they are all separate. I, personally, do not think it is worth it. You don&apos;t get much more than what you get for free. The course itself stays the same. The only difference is that with Signature Track, you get the ability to share your certificate with schools and employers (something you can do by printing it out), a verification code for your certificate, and a signature typing pattern which verifies that you haven&apos;t let anyone else do your work for you. For more information, click  here.;I don&apos;t think this is  necessarily a bug; I initially had the same problem but then I re-read the introductory message  which notes that  &quot;once you&apos;ve seen all  five [videos]&quot;  the More to Learn will be available. I watched the videos and then it all worked fine.So, to solve the problem watch all 5 videos, then the More to Learn content is available and you can complete the little test.;I just reclicked on all 5 video links and then the More to Learn assignment became available.   ;I had no trouble, but I had already watched all of the videos. As suggested above, I would assume that is the problem. Let us know if you are successful. If not, we will continue to help you find the problem!;</string>

            <string>Heya, here&apos;s an attempt at reviewing your essay - I have pretended I was grading it like the ones I was assigned to review and I hope that&apos;s okayForm - 2. You write well ordered sentences and use appropriate grammar, your grasp of the English language appears sound and your vocabulary is well rounded.   I would suggest using some paragraphs and white-space to give your essay a little more structure.Content - 2. I liked your take on this story and the way you have broken each character down into a personification of an aspect of the human psyche.   I&apos;m not sure I necessarily agree with you but your discussion is well rounded and was interesting to read.If you wanted to improve your essay I would suggest that you explore why you have assigned each aspect to each creature and how this reflects on the journey the cock makes through life (for example: why does the &apos;stone of acceptance&apos; let the cock and hen across but drown all the other creatures that followed them? What makes the Willow complacent? Why is the brook both apathetic and an expression of tribulation?)

            <string>Re Laurie&apos;s Essay:Overall I enjoyed reading your essay and thought this was a good piece, it is obvious you have done your own research and thought about what you are writing - I will quote another post and say &quot;A 4 is a good score&quot;!As you are asking for feedback I will try and make some suggestions:A couple of the phrases you use seem a little awkward to me (e.g. &quot;a  mostly correctly played  game  of chess&quot;) so you might be able to look at this a little more in the future (on the whole though your use of language is very good)I think that you could work on integrating your quotations into what you are saying - at the moment when you use a quote it tends to repeat what you have already said in your own words. It&apos;s hard to put into words but  as an example:You wrote:Alice first sees her chess board to be played as she and the Red Queen reach the top of the hill.   Alice, while looking out at the countryside declares,    It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)You could say:Alice first comments on the game of chess when she looks out over the countryside and declares     It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)I&apos;m not  entirely happy with my sentence but I hope you can see what I mean!The only other thing I&apos;d say is that whilst your last paragraph draws comparisons with Harry Potter you don&apos;t really say why it is interesting that they both use chessboards - I think that you could have linked this back to your thesis and  explained  why the metaphor of the game of chess appears across different  children&apos;s  novels.;Since I&apos;ve commented it seems only fair to share my own essay! I noticed the errors in the last sentence just  after the deadline to correct them passed :(Alice in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll (Overall Score 4)In Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland the Mock Turtle is source of many linguistic puns. When Alice first hears about him &quot;[she doesn&apos;t] even know what a Mock Turtle is&quot; until the Queen educates her by saying that &quot;It&apos;s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from&quot;.   In Victorian England Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel&apos;s illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. Carroll makes a clever dual pun out of the Mock Turtle&apos;s name - it is both a play on the nature of the soup (which is pretending to be something it is not) and on the nature of the turtle (which literally embodies its peculiar name).As Alice continues talking with the Mock Turtle more puns are introduced - Mock Turtle discusses his school life (a topic to which the child reader can easily relate) and refers to master &quot;Tortoise&quot;.   When Alice questions why a turtle would be called &apos;tortoise&apos; she is informed that is is because he &quot;taught us&quot; - this is an example of a homophone, a device which Carroll uses throughout the novel for comedic effect. The chapter continues with puns on school topics, for example &quot;Reeling&quot; and &quot;Writhing&quot; replace &quot;Reading&quot; and &quot;Writing&quot;. The puns in Alice in Wonderland are fairly obvious and are often expressly identified by the characters in the book - this is interesting as it shows us that Carroll was writing carefully for his intended audience.   If the child reader misses the wordplay it is brought to their attention and if they identified it themselves then they gain a sense of achievement for spotting it before the characters did.   In this way Alice&apos;s adventures are both amuse the young reader and a encourage them to think carefully about language and inspire them to use it creatively.Form - 2peer 1     So glad to see someone really enjoying the sad tales from the Mock Turtle episode and your including your research in a clear, concise way is also remarkable.peer 2     The student uses form and grammar correctly but some areas need commas in certain places and attention to details on various articles that are used. For example, In the first sentence, In Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland,(comma) the Mock Turtle is (a)source of many linguistic puns. Also, in this sentence, In Victorian England, (comma) Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel&apos;s illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. There are a few misspelled words and articles that are used twice. Possibly proofreading and having someone else read for you would make it perfect.peer 3     The structure of your essay was smooth and the progression was logical but there were some errors in your final sentence. Make sure to proofread carefully because these are easy to avoid.peer 4     You write well and you laid out a clear argument.Content - 2peer 1     Content offers insightful analysis and some research, thank you!peer 2     The content of the essay is great! I learned quite a bit from this essay. I would suggest to put the 3rd paragraph first but otherwise this student is on the right track. One thing I learned is that reading this book is interesting because of the puns that are used.peer 3     I enjoyed how specific the focus of your essay was but I would caution against using Wikipedia as a source since it can be easily altered. Instead, I would suggest using it as a springboard to find morr information.peer 4     This is a well-structured essay. If there was more room, you could have perhaps set up some of your concluding ideas in your introduction.;I&apos;ve been reviewing assignments this evening and one writer has noted that Count Dracula is unable to enter a home unless he is invited and that he is unable to seduce an unwilling victim.My immediate response was that those &apos;facts&apos; are incorrect but I am cautious about disputing this without being certain (and I did not focus my essay on this area so I am not certain).   Can anyone point me to any quotes from the book which support the assertions the writer of the essay has made?   My thoughts are thus:Whilst Dracula&apos;s entry to the asylum is facilitated by an invitation he is also shown to be able to circumvent the necessity for an invitation. Dracula uses a wolf to break into Lucy&apos;s bedroom through her window and I&apos;m not sure why he would do this if he had been invited into the house previously?I can also find no reference to the women being willing in the text. Dracula comes to Mina when she is drugged with a sleeping draught and threatens her with the death of her husband if she dares resist him and is said to be restraining  her as he feeds - to my mind this does not indicate &apos;willingness&apos;!Having said that - I&apos;d love to be proven wrong!;Ah, perfect - thank you.   I guess the wolf-through-the-window must have been to circumvent the garlic protections and that Lucy must have invited him into the house at some point previously.I very much appreciate you taking the time to point out the quote to me.;</string>
            <string>Not sure if it varies by region but I can see it on Kobobooks.com  for   4.49.;</string>
            <string>Cool idea. I&apos;ve used Goodreads in the past but I haven&apos;t really been reading too much lately so I created a new one. https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20985125-nikki-lahensFeel free to add me! ;</string>
            <string>Oh thank you for highlight Voyager. I get no end of hell for preferring this of all of the Star Trek shows. Also, Farscape is a must watch.;I thought she did it just to shut him up with his constant nagging. :) ;</string>
            <string>Even those with a decent understanding and education of a foreign language sometimes can make mistakes. For those here who are Native English -speakers and are being critical, I challenge you to attend a class in another language and see how you fair. While this is a literature class, this isn&apos;t a grammar class. While we do some writing, the focus of the class is fantasy and science fiction, not English grammar and structure. While yes, form is important, let&apos;s be a bit more compassionate and understanding of our English as a second language counterparts. I am sure if the roles were reversed, you would want to be extended the same courtesy. ;</string>
            <string>Ana make sure you get rid of all the back story that you can in the front of the book! Good luck, friend!;</string>
            <string>yes I felt that way also ...not only his looks but the manner in which he speaks!   fitting as our comic book superheros beckon back to ancient mythology of Gods and Superhumans...as well as being our modern fairy tales!;So curiously with our first assignment I realized there are audio recording for some of the stories for the Brother&apos;s Grimm.   I don&apos;t know if it is cheating or not but it has helped me immensely to listen to the books while in my car.   I do feel however that this is a &quot;shortcut&quot; and wanted to share with others, especially those who have English as a second language.   But I wanted to make sure this isn&apos;t considered &quot;cheating&quot; ourselves in anyway?http://www.worldoftales.com/fairy_tales/Grimm&apos;s_fairy_tales_audio.html ;That was exactly the topic of my essay - the art of deception is well rewarded in most of these tales ...though this is reflective of modern society as well.   Think of how many &quot;cheat&quot; in order to obtain fame and fortune without any real talent or hard work.   Thank you for confrimring my own observations.;It was helpful to hear the video course work, but sad that this wasn&apos;t available until after the assignment was turned in. At least having one video would have helped to shape our essays a bit better.   I feel i was lucky in that i touched upon topics which he did mention in the videos but felt a little dismayed as it would have enriched my writing a lot more...I guess i will chalk this up to my own personal knowledge in the end and not for a specific grade.;</string>
            <string>Amen - I felt the same - five words does not meet up with the minimum required for peer reviews.   Off hand comments disagreeing with the argument doesn&apos;t help either - this should be objective reviews.   ;I also only had four reviewers - two of which wrote very little in the sections to give any feedback.;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>missed the last assignment - was in hospital for respitory infection ...anyway to turn it in late????;Thanks Patricia - yes I finished the others - really loving this course...hope there are more lit courses up soon;</string>
            <string>Yes, to both.   This project is planned as a series of e-books, &quot;Hard Squared Science Fiction&quot;.   Each is written as a separate cooperative venture.   The first volume will be e-published shortly, after a long delay.   The second volume is now open with one story complete and has attracted a tentative commercial sponsor.Please let me know if this idea might fit you needs.;This is the essay I got to peer edit from someone:  &quot;Analyses of the beta research data set were designed to identify the  best items to comprise the 11 scales and then assess the reliability  and validity of the scales. The scales, again, are Structure (SR),  Diversity (DV), Recognition (RE), Autonomy (AT), Environment  (EN), Expression (EX), Teamwork (TW), Stability (SB), Balance  (BA), Career Growth (CG), and Compensation.  Structure: Having high expectations about structure means that  you want clear instructions regarding what to do, how to do it, and  what resources are available to you.  Diversity: Having high expectations about diversity means that  you want to work with people from a variety of backgrounds and/or  with varied points of view.  Recognition: Having high expectations about recognition means  that you want a work environment where good work is  acknowledged and rewarded.  Autonomy: Having high expectations about autonomy means that  you want to have the independence or freedom to make decisions  about how you will do your job.  Environment: Having high expectations about environment  means that you see a connection between the social and physical  work environment and your well-being.  Expression: Having high expectations about expression means  that you want a work environment that allows you to share your  opinions and feelings openly.  Teamwork: Having high expectations about teamwork means that  you expect collaboration to be a highly valued and commonly used  method for reaching work objectives.  Stability: Having high expectations about stability means that you  want job security and a work environment that remains relatively  unchanged.Balance: Having high expectations about balance means that you  have personal and professional goals and that you want others to  understand the importance of all of your commitments.  Career Growth: Having high expectations about career growth  means that you want to make progress toward your professional  goals.   2001 by Inscape Publishing, Inc.

            <string>I believe a major criteria was whether the work can be obtained for free on the internet. More popular giants like Asimov and Douglas Adams don&apos;t have their works available for free. Although Verne&apos;s works are available so I can&apos;t comment on that.  ;Anna, thanks for the tip. I&apos;ll be sure to use it.  ;thanks :);Here&apos;s what I got on this: ....On page 208, Van Helsing says this to Dr. Seward :     ...we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.   I think the &quot;little bit of truth&quot; and &quot;small truth&quot;   is science and &quot;big truth&quot;   and &quot;all the truth in the universe&quot; is religion. Acknowledge the truth of science but believe in the truth of religion.  He also says:  &quot;I want you to believe...to believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith,    that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.&quot;Here I think the word &quot;know&quot; refers to our scientific knowledge. By scientific knowledge, we &quot;know&quot; certain things to be untrue. But faith lets us believe these untrue things because faith does not require scientific knowledge.  Stoker obviously values science and see the importance of it. But he also seems heavily religious and stresses the importance of having faith. Both are true, but one is a bigger truth than the other; one encompasses the other.  ;I just thought of this and wondered if its valid or means anything.  Jesus was killed, he descended into Hell, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven.  Lucy was killed, she &quot;rose&quot; from the dead and became part of the undead which is like hell since eternal damnation and all that, and then she was saved by the holy wafer and probably went to heaven judging by the look of peace on her face.  Thoughts?;</string>
            <string>If you note the parallelisms to story in Genesis, then I think the answer is trickier than a simple &quot;yes&quot;.  God created Adam.  Dr. Frankenstein created his monster.  God saw that Adam was lonely and made him a bride, Eve.  With this alone, it seems easy to say that Victor should do likewise for his monster.  But here&apos;s the question: Is Dr. Frankenstein God? The answer is quite simply no.  Although Dr. Frankenstein created life in a pale imitation of God, he is not a God and will never be able to do what He does. God created a wife for Adam that loves him. God can make that guarantee of requited love while Dr. Frankenstein can not.  Like God, Dr. Frankenstein has responsibility over his creation. Unlike God, Dr. Frankenstein is unable to meet them.  When you pose the question of whether Dr. Frankenstein should create a female monster for his male monster you also pose the question:   Should Dr. Frankenstein dabble in playing God?  ;The monster is incredibly insightful at times and horrifically violent at others. Is the monster a product of his environment or was he &quot;born&quot; that way?  I really want to lean towards nurture from my take on the reading but what&apos;s yours?;There are people who, no matter how many hardships are thrust upon them, do the right thing. Is the monster&apos;s environment enough justification for his actions? Take for example victims of abuse and violence. Some can overcome that go on to lead fulfilling lives while others end up committing the same crime that affected them. There must be some intrinsic difference between these two types of victims.  I suppose the question is, which factor is stronger?;</string>
            <string>I always enjoyed sci-fi (Orson Scott Card was one of my favorite authors) but what really got me into the genre was Asimov&apos;s book &quot;Gold&quot; which had some of his stories, articles, and essays. From there, &quot;The Foundation Series&quot; and &quot;I, Robot&quot; hooked me for good. &quot;Gold&quot; made me appreciate how expansive and wonderful the genre is.  ;I believe it was compiled after his death. Basically, a celebration of his achievements.  ;George Orwell is great too. Jules Vernes work is also good but I found some of his works to be unbelievably slow (Journey to the Center of the Earth).  ;I got an essay that sort of muddled works from four different short stories from both authors. It was confusing to say the least.  ;</string>
            <string>I know that I try to get straight to the point with corrections (usually just list a common error and provide an example in the essay). I suppose that kind of blunt criticism could be perceived as rude. But I also offer praise in that blunt sort of way. Maybe I should just add a disclaimer to my evaluations...And I&apos;m completely understanding about foreign language students. My mom has me correct her work all the time so I can start to &quot;see&quot; how the person might have made that error, if their language is not English. I also noticed that Spanish speakers make almost the same errors in English that I make when writing in Spanish; which is very fascinating when you think about it.  ;I had the great luck of losing internet connection all day today. I completed the evaluations 20 minutes after the deadline passed. It says I finished and ticked me off as having completed the assignment. But..what? Will I be penalized? The system didn&apos;t say anything about my late evaluation.  ;Thanks :);You should probably cite them.  ;</string>
            <string>Well, I write more fantasy, but I have written two short stories that are science fiction crossed with other genres. I would, however, love to be a part of a study group, though my time is limited for the next few weeks (until school is out). Nice to meet you all and looking forward to studying and discussing writing with you!;I prefer the likes of Terry Pratchett (Discworld) and Robert Asprin (Phule&apos;s Company and the MYTH-series) for their fantasy satire.   As for more serious,  John Steakley (Armor) was good, but now gone.   Ray Bradbury and Robert Heinlein are always good, classic go-to sources as well.;  Qu   alegre! Ya somos unos cuantos :);Thanks for this interesting link!Liliane;Good advice.;Oh yeah. love Adventure Time in all its weirdness.;</string>
            <string>Lol! Thank you good sir!  Dark Crystal I&apos;ve been told about but I can&apos;t find it along with Legend.  ;ASOFAI is a great series of books, it is a sort of analogy of the period after the fall of the roman empire (old Valyria) and the rising feuds becoming kingdoms in constant struggle to be united or separated, all revolving around a recent religius expansionism, mixed with magic and of course dragons. The morally ambigous characters are the basic aspect of why the show and the book are so likeable, we can relate to them and their issues, to redifine the moral code deciding by particular situations make fantasy so much richer than having predictable characters, (the pov formula helps here, because not having a god perspective leaves a lot of character and plots in the dark)It is kind of a love/hate relationship with waiting for the 6th book (as neil gaiman said GRRM is not our bitch lol), its kind of awesome to have a series in the making but the waiting sucks.this girl has some nice videos explaining some of the houses:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnfYj-cHM5c    ;Tyrion and Arya are one of my favorites, they are always involved in intriguing scenarios.right now some of the most interesting arcs are the one involving Sansa, Jon, and Theon.;I don&apos;t know what I expected...;1. Robots of Dawn Isaac Asimov2. The Historian Elizabet Kostova3. World War z Max Brooks  4. Last Chance to See Douglas Adams (not actually fantasy or sci fi but really fun to read)5.  Foucault&apos;s Pendulum Umberto Ecothis books are some of the most entertainig stories I have read.;We are supposed to read all the stories and while we read we can focus on a single story, a recurring topic throughtout the collection, or the style the storyteller use, the main idea is to get a clear thesis avaible to a fellow reader, and that may be done either way.  Thats what I understood from the video and the example we got on a fable.  ;Zen and the art of Writing by Ray BradburySeminar 1 Jaques LacanThe Currents of Space Isaac Asimovand the Grim brother tales, I  ll make sure to take note on some of the stuff you are reading for the future.;I think it really is becoming rarer and rarer to see fairy tales in the traditional way, but some comics and manga have found a new way of making them, and we may find &quot;grim&quot; stories with supernatural beings like death note and some more positive stories, but with the ongoing plots on the comics the task is more as seeing the same characters involve themselves in different shenanigangs monthly, all based on the illustrated way of storytelling.some of the stuff Neil Gaiman does could be considered modern fairytale like, specially some of the sandman comics (some in with to win you first must make a sacriice).  ;but of course he is, Orwell wrote a manual on how to stalk and control masseshave you tried double thinking? don  t it  s illegal...;H.P. Lovecraft and Doctorow, lol not what I was expecting.;</string>
            <string>my native language is spanish, I try to do my best writing in english but of course, sometimes my spelling and my grammar (and my pronunciation when speaking) are not the best around, but knowing that I spellcheck more often and do re reads of my essays.  I got an Issue with a person with some issues in grammar and spelling so I commented on it in a constructive and honest way, we know we can improve (non native speakers), and we appreciate direct and thorough analysis and comments.bottom line is, just don  t be mean, help other people improve, specify the problem,  Its way better to get a &quot;you mispelled this or that and can check this&quot; than &quot;dude your writing sucks&quot;.;Indeed, this is way better than what I expected.;Vampires sagas experienced a boom in recent years, movies like Daybreakers and series like trueblood even gave it the edge of being based on a perhaps dystopian world with vampires running the cities, but some of the best stories I have seen or read are The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova and the anime Shiki.  ;  reincarnation of the dragon prince Throgdor, destructor of towns and terror of maidens  ;</string>
            <string>ok, I&apos;m not gonna stand this &quot;tom&quot; guy and his rant against the Almighty...KEYBOARD CAT!!!!!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ulyJuvU3Qnow in all seriusness, (i was joking Mr. Tom)  Asimov said the next thing that will unite humanity would be a solar energy  harvesting enterprise, perhaps it will get here soon...;We have only read fantasy until now, I guess that appeals to the human mind part of the title, perhaps with Frankeintsein, The Island of Dr. Moreau and further sci fi books we will see in the video lectures an approach referring to our modern world. On the 5 evaluations, I&apos;m ok with them, some of the essays are worth the effort.   ;Vampire myths are typically slavic but popular through out the world, caribbean cultures have their own, some say based on African ancient religions, in one of them they believe a dead witch becomes vampiric, and the way to stop her is to leave a broom or spilled beans, because she can&apos;t advance if she does not count them or the straws on the broom, so when she is done the sun has rised...it is curious how this developed, could be convergent evolution or one &quot;original&quot; religion or culture...;of course they are taboo topics, but that doesn&apos;t mean you can review the essays leaving your prejudice behind.I have reviewed some essays since week 1 that may have dealt with difficult topics in general (some views I didn&apos;t agree on), but it wasn&apos;t my duty nor my interest to question this persons ideas or beliefs, it (our job as reviewers) was (is) just to see if their writing met certain criteria which is clearly laid out in different sections of this course. I don&apos;t think you have to worry about your essay being evaluated by prejudiced people, in any case those persons will be the ones at loss, since apparently they didn&apos;t understand what reviewing in this place is about.in fact the more this kind of works get into other people eyes, the best it is for all of us to keep an open mind to different cultures and ideas.     ;</string>
            <string>lol there you go...it maybe was because you kind of went off topic taking about pronunciation and not the origin of the word... I guess your great aunt is fine...  I don&apos;t really hear him pronounce it so differently.(mee - nah, my - nah, meh - nah?)  ;your opinion should be your thesis, therefore it should be well sustented by aspects of the story that are relevant to those arguments.I don&apos;t know about casual essays since ours aren&apos;t scientifical papers either, but an in between maybe? your opinion sustented on aspects of the book and some other source to give authority to your thoughts?  anyway, considering our peers for each week may never repeat I don&apos;t think you should give much thought to this, and focus on clear and significant feedback.;The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell which was also a tv show (some videos might appear on youtube) and The Heroe of a Thousand Faces by the same author.Carl Jung has a lot of books that talk about myth like &quot;The Archetypes and the Collective Unconcius&quot; and    &quot;Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies&quot;;I said in some place else and in my essay that Shelley wrote very complex characters that may not be what we expect, they are not precisely heroes or anti heroes, I actually enjoy the fact that these characters are deep and flawed, almost unrelateable...;I think it was done on purpose to generate that sense of tediusness in the readerA work of art transmits feelings, they can be awful ones sometimes but the point is to make you feel, and as victor and his creation, the novel can transmit nasty feelings...it depends on the reader of course, but I think this is the third topic talking about something in Shelleys style that is not quite what we expect on a novel so universally known, even considered a classic.  ;it really seems that way...waiting for the pre recorded holograph to appear week after week and listen to the lectures from the past...;hahahayeah it (he or she?) looks nice, I first was not sure if it was real or decoration but then I saw it moving...;awesome!google had me at pac - man but I keep checking their home page (I use chrome, so I google directly from the browser) every now and then to see doodles and animations  ;</string>
            <string>I told to one of the authors of an essay I reviewed that his or her thesis lacked depth not because the theme or topic was not intellectually challenging, but because he drifted to much on another stuff and did not focus his or her work on the main thesis he or she proposed  An essay is about producing &quot;new&quot; knowledge so no one can accuse someone of not writing about what they want (freud or christianity for example as anonymous said) but we can recommend our peers to make the effort of stating a well developed thesis in 320 words.we all can get better working together, and it would be nice to have a chat with the reviewers, perhpas coursera helps us if this idea get enopugh support;I was thinking the exact same thing! my blog is also on wordpress (http://nowintechnicolors.wordpress.com/) and I will post them eventually;thanks!

            <string>I guess it depends, to say this is true I would have to review the current essays of the people I reviewed on week 1, 2 or 3  At least in the evaluation part I do feel some things are not clear enough eventhough we are 6 weeks into this...   some peers don&apos;t get the idea that we are not supposed to question other authors views or framework, but the essays coherence, interanl logic and its relation to the readings, therefore I don&apos;t struggle to come up with a great essay (as I struggled in week 2 just to get called a joke because they didn&apos;t agree with me)...so anyway, I don&apos;t think I can say for certain essays have improved, in my case I gave a 6 in week 1 and have not found anyone else with that quality  ;formal essays require a title but considering the word limit I rather not...btw, I leave the titles till the end (after writing the full essay I choose a title) it seems easier...;Well in regard to the lecture, I think Prof. Rabkin dismisses that Oedipal structures besides the sucession of power have a very important element: this structures need 3 components, (Oedious, Laius, Jocasta)  Oedipus legitimates his power when he marries THE queen, so if we say that Pendrick becomes a man by taking something from Moreau like the island, beasts or science (those things would play the place of Jocasta) it could be.disregarding the third element transforms any Oedipal structure into simple heritage problems that can be seen in a lot of stories previus to Oedipus Rex.  ;you need to get a 4 on 7 essays (or a 3.6 average) to get the certificate, you can miss 3 essays if you get good marks on the rest.only your higest marked essays are considered.  ;</string>
            <string>I write   sff and would like to   spend time with other writers doing the course. Tom, the project sounds fascinating.;I don&apos;t know that my taste in Fantasy is particularly mature but, I love anything by Anne McCaffery, J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis. I&apos;m a busy mom so books I can read to my children such as The Hobbit and The Chronicles of Narnia get extra points. As far as sci-fi goes, I love Peter F. Hamilton. He&apos;s dark but really drags you into a story.;I liked &quot;The Raven&quot;, where the girl is determined this dude is going to be her hero, and gives him like a million chances to save her!   There&apos;s no way of knowing exactly how old these stories are, or how the original story actually went.   I think it&apos;s interesting--were these stories considered fashionable or innovative or risque when they were originally told?   When the Grimms collected these stories, were they considered old news?   It&apos;s also interesting to ponder what changes may have occurred....perhaps the &quot;needle&quot; and other inanimate objects were actually meant to portray certain people the storyteller knew?;Great question for discussion.   I am enjoying the answers, thoughts and thinking on this.   But I think nothing is set in stone, that the definitions for the fantasy genre are like the definitions of poetry that one adheres to which says more about the values, aestetics, culture, education and even time period (and a myriad of other factors) in which the poet is writing than it does about the absolute properties of the what poetry is, or can be.;Being concerned about the issue myself, I will avidly await the answer along with you. Having said that, I won&apos;t allow it to influence my decision to try and take everything I can out of the course. Of course, not every critique is helpful - as an aspiring writer who participates in online writing groups I know that all too well - but not venturing out there to see if maybe something constructive comes my way too seems even less productive.Not trying to persuade, just my opinion;I assumed that the essays are graded independently by staff at the university and that we are only grading them as an exercise to give us practice at critically evaluating people&apos;s responses to the texts. It would seem odd if the final grade was influenced by the feedback that students would give other students and that this is used to measure our participation in the course and it is taken into consideration for the final grade in that way. I don&apos;t consider myself qualified to &quot;mark&quot; other people&apos;s work in a way that contribute to their final grade so I can&apos;t see the grades we give other students to be part of it. It would be better if it was clarified though to avoid confusion. ;Katrina, I understand your issue with the grading and I respect your issues with it. This situation reminds me of an issue I&apos;ve had in my own courses when trying (forcing?) students to understand the benefits of peer review. The ideal is that students, when acting as reviewers, learn to become better critics of ideas and their own writing by having something more tangible than participation points at stake. When my students felt they were being held accountable by other students for their own grades and were accountable for the grades they gave others, they handled peer review with a new sense of seriousness and purpose. Further, my students reported that it made them feel like they were actually contributing to knowledge both on content and form by helping their peers. They began to see themselves as part of a scholarly community Instead of feeling like high schoolers being given inane tasks to complete. It helped them refine their scholarly voices and gain security in the fact that they could (and needed to!) provide thought-provoking and critical analysis to their peers - a skill necessary both in the classroom, on blog posts/forums, and in the greater community while in the workplace or over a beer. I&apos;ve interpreted Prof. Rabkin&apos;s grading criteria in light of these experiences in my own classroom. It&apos;s not the most ideal situation to base a course &quot;grade&quot; on only peer-reviewed material, but I think it helps develop the scholarly community he&apos;s aiming for given the skills he wants us to have at the end of the course. With your Mythology course, I wonder what would stop a &quot;robot&quot; to be built that fills in all the blanks with Lorem Ipsum instead of a real, flesh student writing critically on the assigned materials? While there could be a system implemented where reviewers &quot;flag&quot; posts like that, if I, as a student, saw multiple ones like that in the span of the course, I&apos;d start questioning the legitimacy of the course and Coursera as a medium. (not to say I&apos;ve seen this happen, but just to pose a hypothetical). I look forward to your thoughts on this as a fellow educator!;As a fellow teacher, encouraging students to take this course, that is also my take Danielle. Professor explained very well what was required and how it will improve the skill set of all students taking this course.  ;Yeah, I think you are raising a fair point, Katrina. I had similar concerns (along the lines of &quot;would students know what they&apos;re doing?&quot;) the first time I came across it here on Coursera, but so far I have nothing but good experiences with it. A professor in another course said that after looking through the results from a previous version of his course, it turned out that students mark each other very similarly to what he himself would have done.This being said, you, or anyone else, should certainly bring it up again if the feedback you&apos;re getting is unfair. :);(N.B. I am not a teacher nor a professional of any stripe - below are just my personal experiences.)I too was concerned about peer review when I first found coursera. It makes practical sense to use it, thanks to the huge enrollment numbers, and I&apos;m sure in the aggregate, the peer review grades average out to something fair.In the previous class I&apos;ve taken (Dr. Hagen&apos;s fantastic AIDS course) I found that my final grade accurately reflected my work as a whole. That said, there were a few essays where the peer reviewers took off points, and then could not comment coherently as to why.  In the case of one particular essay, it was obvious that my word choices had outstripped the knowledge of three different non-native English speakers; all three left comments that demonstrated they either hadn&apos;t read, or hadn&apos;t understood my essay. I felt bad about the misunderstanding; I respect anyone who has the drive to take a class in a second (third, fourth, etc) language! But at the same time, I was upset about essentially being &quot;punished&quot; for delving into the topic in greater depth. I found myself writing with very simple language and striving to make my points blatantly obvious (and not in a good way - things like literally writing &quot;The first statement significant to me is.... the second statement significant to me is....&quot;) for the rest of the course, so as to not find myself penalized due to a peer&apos;s difficulties in reading English.Even with that, one person whose English was perfect docked a later essay for &quot;not having a thesis or conclusion.&quot; Fair enough, except, since this was after I&apos;d already decided to break out the sledgehammer and abandon all subtleties, the essay in question included blinking neon signs in the form of that awful phrase, &quot;I will argue that A, B, C&quot; and the close second in terms of pedestrian tell-not-showing phrases, &quot;In conclusion...&quot;I just might have had to walk away from the computer for several minutes the afternoon that review came back. And count to a hundred. And remind myself I was still going to get a very good grade, so it didn&apos;t matter much. But arrrrgh.But the grading system as a whole is not going to change, because it can&apos;t practicably use professors and TAs to grade however many thousand essays are at stake.Some advice, therefore, for my fellow peer reviewers, especially those whose written English skills are not very strong (you can be a native English speaker and still have difficulty with the written word - ask anyone who&apos;s dyslexic!):Read slowly and carefully.Read the whole essay. Then read it a second time. Make sure you understand what the writer is trying to say. (There was a lot of whining in the AIDS class that people just didn&apos;t have *time* to read *so many* (5) essays! I&apos;m sympathetic to that, but if you don&apos;t have the time to evaluate your peers *carefully* - as carefully as you yourself would hope to be graded - then please, don&apos;t participate in the essay portion of the class.)If you don&apos;t understand what the writer is trying to say, ask yourself whether they are writing unclearly, or whether your reading comprehension might be the issue. If you are a non-native speaker, dyslexic, if you&apos;re *grading* someone who might be a non-native English speaker or dyslexic, or if you&apos;re in a rush despite yourself, you owe it to your classmates to be *especially* careful to make sure you haven&apos;t missed something. If a writer uses a word you don&apos;t know, look it up. If that sheds no light, ask on the boards... many people will be happy to help. Yo no hablo espa  ol bien en estos d _as, pero puedo leer lo suficientemente bien como para ayudar a los estudiantes que necesitan un poco de ayuda de la traducci _n. (hopefully I have conjugated that *mostly* correctly or my tio will be very disappointed with me! :) )By all means, critique - that is the point of this class, for learning cannot take place without criticism. But make sure it&apos;s &quot;attentive, intelligent&quot; criticism, to borrow from Prof. Rabkin. &quot;I didn&apos;t like this&quot; or &quot;you didn&apos;t do this well&quot; aren&apos;t helpful. &quot;I found the middle of your essay confusing because A doesn&apos;t seem to have much to do with B&quot; is a helpful comment. The same applies to &quot;good&quot;... not helpful. &quot;I liked what you said about food meanings, it made me see the text in a different way.&quot; That&apos;s helpful. You don&apos;t have to write a long or complicated comment to be helpful, just say something interesting. If you are a non-native speaker who finds commenting difficult in English, by all means, type your comment into google translate and paste the English translation into the comment box. I would rather get a very thoughtful comment in computer-translated English than a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;not good&quot; from a self conscious reviewer.And finally, just to reiterate, I have *profound* respect for the non-native English speakers taking this course. I could not take a course in Spanish or Irish (my two other languages) at this level and follow along. I also want to acknowledge that there are plenty of non-native English speakers out there whose English skills are better than mine - I tip my hat to you, too.If we all respect each other and do our best work (with reviewing as well as writing), everything will work out fine.;Katrina,I fully understand your reservations, believe me! I still share them - that&apos;s why I would *never* sign up for the signature track (which involves paying a significant amount of money to take the same class and have your grade considered certified and accredited) for a class like this. I simply don&apos;t trust the peer review system that much! I was just taking the opportunity on a thread about peer reviewing to elaborate on how those of us who *will* be participating in the peer review portion can do our best to be fair and informed toward our classmates. I completely respect your decision, and I wish there were easier ways for MOOCs like Coursera to deal with graded essays. I&apos;m embarrassed to admit it, but I don&apos;t think I would put nearly as much effort into a &quot;participation only&quot; essay as a graded one - in a classroom, as part of a for-credit course, I would, but for a free course that isn&apos;t for any credit, I would struggle to feel like the work I put in *meant* something if all I got at the end was a &quot;yeah, you typed something in the box.&quot;I suspect that a peer review system is the best out of a bunch of not-great options for Coursera as a whole. Individual Coursera classes might have better options to fit that specific material - for example, in the AIDS class, we discussed the possibility of making a &quot;dual track&quot; available - one for people who didn&apos;t want to write essays/didn&apos;t feel comfortable with peer review, and one for people who wanted to write essays and/or didn&apos;t feel comfortable with quizzes being their only coursework. One of my other classes is quizzes only, and for that material, it works fine. Peer review that doesn&apos;t actually count for a grade would demotivate *me*, but that doesn&apos;t make it an invalid option. And so on.I certainly didn&apos;t feel like you were trying to tell the professor how to run his class. I&apos;ve witnessed people *actually* doing that, and those people have never been as polite as you are. In addition to that, I&apos;ve known a lot of educators in my life (my mother is a school bus driver and I&apos;ve worked as an informal paraprofessional in special ed classrooms off and on for many years, as our district is chronically shorthanded in that area), and I know no educator who would think of doing such a thing!So, no worries. Your point of view is well taken and was well expressed. Don&apos;t worry about the rude commenters - such is the way of the internet. Enjoy the class!;One of Vertigo&apos;s tamer series and I still love it. Personally Jack of Fables is my favourite, his personality straddles the line between the darker and lighter side of fairy tales.  ;I&apos;ve read a bunch of them, and really love them. Along with Sondheim&apos;s Into the Woods, Fables is among my favorite &quot;fractured fairy tales.&quot;I just recently mentioned them on my blog.  http://stackedshelves.blogspot.com/2013_04_01_archive.html;I used to read them, I guess I read until issue number 80 or so. It&apos;s a wonderful comic series but very hard to find in Mexico.  ;I Katrina. What I&apos;d like to know is what stories do we have to read for next week....there&apos;s a LOT of them.I used that website to learn Danish, you can have the same tale written in two different language one besides the other, so you can compare them.By the way, I remember your name, but I am not sure from which course...Greek Mythology?;I see that we&apos;ve got a GoodReads group, so I created one for LibraryThing too:http://www.librarything.com/groups/fantasyandscienceficAnd here&apos;s my (woefully incomplete) profile there:http://www.librarything.com/profile/nadyne.richmond;Hello, here goes my (rather incomplete) list:Movies (in no particular order):  -SF:MatrixAnimatrixAvalonDonnie DarkoAkira12 Monkeys  -Fantasy:Spirited Away.Princess Mononoke.Nausicaa.Howl&apos;s Moving Castle.LOTR The two towers.About TV series I think I do not know a lot but as more people bring them up, I&apos;ll remember them. Neon Genesis Evangelion would be there, as well as Last Exile and Gundam Wing. Game of Thrones would also appear on my list.;I haven&apos;t read the book (which I hope to find soon), butI particularly like what Studo Ghibli does, although anime as a general rule is not what I most like, I saw a fair share some years ago, but it gets repetitive quickly, except for Ghibli&apos;s productions.I never saw Firefly, I could only get the movie, Serenity, which I enjoyed. About the Neverending Story... I&apos;m such a shame hehe I have never watched it.Regarding books, have you read anything within Orson Scott Card&apos;s Enderverse? I&apos;m looking forward to Ender&apos;s Game movie this year.;Carolyn, On a side note, I noticed that you have Blade Runner on your list and thought worth mentioning that the movie was loosely based on a novel called &apos;Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep&apos; by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote another book called &apos;A Scanner Darkly&apos; witch was made into a moderately successful animated movie.;For anime, try Samurai Champloo if you&apos;ve not seen it. And I&apos;ll always love Avatar: The Last Airbender (the cartoon, NOT the awful movie). That was a quality show. ;You should totally watch Doctor Who. You can start with the new stuff (Christopher Eccleston), no need to go back to the very first season if you don&apos;t want to. It&apos;s really good. ;To me, It always felt a bit incomplete.;I also love Game of Thrones, read all the books (currently written at the time) and then reread them when the HBO show came out (by the way, I&apos;m so happy with this show: it is one of the better, if not the best, adaptations I&apos;ve seen).I think all of your comments are really well made. The characterization is amazing for me, brought to life because of how Martin writes the narrative. The story is like a game of Risk, where certain &quot;colors&quot; or families win some, then lose some, with each consecutive roll of the dice, but they all have the same goal. I, of course, love all of the core characters, but there are many minor characters that I wish Martin would have latched on to and written in as one of the narrative characters because I want to learn so much more about them.;</string>
            <string>I agree with Katrina.Folktales are often not the most moral and decent stuff to read/listen. Especially those which are older. I like Grimm&apos;s stories and folktales in general: they are amusing, there is implicit wisdom in them, but they are too contradictory to be a guide. You should already have some views upon the world to discriminate between right and wrong.I appreciate folktales but prefer authored stories. I like to meet a personal position. And I&apos;m too modern: I need a logically consistent plot. :D;This is interesting. I also had the thought that perhaps the step-mother is often wicked/evil in these stories because divorce was not as common as it is in certain areas of the world today, so a step-mother often meant that your biological mother was dead. This may add an extra layer to the reason for not-so-nice step-mothers, a further psychological aspect. In some of the stories this is explicitly stated - Aschenputtel&apos;s mother is dead, for instance. She goes to visit her grave every day and she also plants the hazel-stick there. I am wondering, in other tales where there is a step-mother but it is not explicitly mentioned that the biological mother has died, if this was just assumed. Today, it is not uncommon to see families with single parents and/or step-parents from divorce. Back then, in Germany and other areas where these tales were prominent, my bet is that a step-parent only comes into the picture by a widow re-marrying (after the death of the first parent).  ;also don&apos;t be too concerned, you need a 1,8 average on your best assignments.If you submit anything, you&apos;ll get a minimum of 2... so the peer evaluations are really there for you to learn from and not to determine who passes the course.(i think that&apos;s correct - feel free to correct me on my math) :P;Katrina,I totally understand your point.   After reading some of the fb comments for this course from a previous class, I am even more concerned about being graded solely on peer reviews.   Comments (assumptions) were made about whether the writer was a native english speaker, differences in grammar/punctuation correction in each essay (this is incorrect, then they would change it to the recommended correctness, and that would be incorrect), to being graded down for taking a point that differed from the book (most common example was in Frankenstein when choosing the creator as the real monster).   Many in this class do not have any *real* instruction in grading, reviewing, etc. as most are not teachers, or going to school to become a teacher.   We also will run into the problem of *opinion* and we all know the saying about that.   It doesn&apos;t seem equitable that our grade is figured from the peer reviews themselves.   It is also ambiguous because the instructor states in the video that if you do all 10 essays you will have an A.   Not true because if you score low on the essays you will not.   Especially since &quot;rarely&quot; should there be a 3, which would, imho, classify as an A.   2, imho, would revert to a B/C, and a 1 an F.   I would more think that since this a pass/fail (which does not mean that we should &quot;chill&quot; and not be concerned about grades...yes, we are doing this for our enrichment, but many of us still care deeply about the grade)that doing the assignments appropriately and turning them all in, doing your peer reviews, etc should garner your grade, not the reviews themselves.;Thanks, Katrina. That&apos;s nice of you to say.;Fables is amazing.   Also interesting to note that the fables in this incarnation retain their power to some extent by force of belief,   This goes right with the reading of Grimm and why they remain so prominent.   It is not just that the stories are that good, but that since so many have heard them, they gain force by shear prevalence.   (Which is also the theme of another comic/graphic novel, Unwritten.);What bums me out is when I try to introduce people to those particular comics and I&apos;m written off because comics are just Superheroes right? Gah. Comics and Graphic Novels are a legit literary genre, in my opinion. Most comics aren&apos;t really meant for children. If I had a child, I wouldn&apos;t let them read some of the things I&apos;ve picked up until they were a bit older.  ;Exactly.  People who think comics are for children just do not know.  Maus and Watcmen both garnered their creators Pulitzers.  It is inventive literature.  Some of the most forward thinking writing is in graphic format.  McLuhan is wrong.  Media is not the message.   ;I&apos;m with you, Katrina!   The Black Cauldron was one of the rare movies I saw multiple times in the theater and it led me to check out The Prydain Chronicles from the school library to get Taran&apos;s whole story.   This was when they were still in individual books.   I later bought the compilation from The Science Fiction Book Club some years later.Titan A.E. is one of my favorite animated movies as well.   Don Bluth animated the game Dragon&apos;s Lair (and others) and I like his style.   The story is fairly cliche, but not overly so.   The bleak human future is an unpopular setting to many because it&apos;s &quot;our team&quot; that&apos;s losing.   I can see how the common mind would chafe on that.   I like the &quot;overcoming adversity&quot; stories.   The worse the conditions, the sweeter the victory.One final observation:   Both of those movies do well with me because neither of them were made with any &quot;sing along&quot; songs.   Name another Disney animated movie that doesn&apos;t have any songs in it.   I can&apos;t think of any.   Yes Titan A.E. had some rockin&apos; soundtracks, but the characters weren&apos;t yippy-skippying about vocalizing their feelings in harmony.   Yeesh.;It&apos;s really iteresting to see the similarities between fairy tales in different times and places, definitely what one could call &quot;collective consciousness&quot;, this also works for myths and legends.;Tyrion is my favorite. Who doesn&apos;t love him? But I also really like Jorah and Daenerys both. I&apos;m not too fond of any of the Stark kids, but I did love Ned Stark.;Besides Grimm, Dracula, and Oedipus for another course, I&apos;m reading The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama by Lord Raglan, and I&apos;m rereading Isabel Allende&apos;s House of the Spirits because I want to propose a unit plan to teach that book next year.;Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales!! At least, for starters....Who&apos;s up first? Little Red Riding Hood!Source:   http://mathieubeaulieu.deviantart.com/art/Wolves-Bus-ride-9906903Even though it&apos;s meant to be an amusing cartoon (which it is!) I love how it can symbolize the timeless quality of the tales as well as the modern &apos;fad&apos; to rework them.....Source:http://dmitrygrebenkov.deviantart.com/art/Indian-Red-Riding-Hood-327610034And this one is a stunning example of the cross-cultural appeal and universality.Up next: Splat! Or, The Frog KingSource:  http://www.etsy.com/listing/100228410/the-frog-king-aceo?ref=shop_home_activeJust for fun to illustrate a great discussion going on here...Do any of you have some art you love inspired by the Grimms? Or maybe some Sci-Fi/Fantasy art in general....?;Yay! I love those illustrations. The second one is, I believe, by Kay Nielsen.Her Rumpelstiltskin is very popular:Kay Nielsen:  http://50watts.com/Golden-Age-Illustrator-Kay-NielsenAnother great illustrator of the tales: Warwick Goble. Here&apos;s one of Snow White:;I understand all of the points brought up...but what is the alternative? Censorship? We&apos;ve come so far in this area, I do not want to go backwards. It&apos;s wrong to think that an issue will go away just by avoiding it. I mean, ignorance may really be bliss, but I&apos;d rather be knowledgable.  Please remember that most of us on this course are adults or if not, we&apos;re mature enough to know not to go around repeating offensive words or actions just because we read them in a book. If it really bothers you that much, try to keep in mind that they are fantasy and sci-fi works. Yes, they may include reflections of real society and ways of life, but if you don&apos;t want to focus on that in order to feel less &apos;uncomfortable&apos; you can opt not to.;The children were the prince&apos;s. In my version Maria Tatar wrote:  Rapunzel becomes a &quot;wife&quot; because the Grimms did not want to suggest that Rapunzel&apos;s twins were born out of wedlock.She is referring to the passage where the witch says to the prince: &quot;You want to come get your darling little wife, but the beautiful bird is no longer sitting in the nest, singing her songs.&quot;;The version I have is The Annotated Brothers Grimm:http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Brothers-Grimm-Bicentennial-Edition/dp/0393088863/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...;See, I read this in a different way. To me, the witch or enchantress had purposely put the delicious looking rapunzel in the garden so that the woman would see it and crave it. Perhaps she even put a spell on the rapunzel because it had such a powerful impact on the woman: &quot;she began to waste away because she was afraid she would never get any of it.&quot; Since the woman had just gotten pregnant, I felt that the witch (who is also called a fairy in some other versions) was playing on the cravings that pregnant women might get and purposely making the rapunzel look so appetizing, and then, of course, making it taste so good.;I love how there are so many different interpretations to these tales. It makes for some interesting and insightful conversations.  Peter: You may think that the witch was not cruel to Rapunzel, but how much more cruel can you be locking a child up in a tower? That&apos;s imprisonment! For doing absolutely nothing; her freedom is taken from her for the sins of her parents. There is a prison in Philadelphia called the Eastern State Penitentiary in which prisoners were kept in solitary confinement so as to reflect on their sins and hopefully, repent. In reality, many of them went insane because of the lack of human contact. The prison reformed a number of times over the years and finally shut down in the 1970s. John Graham also brought up a great point about real children being raised in captivity. It is horrible, and if you ask me, the witch got off too easy for doing that to Rapunzel in the first place.  There are many different versions of the story of Medusa, too, but it&apos;s interesting that you brought her up. One version said that she boasted about her beauty too much so Athena punished her vanity by taking that beauty away. Another version said that she seduced Poseidon in Athena&apos;s temple, and finally there&apos;s the version that she was raped in Athena&apos;s temple; either way she was turned into a gorgon by Athena. With this story, it is often argued that had Medusa not been in the temple, the punishment would have been a lot less severe (if there was a punishment at all). Athena was not angry about the coupling, she was angry that it happened in her temple (being a virgin goddess and all). One of the main warnings in this myth is to not defile sacred sites...which differs somewhat from Rapunzel, but I do see the connection. Good thinking.;Peter,You are right about that particular rape victim version of the story, but that is not one of the older versions of Medusa. It is actually one of the new versions, coming with Ovid. Sorry to correct you on this, but I did a report on Medusa so I have studied her a lot.   : /    Actually, the oldest version of Medusa&apos;s name having showed up is one in which she was never human, but a sister of Stheno and Euryale, one of the daughters of Phorcys and Keto/Ceto. Medusa was the only mortal one in the trio, and thus, able to be killed by Perseus. Again, as with all Greek myths, there are many variations, more than I have described.  I do see what you mean about a protected treasure, but that is just what I am trying to point out. By &apos;protecting&apos; a child from the world, it&apos;s like you&apos;re treating her as a piece of property, hoarding an object, like Gollum with his precious ring. That is a very sinister thing to do to a human being. Not only would you stunt the mind of a child, but probably the health and growth by locking them away in such a manner. If you don&apos;t doom them outright to insanity, as I said earlier. How is that okay? How will a child raised in such a way ever be able to function in the real world? How much have they missed being shut away their whole life? It&apos;s almost on par with abortion.;L. Frank Baum and Mark Twain from posting some of my children&apos;s writing. Love both, so I&apos;m happy.;</string>
            <string>Anonymous,I think that was the Professor&apos;s point: the Grimms sought out to collect and write down these tales as a way to bring their people together...to make a nation. They wanted to foster a sense of unity. I don&apos;t think the Professor was harsh at all. It is only because you know about Nazi Germany that you&apos;re looking back at that way. But if the Professor said the same things and the Nazis had never come to power, you would not be thinking along these lines.And yeah, there were tons of countries at this time, before, and after that also wanted nationalism for their country.  ;You must read the annotated version if you do not think that Alice is absolutely brilliant (and a whole heck of a lot of fun to boot)! Martin Gardner, in the Introduction to my annotated book writes: &quot;The fact is that Carroll&apos;s nonsense is not nearly as random and pointless as it seems to a modern American child who tries to read the Alice books.&quot; There are many, MANY inside jokes that we don&apos;t get as readers from a different time, culture, and even academic level. Carroll was most certainly an interesting fellow, for a variety of reasons, but one thing is certain: he &quot;was a skilled storyteller.&quot; The numerous interpretations, studies, analyses, and general interest in his work by thousands of people prove that, if nothing else.;Suzanne,I think you should really take what most people are saying on here into consideration. I am curious as to what other classic literature you have read. Have you read any Shakespeare? Steinbeck? Jonathan Swift? How about any of the Arabian tales? Greek, Egyptian, or Norse myths? Chinese myths? One could argue that a lot of the timeless literature is riddled with violence; much more than you see in the fairy tales.I have read every book or story that is required for this course except for Herland. And, everyone else above is absolutely right. These tales are tame compared to some of what we will be delving into. If you are outraged now, you will blow your top soon. I respect your feelings, but urge you that if you are not yet ready to study these works seriously despite all of the violence, you might want to reconsider taking this course when and if you are.As for me, I am more outraged when I turn on the news than at any other time. Perhaps our own contemporary world would be less violent today if it could learn from the past violence in history and even in fictional literature.On a lighter note (and hopefully to make you laugh a little) I read and loved the Grimm fairy tales, as well as Andersen&apos;s tales, too, when I was a child. And they were not the watered down versions, but from an old series of my grandmothers (not sure if it was Lucy Crane or not). I never had any nightmares about them that I recall. You want to know what terrified me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I had a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh bear that I slept with (and still do, but shhh, don&apos;t tell anyone) and I dreamed that the Turtles kidnapped me and Pooh and hid him in a hole somewhere in the sewer. I still can remember vividly the horrifying experience of my dream where I was running through the sewer looking for Pooh, trying to be quiet and not scream when I stepped on rats as big as Splinter so that I didn&apos;t alert the Turtles. Go ahead and laugh at this, or at least smile, but that dream really did scare me half to death when I was younger.;This letterplay is straight from my annotated version: Notice the number of letters in each name, and the two double consonant sets (and where they are placed) in the surnames.Alice LiddellLewis CarrollAlso, Dear Lewis Carroll have the initials DLC which are CLD backwards, the initials for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Fun!;Most of the times, I would prefer the books. Poor Alan Moore&apos;s incredible works were made into awful movies. I was so sad that Stardust by Neil Gaiman was not such a great movie either (I would have loved it if they made an animated movie in de Lint style).  Sometimes, though, I can really enjoy both the movies and the books, separately and as variations of each other. For instance, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (so far) are really well done in film form, but there is a lot that is missing from the books (understandably) so I can enjoy both as separate works of art and know that one was inspired by the other. Another example, though a show, is HBO&apos;s Game of Thrones.  I was a collector of Spider-Man comics as a young girl and I was thrilled to see the first movie and how it was reinvented, though inspired, by the original story line.  I have yet to see Gatsby, though I am the only English teacher you will probably meet who doesn&apos;t enjoy this book in the first place....and I, too, am nervous about Ender&apos;s Game.;My cousin is a dancer and was just in a professional ballet production of Dracula. It was really stunning and sinister and spooky. I loved every minute of it. Although I despise Twilight and the many imitations, the original Dracula book is very intriguing and entertaining to read.;This is rather a tough question. It completely depends on the book. Some stories are told better in the first person while others are told better in third person limited or third person omniscient.  ;I think it&apos;s especially interesting because the word &apos;mad&apos; has so many different definitions, many of which can apply to Alice and the other Wonderland characters at different times.;Well, I loved Alice when I was younger and still do today. The Annotated Alice is extremely helpful and enriched my experience as a reader.I also love everything about Sandman, and I never thought about it before, but it is quite similar to Alice. Perhaps you didn&apos;t just get all the little inside jokes in Alice because it wasn&apos;t your time or culture...that&apos;s why the Annotated version is really helpful.I also loved the dream sequence in Dumbo and the one in Winnie-the-Pooh (the Heffalumps and Woozles). They are so colorful and fun. Maybe I&apos;m just weird, but I&apos;ve always loved fantasy sequences like that. I mean, this is a Fantasy/Sci-Fi course after all.;Florencia is absolutely right. Bear in mind, that you are reading his journal, not his thoughts. So, he is writing as a reflection back on what he just went through. Of course he is going to have stereotypical descriptions, as he can only take in, remember, and record so much information, so it&apos;s the stuff that appears most often and the stuff that has the largest impact on his mind that he writes down.As for the gay references...where are they? Are you talking about Mina and Lucy? But it seems you&apos;ve not gotten to them yet? Are you talking about how Harker is studying Dracula so obsessively?;Bram Stoker never visited Transylvania and the geography described in Dracula is not always accurate. He did consult books, but I always read his Transylvania as a fictional place that is only loosely based on the real. He obviously could not have described the country people completely accurately, and only used them as minor characters anyway to set the tone (often such minor characters are stereotypical anyway).Carmen, I do believe you are looking for something that is not quite there. Yes, many English/European writers could be biased and downright racist at times, but Bram Stoker was Irish. He was rather appalled at English oppression because of that fact. Javier is absolutely right about the differences between doctors and peasants (after all, education comes into play here) and if you keep reading, you will find some English characters that are not so gentlemanly. So, I doubt there is any type of racism there.;Well, I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have seen some wonderfully insightful posts in the forums and some that...aren&apos;t so wonderfully insightful, but it shows that people are thinking in any case! I know a lot of the students enrolled are not active on the forums, but perhaps there are some that are not putting their full effort into the essays for a variety of reasons. Hopefully you will see improvements next week!;Well, the books do not seem that ancient to me, but that&apos;s probably because I&apos;m also in the middle of a Greek and Roman Mythology course. I agree with both Megan and Amber: The required texts are not all that old and it&apos;s nice to have as many of them as possible in the public domain. I think the choices were also made on the basis of how much of an impact the texts had on both the genre, and on people/history in general. Most of the titles are recognizable, and a lot of the students on here have read some or most of the works already, meaning they are important to the genre as a whole, and have influenced readers, writers, and scholars alike.;</string>
            <string>Laura,I&apos;m sure Bram Stoker had some similar views with people of his time regarding race, but I just don&apos;t see it in this novel in the way that the OP did. He was indeed Irish, and as you might assume, didn&apos;t look favorably on the English as a general rule. Dracula has been interpreted as a satirical text in which Stoker is actually pointing out how the English are frightened of outsiders and outside influence. He goes so far to make them seem horrified by it. There is also an interpretation that Dracula was a metaphor for England as a whole, &quot;sucking the blood out of people&quot; just because he could. How accurate these views are is debatable, but it does rather put one off the view of his holding the English higher than any other culture. There is no doubt that he did not accurately describe Transylvania and his inhabitants, as has already been said, but again, other than Dracula (and his women) the Transylvanians were minor characters, meant to add drama and a spooky atmosphere. Many writers make their similar minor characters stereotypical for just that same reason: to create a certain type of atmosphere. ;)  ;It is most acceptable in an academic setting to not use the word &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; in an essay. You should not be writing your personal opinion like this: &quot;I didn&apos;t like it very much because....&quot; but should be more assertive by writing something like this: &quot;Although this is considered a classic work of literature, there are many flaws, such as....&quot;Hopefully that makes sense.;This is not necessarily true, Paul. I teach English and there is a very powerful urge to get students writing professionally. My teacher training required that students are taught how to write an essay with a strong thesis in the third person. In all of my college level classes (both graduate and undergrad) it was not acceptable to write an academic paper (analysis or essay) in the first person. It was only used in creative writing assignments.  ;https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=193;I love Mel Brooks. Have you ever seen Young Frankenstein? A Dracula movie by him would be great. Though, I&apos;m not certain I get all of your song titles... : /;I completely agree with Anna. Looking critically at any text should not take the magic out of it but should add a deeper level of understanding. Alice in Wonderland, for example, seems to have frustrated a lot of people on this forum, but I think the main reason for that is because they did not understand the multiple layers of the literature. I think a lot of people had this notion that it was a children&apos;s book and went into the reading thinking it was going to be &apos;easy&apos; or &apos;whimsical&apos; when it really takes a sharp mind, some research, and some higher order thinking to fully enjoy the brilliance of the work.  When it comes to creative writing, I have found that all of my literature classes have really intensified my own writing. I don&apos;t always write with lots of symbols in mind, or try to include subtle hints about themes in my work, but sometimes I do. A lot of times, I just want to write a fun story with lots of swashbuckling and sword play. Other times, I am in my poetic mood and my writing is much more literary. Either way, reading, analyzing, and discussing other books has greatly improved my own writing. I have found that when I plan a new story, I can jot down a few themes I might want to include and find that I have added many more when I get through it, without even realizing I was doing so. However, I always think to myself that I want my readers to be entertained first, and if my work has informed them about something, inspired them to create something, or made them think deeply about something, that is a bonus.;</string>
            <string>This is a great discussion, all. I have really gotten a lot out of it by lurking here.  It was amazing that I opened the Wall Street Journal today and spotted a review on   Who Was Dracula? by Jim Steinmeyer. All of you interested in Stoker&apos;s relationship with Wilde and Whitman and Irving would probably like to read this book.  Here&apos;s a link to an online review:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578553403814447228.htmlPerhaps the best quote from the review is:&quot;The open-endedness of Stoker&apos;s characterization makes it easy for each successive generation to reinvent Dracula according to its own preoccupations.&quot; Certainly we, as contemporary readers are finding things in the book that readers a century ago or even fifty years ago didn&apos;t find, of it they did, would never have discussed in public. This ability of Dracula  to affect a wide variety of readers throughout many generations is just one testament to its literary worth.  The same can be said, I think, of many great classic novels.  ;Great idea for a thread, Kristine. I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have been dismayed at all the issues people are having over the peer reviews. I am sincerely sorry that there is so much consternation over them.  I have read everything we&apos;ve been assigned to read so far, but I am reading it all again and really loving some of the discussions on here about the literature. The lectures are informative, but a little slow-moving for me. I don&apos;t know why, but I can only watch a couple at a time and I am not through all of the Dracula ones yet. But I am just going through the course at my own pace.Despite all of the &apos;I hate this book&apos; comments, I think there have been some great insights on the forums. I have particularly enjoyed some of the discussions about Dracula. I think it&apos;s wonderful that people of all different ages and from different cultures can find so many similarities in the works (some &apos;universal truths&apos; if you will). But it is also fascinating to see how original ideas pop up and how many of us have differing views about a piece. Keep up the great discussions, Courserians!;Greek and Roman Mythology if you&apos;re interested. You must write one essay (but you can write two if you choose throughout the course). These essays are peer reviewed, but the numbers given by peers in no way reflect the final grade. Rather, you must take a quiz every week about the readings and the lectures. Trust me, the quizzes are quite difficult and some of the questions really make you think. It is an excellent course if you&apos;re interested in the subject.  ;</string>
            <string>Your response is a bit overwhelming.    I am concerned that the rather heavy reading list for this course will not leave a lot of   writing.   I started the reading list last week and have made good progress, so I now think in can do both.   I hope you feel the same.My current writing project is to write short stories that provide images of people successfully tackling the great problems of the 21st century.   The science fiction short story served this purpose for much of the last century, but currently Sci-Fi blockbuster movies have completely lost this purpose and direction.Our working idea is to put out a series of e-books under the general name &quot;Hard Squared Science Fiction&quot;.   The first volume is complete but release has been delayed by a bazaar roadblock.   The second volume has now been started and has attached some support already.   Each volume is an independent collaboration.The current story ideas are grouped into themes:1.   Human Space exploration -- This my field and I have three stories available for review.   We now have a storyboard we need expanded into a short story:   http://woodwaredesigns.com/EBook/CepheisDragons.2.   Sustainable Earth -- These are stories about people addressing ecological problems.   We currently have a complex story idea based on a series of TED presentations (space need not be mentioned).3.   First Contact -- Stories about what it would mean to humans to contact star people.   We how have three stories in this series, but the next one needs to be written from the point of view of a porpoise.In each case, the idea is to make the stories about character as much as the technical situations they are in.Please let me know if you would like a review copy of any of these story by email (yet more reading.)If you have story ideas the might fit our general theme (solving the porlbmes of the 21st century), please let me know..   I would be happy to review them as we need collaboratorsI would also be happy to review your short essays for this course.   Each of the stories in our project is supported by a short technical essay, so this should be good practice.Thanks for you interest,Tom Riley;</string>
            <string>Big fan here!  I only learned about his illness a couple of weeks ago and it left me pretty devastated. He also always seems (almost wrote seemed but he&apos;s fortunately still with us) to be a genuinely nice and good humored guy.  ;</string>

I hope you had a back-up stored somewhere or you have sublimed.;Some very interesting observations here. The thing that jumps out of the pages when I read the TOG series is Martin&apos;s diction. Open any book on any page and notice the word choice. Particularly when he is describing a scene or segueing from one event to another. Walking down alleys or across a corridor in a castle the words have a tendency to build up and reinforce a particular colour or image. If he is talking about gold there will be references to candle or sunlight immediately afterwards, if he has written about a sword the word choices will have a quality of sharpness to them in the ensuing sentences.     Yes his ability to create believable and human characters in a fantasy world is remarkable. How does a man in his sixties convincingly write from the perspective of a young girl for example? I feel that this is one of the toughest challenges in writing. This particularly holds true when writing science fiction as there are often times when the writer is faced with the task of creating characters whose frame of reference is completely alien. If anyone has any thoughts on how to achieve this I would be very much appreciative of your input during the course. But truly what makes his books come alive for me is his ability to weave words into a visceral image that drags you into the scene. Consider the title; &apos;A song of Ice and Fire&apos;. How primal an image and how expertly this image is reflects the counterpoint and harmony between the characters. Both substances give life in moderation and destroy it in excess. Just as his characters are neither truly good nor evil, merely caught up in a twist of fate. A song of Ice and fire.        ;</string>
            <string>Very sad, he was hoping to have had longer.  ;Sci-Fi is used as a predictor of possible future events based on new technologies and experiements. What about novels such as Stephen King&apos;s &quot;The Stand&quot;, decimation due to a virus escaping from a secret lab? Or an old school movie such as &quot;Terminator&quot; in which computers take over the world? It seems as if both are saturated with possibilities related to human creation and exploration based on scientific advances and peoples fears of them. The chance the advancements occuring would destroy the world as we know it is a strong theme in many stories. Right now there is a strong focus on viruses. Terrorist activities still abound in writing, TV shows and movies. What else is happening and/or advancing that will generate books, movies and TV shows? ;Wait, what? &quot;Night Watch&quot; _Pentalogy_? I didn&apos;t know there was a fifth book being published!  After a quick Wikipedia investigation, I see it&apos;s been published in Russia but not released to the US market yet (and I can&apos;t even imagine how long it will take to get to the market here in Mexico, if it gets here at all). I guess I&apos;ll have to wait a few months more.;</string>

Surely it would be better to number them in order (1-5) as you go along.;Overall Grade: 4.5The Grimm Brothers: Growth and Fertility Many themes are presented throughout the Grimm Brothers tales. Coming  of age is one, where transitions of womanhood and the beginnings of  fertility are represented. With this comes loss of innocence and leaving  behind childhood. In the tale of Rapunzel, the fertility theme is presented  early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of rampion. When the  King   s son climbs through the window, Rapunzel is shocked as she comes  face-to-face with the first man she has ever laid eyes upon. Her coming  of age occurs when she accepts his hand in marriage, thus becoming his  wife and the bearer of his children. With Aschenputtel,  fertility is represented by the lentils that she must pick up. She is no  longer a child when the King   s son recognises her as his partner and  takes her for his wife. Sleeping Beauty dives deeper into the state of fertility,  with Rosamund pricking her finger. The blood from this is a symbol of  the medieval belief that a child becomes a woman when she begins  menstruation. In addition, Rosamund falls asleep as a child and wakes up  as a woman. The thorns surrounding the castle are an icon of growth and  serve as a cocoon until the 100 year curse is complete. Similar to this  is the tale of Snow White, where she falls asleep as a na  ve  child and wakes as a learned woman. In this example, the reader is made  aware early on of Snow White   s coming of age, as she becomes fairest of  all. The ripened apple acts as the symbol of fertility. The coming of age and happiness of these women depends upon their  attachments to a male and their social acculturation. This theme is  constant throughout these tales up until the end, where they cannot  remain or return home to their states as children.Works Cited: Rapunzel; Aschenputtel; Sleeping Beauty; Snow White - Grimm - Children&apos;s and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation).FORM = 2peer 2      This student&apos;s grammar and punctuation are very good.

However, because of the limited word count, it might have been  beneficial to concentrate on just one or two stories and add more  details about those.peer 4      1- The chosen topic is interesting, I like how you&apos;ve explained the  blood or the apple as being symbols/metaphors.  2- If there is one thing I would mention, it would be that even though  your readers will most likely know what your referring to in this case,  some explanation might help, for instance why some symbols are  considered a sign of fertility. Or even how &quot;the fertility theme is  presented early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of  rampion.&quot; maybe something as simple as (craving) would have explained  it.;Nope.

            <string>This isn&apos;t a case of someone not reading my essay, but rather someone trying to nitpick.

I&apos;m really annoyed by that one reviewer.;I think by &quot;child figure&quot; the prof meant a character at the forefront with the other characters.;</string>

            <string>We have a lot of reading to do - a lot of people have started on Dracula and/or Little Brother because they are longer. You could do that while you&apos;re waiting. Or discuss the Grimm stories on the related board. ;I think you can do them again.   It may be that you learned stuff from the lectures, but let&apos;s see if you can apply it.   More&apos;s the point, let&apos;s see whether other students think what you learned was good or not!   Kind of a 360 review!;I&apos;ve read Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales several times and I feel the same way. Many stories often feel very sexist, classist, and simplistic in its plot, with unbelievably dim characters. Often times, the &quot;heroine&quot; wins the day by being kind, sweet, but most importantly, beautiful, and that&apos;s about it. However, when I read these stories, I have a mindset that they are more like morality tales, almost like Aesop&apos;s Fables. No, they don&apos;t always have a moral at the end, but I can imagine parents telling their kids these tales to help teach them lessons to &quot;be good or else.&quot;  That being said, I did enjoy some of them, including &quot;The Twelve Brothers, Robber Bridegroom, and The Fisherman and his Wife.&quot; If you are interested, you should read Catherynne Valente&apos;s The Orphan&apos;s Tale  duo, which re-tell many of the fairy tales in beautiful, enchanting language.  Hope this helps!;Interesting point, Lindsay. I hadn&apos;t thought of that one. So many aspects we&apos;re digging out collectively.  Love it! Thanks.;I think the genre &quot;fairy tale&quot; contains various sub-genres.   Some of the Grimms&apos; stories are definitely morality tales, in which the good are rewarded (usually after persevering through some trial) and the wicked are punished.   But others belong to the folk hero genre, or maybe the trickster genre, like Tom Thumb, where the hero wins through cleverness and trickery.   We generally understand that while some of the stories are given as examples of good behavior, not all of them are.;</string>

I really enjoyed the book and the forums, so it&apos;s all good. In flipping through my text I came across a quote that made me laugh and if anyone else is experiencing a little stress, maybe it will help lighten your spirit too:&quot;There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&quot;Gotta love Van Helsing!;I know what you mean Rosie.I have been a bit overwhelmed because there were so many things of interest in the novel, and I can&apos;t seem to focus on one good essay topic.

I really enjoyed Van Helsing too!;I was reading this email not knowing who it was from and when I got to the part: &quot;  In that sense, there&apos;s another kind of perversion going on, and perhaps the more central one than the religious since there is no child figure anywhere in the book.&quot; and I said that&apos;s not true, what about the several children that Lucy attacked in her un-dead state and then I saw the message was from the prof. Hmmm, am I missing something?;</string>
            <string>This peer review process is interesting. I believe this is the third Coursera course I have taken with peer review. After the first one, I felt that perhaps the peer review was the most difficult aspect of the course - but also the greatest opportunity for learning and development for me personally. In that first peer review course we had a week to review, and it was a painstaking process for me. It&apos;s hard! I suddenly had a deep appreciation for all of the teachers in my life!  This process is a bit of a crap-shoot. You are going to have reviewers that don&apos;t put in much effort or much thought. But remember that there are plenty of reviewers out there who do.  I have been very fortunate with my reviewers. My first couple of essays came in as 4s with helpful commentary - all of which I agreed with. I actually scored a 6 on the Dracula essay and was shocked and very gratified. I had a lot of trouble trying to get this essay together and almost didn&apos;t submit one. I woke up on deadline morning, tried again and submitted with 1 hour and 14 minutes to go! But the score was not what brought me to tears - it was the comments. All of the comments were thoughtful and helpful and just made my heart soar (I&apos;m sorry, but they really did!).So, for those of you who are having a less uplifting time, please hang in there! There are so many thoughtful, interesting people taking this class and you can see that from the Discussion Forums. I think this is the 8th Coursera course I&apos;ve taken, but this Discussion Forum is BY FAR the best. It&apos;s worth the price of admission.;Megan, I love that quote as well. Part of me sighed and saw an 18-year old mentality in so many aspects of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and yet:   These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquilized it.    - that sounds fairly mature for an 18-year old!;Something I didn&apos;t understand... Ch.4 when Victor is creating the monster.. he says &quot;It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being (can you say hubris?) As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionately large.&quot; I think I missed the implication of this in the first reading. He made him huge because he was incredibly LAZY and now I hate him so much more.;It&apos;s been almost 40 years since I read all the Foundation books. Sadly, I had to google Seldon vault.

            <string>Sean - sorry for your connectivity issues. What I got from the H/P before you read: these stories are about science; scientia (latin) - knowledge, knowing, acquaintance, skill. Each of the works we&apos;ll read demonstrate at least one and often several different ways of knowing. Sci Fi is, among other things, about what it is to know. The Prof also made sure to let us know that it we certainly didn&apos;t have to write our essay on all the works read. Perhaps focusing on something from one story, or poem, or if we see a connection we&apos;d like to follow. He reiterated the part about enriching our fellow students. Hope this helps.;I know it&apos;s water under the bridge at this point, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am that Prof. Rabin mentioned in his &quot;Before you read&quot; video for Mary Shelley&quot; that we read both the 1818 Intro and the 1833 Intro. My downloaded version had neither, and they are so important. Thank you to fellow classmates for posting those links.I am still trying to process Prof. Rabin&apos;s statement at the end of the video 04.09 where he states that Mary Shelley creates Science Fiction - &quot;Simply taking the Gothic, recognizing its fantastic, romantic power and saying from the outset, this is the nature of the world you are entering, allow the creation of a genre in which the knowledge gained by exploring that world is meant to make us understand the realities of a human seeking humanity, and the knowledge that makes human life available.&quot;In this generic move, MS created science fiction. I need more thinking time.;That sounds interesting - can you post the link?;</string>
            <string>Hi Anon,Hope you are having better luck. I agree with Suzan - I found my browser can make the difference. I work at a desktop and like to use Chrome. Sometimes Chrome just won&apos;t load the videos and I finally realized I should switch browsers and had no problems in Firefox. I also sometimes get hang and freeze issues with videos if I pause them (to take notes) too frequently. Again, for me switching to Firefox helped.

            <string>I know there are more than a few writers in this class, so I thought I&apos;d check if anyone else was headed to the Kachemak Bay Writer&apos;s Conference this weekend. If so, I&apos;ll see you there!;I have been thinking about the way Alice changes sizes in almost every chapter of &quot;Wonderland.&quot; At first, the changes are unpredictable, but after she has both sides of the mushroom, she is able to control and fine-tune her size for the later encounters.Very generally, the four settings are human size, small size (with small animals), tiny size (with the caterpillar), and large size. And this made me think of the races in Grimm&apos;s fairy tales: humans, dwarves, elves, and giants. If Grimm&apos;s folktales draw distinctions between peoples of different sizes with different names, what does it mean when a little girl can move from one size to another freely -- skipping across the borders between the mundane world and the fantastic world, with as little effort as the bite of a mushroom? (Food = knowledge? Mushroom --&gt; pyschedelic, mind expanding, transcending planes of existence?)Any other thoughts on her changing of size, or on this parallel with the Grimm reading?;To answer your question &quot;Why aren&apos;t people more offended?&quot; all I can do is give you my personal perspective.I see that there are acts of violence and cruelty in Grimm&apos;s fairy tales. However, it never crossed my mind for a second that anything that happened within the pages was true. Certainly, if I had been under the impression that Grimm&apos;s fairy tales were a true history of actual events, I would be disturbed.The description of events was not very graphic, or visual. I find horror and slasher films to be much more traumatizing, which is why I choose not to watch them.Also, I understand that violent actions may be a symbol for something else. I imagine if a friend told me that they had a dream where they chopped my head off, I would be disturbed at first, but then I would say to myself, &quot;I don&apos;t think my friend  actually wants to chop my head off. I think it is symbolic of something else.&quot; The imagery in folk tales is very dream-like, and should be read as such.That said, I understand how you feel. Often, when I listen to the news, I feel overwhelmed with all the terrible things that are happening in the world. Sometimes, I need to take a break from the news for a while. So I do, for a few days. Then I come back to it. It is more important to me to feel informed than to feel undisturbed, but I still need a break sometimes.I was once told, &quot;sensitivity  is a strength, too much sensitivity is a weakness.&quot; I find this to be true.This is a free class, and you will lose nothing by choosing not to participate, other than the experience of the class. If you find that you cannot process the content, maybe this is not the right class for you. If it very important to you to take the class, maybe you can sign up for a future session when you are feeling a little more resilient. You can decide what is best for you.

            <string>I haven&apos;t read  Cloud Atlas, but I was reminded of a friend&apos;s description of the structure of that novel as &quot;nested stories&quot; as I read Frankenstein: The story of the monster embedded in the story of the doctor embedded in the letters.  ;The way the monster tells his story, he says that the way he was treated by his creator and by other humans, that is the way he was nurtured, led him to commit horrific acts.But, the because of the way he was made, with his huge, terrifying size and his mangled features, that is to say his nature, made him a scary creature. If Dr. Frankenstein had made a beautiful creature, or even one that looked like a normal human being, do you think the creature would have been treated the way he was?In all my readings in biology and anthropology, whenever the question of &quot;is such-and-such behavior genetically or environmentally determined&quot; is raised, it seems to me that the answer I find most probable is always &quot;Both factors interact.&quot;;Keep in mind that the &quot;cultivated&quot; creature was not initially that way -- the creature describes a time when he could not even distinguish his different senses, nor could he understand the spoken word. He begins as brutish and then transforms into a more well-spoken individual. (As a side note: Dr. Frankenstein has the opposite transformation: a young man of learning transforms, through grief, self-loathing, and misery, into a madman) The creature initially seems to be &quot;frustrated by its limitations,&quot; as you put it, and I assume it was from this early stage that the movie portrait was drawn. I think each version is well suited to its medium. In literature, well-spoken characters can more easily make their case, especially when dealing with complex subjects such as these, because the medium of literature is composed of words. Film, being a visual medium, can transmit a different sort of message, through the performances of the actors and other visuals, and therefore verbosity is not necessarily  required to convey the same ideas.;</string>

            <string>That&apos;s really a good idea. It feels so weird doing a course with people from so many different places: I didn&apos;t realise it before actually looking at the map!;I think Utopian and Dystopian novels are fantasy or sci-fiction. The confusion remains because most of the Utopian and Dystopian novels are mainstream literature while most of the fantasy and sci-fiction novels are regarded as non-mainstream literature. The truth is, some fantasy and science fiction novels were categorized as popular literature at the time they firstly published and then turned out to be influential, far-reaching and insightful. As time goes by, they became classic. So may be the definition of Utopian and Dystopian does not parallel with the definition of fantasy and sci-fiction. They cross sometimes.  ;</string>

            <string>I see the beauty of the story, but I also see the tragedy of real people. Owen created a magnificent mechanical butterfly . . . but nothing else. Annie created a life, a family, a child, all of which are far more precious. Owen might be romantic, but he is definitely tragic. Yes, he created something beautiful and perfect in his own eyes, but  his terrible flaw is that he is simply blind to everything beyond himself. If he had been able to broaden his perspective even a little bit (&quot;compromise&quot; is NOT a bad word), he could have had both the butterfly and the family. Instead, his singlemindedness cost him everything of real value. I&apos;ve known a lot of artists over the years, and the more Owen-ish they are in this regard, the more misery they experience and inflict on those who love them. Artists who have flexible perspective on priorities in life and art are typically more able to succeed in both realms.;</string>

            <string>Does anyone know what format we are using(APA, MLA)?;That is a very interesting take on the stories.   Honestly I tend to take things at face value.   I think these are stories told simply to be stories.   When a child asks a parent to tell them a bedtime story it is not  necessarily  wrought with symbolism(though some parents may have ulterior motives behind their stories) but sometimes just pure fantasy.   If and when there is symbolism to be found I think it is a  subconscious  factor.   The number of three comes up in many cultures, offhand I am reminded of the three trials Hercules went through and there would not have been Christian symbolism in that.   On the other hand this is a collection of stories from Germany in the 1800&apos;s many of which probably date back to the Dark Ages.   I would not be surprised if there are stories the church helped doctor to make almost modern day parables.;I just wrote my paper on deception in these tales and totally forgot about Grethel.   I find the stories are just lush with liars.  ;I figured the cock was forcing the world to grieve with him by making them a part of the procession.

            <string>Dillsburg, PA, USA! ;They became more concerned with the credibility of their ideas than the ideas themselves. Yes, I agree. Good point.;That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.I&apos;ve always assumed that one of the major reasons for sci-fi/fantasy is that it&apos;s easier to deal with really tough issues by putting them into alternate realities, allowing us to explore the morality and ethics of situations and ways of being by dissociating them from the baggage they have in our world. SFF novels, series, films and comics have always held up a distorting mirror that weirdly provides a sharper, clearer image of our own behaviours. X-Men made huge points about how society treats minorities (and the fact that none of us actually fit all that neatly into the category of &quot;normal&quot;); Sandman explored sex and gender identities and orientations explicitly, amongst many, many other issues; Watchmen showed up the awful logical outcomes of a world in which there really are superheroes; Star Trek routinely explored morality from the perspective of a society that had had to crawl back from nuclear holocaust and build an egalitarian, co-operative Utopia just to survive...  A friendly acquaintance and I got into a heated discussion about whether the technology in sci-fi should drive or serve the story. I&apos;m a character-driven story fan (&quot;The ship needs to be real because it&apos;s a backdrop for the people&apos;s stories!&quot;); for him, the characters were secondary to descriptions of tech (&quot;I don&apos;t care about the people - I want to know about the mechanics of the ship!&quot;), and what it could do and how. In the end, he conceded that there needs to be a story to tell, or it&apos;d just be a technical manual; I conceded that there was a whole chunk of geekdom that isn&apos;t fussed about characterisation, and that this was just fine.;Sometimes I think the difference (often blurred) between science fiction and fantasy is mainly in the need to explain the mechanisms; the how and the why rather than the consequences. For example, in fantasy we might accept dragons, elves or even FTL drives in a plot without needing to know their design principles; wheras in SF (excuse the abbrieve) we might want to understand how they were bred, evolved or researched. I see Star Wars as mostly fantasy with bits of SF but I think this too changed over the series. The &apos;force&apos; was originally magic(al), but then became a heritable and selectable trait fuelled by mitochondrial-like organelles (!). In Dr Who (the early years) we had many &apos;what-if&apos; fantasy stories where the science was an almost incidental and unknowable plot device; but that has increasingly given way to engineering and bio-engineering explanations of the fantasy &apos;tools&apos; and players. Whereas older (pre-information-culture?) stories seemed to accept that special powers just happened or were given/awarded; nowadays SF (or at least a subset of it) requires a plausible scentific explanation (&apos;origin-stories&apos;?) before we can engage with the plot. Perhaps because we are generally more technologically knowledgable today as a society and we don&apos;t simply accept that things are unfathomable and we expect to know how they work?  Does this relate to the thread title? I think so - because we are generally much less easily awed. Given our exposure to so much media every day, much of which is scientific and a lot of which is itself pretty awesome (genomics, nanotech, LHC, robotics, synthetic biology); it takes quite a lot to surprise us. However, given the massive increase in publications and other SF/fantasy products now available compared to previous decades, the cumulative awe is probably greater now than it ever has been :) ;I think Carlos just simplified the debate and put a valid point forward. I fear we were diverging into the &quot;Let&apos;s define what Sci-fi is&quot; category.The more knowledgeable a reader is, the more detailed explanations must be in order for disbelief to be suspended. This causes writers to try more and more to put in detailed explanations, which in turn causes two things:1. The idea (or tech, or concept, whatever) that needed an explanation becomes less exaggerated and/or grand than first intended, as the writer struggles for internal consistency.2. The inherent &apos;wonder&apos; that comes with the lack of a complete explanation is somewhat er... deflated.I mean, think about it. You&apos;re watching a magician perform, and you&apos;ve already read the how-to manual. How &apos;awesome&apos; would you feel the performance was? Even if the theatricality, the lighting etc was spot on, the fact that you already know how he does the damn thing makes it a little less impressive, even if it makes you feel a little more clever than the rest of the crowd.So the awesome isn&apos;t gone, but as Matthew so aptly said yesterday, &quot;Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.&quot;I&apos;m not suggesting we revert to soft sci-fi as in the 50s, (as it would cause a much shorter suspension of disbelief in today&apos;s time) but rather that a balance be found somewhere between. Give details to make the whole thing more believable, but let the wizard do it a couple of times.Call it taking a tricky stance, but why do I feel like I&apos;m trying to talk between Kirk and Spock?;I love these. Sadly I&apos;ve only read the first two issues. And all of my local comic book stores closed down. I should get back to them.  ;Being a computer geek myself, my inspirational movies are TRON and The Last Starfighter.;My point was that if the story were taking place today, and the stated amount of gold was exchanged for the same amount of labor, it would be on the high side for an apprenticeship but not unreasonable or excessive, especially since the Master was satisfied with the job Hans did.This story appeared in the 1812 edition of Grimms&apos;, and at the time gold in the United States was valued by statute at $15 per ounce, so US$2400 for 160 ounces. The West Egg calculator estimates that $2400 in 1812 dollars would had the purchasing power of $31,919 in 2012 dollars.;That would be 626.75 cubic inches of volume, and the density of gold is 10.18 troy ounces per cubic inch. That&apos;s  6380.315 troy ounces, divided by 14.583 troy ounces per pound, yielding about 437.5 pounds (almost 200kg).  ;</string>
            <string>I agree with you Gabbi, to a point. They would more than likely be proud that their works are being analysed and appreciated in the depths that we are going to. But let&apos;s be honest for a moment. This is all academic once we consider the larger context that these lessons have essentially been obliterated by the last generation of first world children. (not all of them, and this is not an anti-first-world-rant). But, I do think they would be saddened to see the watered down versions of their tales, and how their misuse has left children confused and maybe a little over-enchanted.;</string>

            <string>Ottawa, Ontario here.;Robert Jordan, J R R Tolkien, G R R Martin and Brandon Sanderson are my favourite writers. Just finished the Wheel of Time series, and found it brilliant.I enjoy the works of Plato, Euripedes (and Shakespeare) as well, and Homer&apos;s Illiad is one of my favourite pieces of verse, although I find more of a connection with the more contemporary writers. (Perhaps the familiarity of context?) Have also been brought up on the Mahabharata and Ramayana, both works of the classical period of my own country. Amongst (technically) non-fantasy writers, I have been an avid follower of Robert Ludlum, Sir Arthur C. Doyle and Ashwin Sanghi (Chanakya&apos;s Chant) among others.I&apos;d elaborate further, but I risk rambling. Quite obviously, I find myself drawn to Heroic fantasy and thrillers. Don&apos;t really have the time to read much anymore unfortunately (a job along with college, anyone?), so I dearly hope I can keep up with you guys through this course.;</string>

            <string>Kolkata, India; added as well :);I also just completed The final book in the Wheel of Time series and I&apos;d have to say that it defines epic fantasy as a genre. A lot of people say Tolkien reigns supreme with Lord of the Rings, but I would argue that Jordan has more passion and writes from a place of experience rather than (as with Tolkien) for a profit. ;Hi Nandini. I am shashi from Hyderabad. Currently in California. This is my first class ever with coursera. Please count me in. Looking forward for you support. Thank you so very much.;No I&apos;d say that&apos;s precisely on the topic! An an excellent point. The presence of Sci-Fi all around makes Sci-Fi itself become more derivative of ... itself.;That&apos;s a very good point, the cart has been put before the horse, as it were.;I would agree that this is dipping dangerously close to Hard v. Soft Sci-Fi. I find it interesting that Gar noted Sci-Fi taking technology of today or soon-to-be today, and explore ramifications. It seems to me that the pivotal difference between today&apos;s Sci-Fi and that of yester-year (1950&apos;s) was that they used to employ the method of finding a new and interesting problem, and imagining the kind of technology that might solve that problem. The Science part of the Fiction seemed much more imaginative because of the abundance of problems yet to be solved.;I would argue that there&apos;s a strong difference between fictionalizing fantasy science, and actually creating new science. The explanations some people want would be found much more at home within the pages of a scientific journal. They want every question answered with solid realities, which takes a story right out of Fiction altogether.For magic, the person who comes to mind is Penn Jillette. He mostly does know how magic works (and a whole lot of other things), yet still enjoys watching somebody perform. He enjoys it because if it&apos;s done well enough, it can bring back his disbelief (in Magic, disbelief is a good thing) for a moment.It seems to me that it&apos;s okay to give as vague an explanation as to say that the method used to communicate instantly across the globe involves wires, or relays or something (clearly with a nod to the 50&apos;s). I think Sci-Fi absolutely could do with a little more fantasy, and a little less attempt at being Science itself. Sci-Fi is there to come up with the ideas, not the actual working technologies.;I, for one, am deterred by a book if the bulk of a sci-fi novel is filled with detailed descriptions of the technology. Tell me what I need to know to understand why it&apos;s important to the story - but more than that is just showing off.Yes, the author should have thought about it. In depth. That&apos;s part of the writer&apos;s job.  But - there are several authors I no longer read because, although their stories are interesting, they seem to be too invested in making sure the reader knows &quot;I did my research.&quot; It bogs down a story for me....;In my view, the narrative, plot, characters and world-building is the entirety of a story. In Sci-Fi, the fictional (though often plausible) science is a part of each of those. The Narrative has to be done well enough that it isn&apos;t bogged down with too much information, but that it does adequately explain what&apos;s going on and tells its story. The Plot has to necessitate the technologies, or they become nothing but a gimmick for show. The Characters have a certain set of knowledge, which is sometimes expansive (Star Trek) and sometimes they know next to nothing (Philip K. Dick&apos;s writings usually); either way, they have to be able to express themselves through the story, and not be relegated to names and faces attached to a technical manual. The World-building seems most important of all; if you were to read a book like Snow Crash and the world-building was not done well enough, you would have nothing to visualize and might not understand the reasons for the technologies they are using. World-Building, in my view, is what happens when the other factors are done perfectly.;Well in six soldiers of fortune none of the men were of a particularly high social class, yet the leader was still lucky in the sense that he found comrades to help him and they were able to trick the king and become rich, but then again none of them were &quot;heros&quot; so maybe I&apos;m wrong. Anyways, I think your thesis is insightful and I&apos;m going to re-read all of the Tales and make sure I pay attention to the social hierarchy.;mmm... I think it could be a reflect of that era. I mean, fairy tales work as mirrows of the social status of women and men on those years.;Praduymn, hahah, your comment made me laugh, I like how you twisted the sense.  And I totally agree with you on the theatricality bit. The exact salary is of little importance, I believe. What matters is the descendent (Or is it descendant? sorry there) value of his possesions.  ;This is great! I was wondering why the frog didn&apos;t splat against the wall when it was thrown by the princess ...(using my high school physics f=ma  -- I was pretty sure that a frog wouldn&apos;t survive).;What happens to f=ma (force equals mass times  accelleration)  when the mass suddenly increases from a one-pound frog to a 150-pound prince?   If we hold the force constant, there&apos;s a rapid decelleration and he floats harmlessly to the ground. But if we hold the accellertion constant, there&apos;s a  150-fold increase in force and he probably does get splattered.;According to Wikipedia, the European common frog, rana temporaria, weighs 22.7g (0.8 ounces) on average, so I was overestimating by quite a bit. Let&apos;s imagine our prince to be five-foot-ten--tall for his time but not freakishly so--and of an ideal weight to be considered handsome and athletic. There are several models in use to determine ideal weight:The J.D. Robinson formula (52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  156.5 lbsThe D.R. Miller formula (56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  155.0 lbsThe B.J. Devine  formula (50.0kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  160.9  lbsThe G.J. Hamwi formula (48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet) yields an ideal weight of  165.3 lbsI don&apos;t know which is best, so I will take an average: 159.4 lbs.  So turning from frog to prince has increased his mass by 3188 times. Let&apos;s just say he&apos;s about 3200 times more massive than before.How fast can a princess throw a frog weighing eight tenths of an ounce? I don&apos;t know, but women&apos;s fast-pitch softball throws can be clocked at up to 75 miles per hour. Granted, the princess is not a trained athlete, and a frog is not very aerodynamic, but the frog would weigh considerably less than a 6.25- to 7-ounce softball. Personally, I&apos;d allow her a 25 to 30 mph frog-pitch.Splat!;I&apos;d wager that the odds aren&apos;t actually in favor of my statement. I&apos;ve had a similar level of entertainment at least twice within the past seven days, and I&apos;m likely to have more within the next few. No matter how you define a week, this is likely just one of the most entertaining discussions I have/will seen/see this week.;I just wanna say, after this ends I&apos;m voting that this thread gets an award. Best thread, Best discussion, Best procrastination,... whatever.;TVTropes. Yes, awesome resource. Been addicted to it for a year, now.About the Bride and Switch.Latent fear, perhaps? It could echo a fear of being cheated on and/or or made a fool of, within the context of wedlock?Or (perhaps I&apos;m overreaching again) it could be a fear of not really knowing your bride-to-be very well, and only finding out her true colours (not very nice ones) after the wedding.Or, it might be an evolution of The Switch (not a trope per se, though it should be). As in, remember stories where the soon-to-be-killed hero would switch (or be switched) with another person/object? The story of Zeus and Cronos comes to mind. So, the Switch + The Unknown Bride = The Bride and Switch.Your post has got me thinking... Sure its a valid plot point, but why the constant recurrence? ;Hmmm... You&apos;re right. There seems to be more inside that cave. Time for some research.;&quot;That technique means that every time you&apos;re rooting for one of your  favorite characters, you&apos;re probably rooting against another one you  love.&quot;Well said.It makes it all the more dramatic AND realistic. In that way, its like watching your best friend and cousin fight each other... Been there.The fact that it makes you root for people on opposing sides of the line only enhances the grey on grey morality of the series. No good or evil people, or sides. Just (violently) different perspectives.;&quot; &apos;hard-built&apos; (does this expression exist?)&quot;   It does now. :PI completely agree with that point about loving and hating the same character! I&apos;ve always hated narratives that force you to try and sympathize with flat characters designated as the good guys. Martin and others like him are a breath of fresh air.Also, it hit me that not only does it create a more dramatic scenario, it also forces you to confront and debate with your own values and sense of morality... Overreaching?;</string>

            <string>Oh goodness. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve sank my teeth into any reading that wasn&apos;t journal articles.I am a huge, huge fan of poetry and my tastes range from Sappho to Spenser, from Eliot to Plath. I&apos;m currently in a bit of a Thomas Hardy and Victor Hugo kick at the moment. Although I think I shall need to leave Gabriel Oak to his sheep until this course is over....I&apos;ve not read much sci-fi, I confess. Well, aside from Douglas Adams, of course.  ;I have to disagree just a little. I think that the inclusion of a Faster Than Light technology, or any other as-yet nonexistent technologies pushes a story into what should rightly be called &quot;Science Fiction,&quot; and out of &quot;Fantasy.&quot; I think that the difference comes in when you make the distinction between Technology, and Magic. Technology is something clearly made of human imaginations and ingenuity, whereas Magic is a property of the world around you. In the case of Star Wars, it seems to be predominantly a Fantasy Space-Opera. But I really can&apos;t agree that a story is somehow required to have plausible explanations to be called Science Fiction. I also can&apos;t agree that the trend of plausible explanations being present is in any way new. Stories from the 1950&apos;s and even earlier often had very complex and imaginative technologies, complete with very plausible explanations. The only part that made it matter as far as calling it Science Fiction, was that the stories hinged around those components. If you can remove the hither-to-unknown science from a story and come out with the very same story - it was never Science Fiction.**Personal opinions, and last I checked there is no definitive answer on that.;There&apos;s a degree to which you don&apos;t have to explain the tech - who writes about someone getting in a car to go somewhere or turning up the thermostat to heat the house and goes into detail? If a world&apos;s really well imagined and concrete enough, we have to accept that some people in that world would love nothing more than to spend hours talking about how the technology works, while most would blithely use it without giving it a second thought unless/until it breaks down.I can&apos;t recall Ursula Le Guin explaining her ansibles beyond their ability to transmit communications instantaneously across space. But they worked so well as a taken for granted technology that they got lifted by Orson Scott Card and others.My tendency is to see categories as starting points; they soon become too messy and muddled to be really useful. There&apos;s more of a Venn diagram going on, or a 3D grid in which the varieties of SFF link up and merge.YMMV... :);Post-apocalyptic and dystopian sci-fi/fantasy was my childhood staple, along with every bit of mythology and fairy tales I could lay my mitts on. By 8, I knew the world was going to end in nuclear holocaust or natural disaster and go all Chrysalids or The Changes. And then the 80s happened: Mad Max, Threads, Terminator, Blake&apos;s 7, Z For Zacharia...  Strikes me that much of the now-popular zombie stuff was getting traction as we realised the extent of consumerism&apos;s horrifying effects on the environment (Romero kicked that one off), and leaked into the mainstream because of the factors you cite, Sean? Gah! Zombies. I can read vampire lit until it comes out of my ears (I don&apos;t count glittery vampires), but zombies freak me the hell out.;I&apos;m having some trouble tracking down the correct editions of these books in audio or Kindle-compatible format. I&apos;m legally blind, but I have only recently lost by ability to read paper-back sized text, so my computer is not set up to read to me. I figure if I can get a book onto my kindle, then IT, should read to me just fine. Or I can at least make the text super big. I&apos;d like to have both e-book and audio book versions of these texts, because I&apos;ll never be able to keep up this pace if I try to read it all myself but I&apos;ll need to be able to go back through and check quotes and things. It&apos;s been awhile since I was in school and my skills are quite rusty. Can anyone help me out? I&apos;ve spent the whole evening wrestling with this, with very little success.

Help!Sammy;</string>
            <string>I think that the real difference is the understanding that the author wants.  The  SF  makes  the audience  comprehend, and  piece together  what is being described.   Something  can  be described as &quot;narxical&quot; and &quot;copudrazational&quot; (completely made up words that might be used in fantasy), but regardless of  their accuracy, will not get the idea across. It  would make absolutely no sense to the reader.   Now describe things in  relatable terms  that the   audience could piece together,  so the audience can  envision terms/situations/characters/environment/emotions/actions.   For example:  &quot;a brilliant hue of blue, with a 3rd-Dimensional depth,  giving an illusion of varying shades of blue&quot;These things we can understand. Now, we build a color, and give it attributes, little by little, it can slowly be imagined. I think Dr. Suess can be the epitomy of fantasy.Fantasy: It all makes sense, in its own worldSF: Trying explain it to ours.Fantasy isn&apos;t about understanding, its more of just accepting that its there, and going on with story.....I think;I think the lines are absolutely blurred in the sci-fi/fantasy arena. Some pieces clearly fall in one camp or the other, but many are strongly both. I&apos;ve resorted to using the term &quot;speculative fiction&quot; with writings that are neither and/or both.I&apos;m careful with whom I use the term, since it sounds slightly snooty, but it describes the genre much better.  ;My take is that the first half is about the lack of altruism in normal social interactions. Everyone wants something tangible to exchange/sell in advance of their physical goods - business as normal. The second half is about how things change if you are marketing feelings and effort instead of things. If you have something socially powerful to &apos;sell&apos; (death, grief) - in this case people will give you intangible effort (sympathy, help) because you have already given them something intangible in advance (and perhaps because they hope / expect the same - funerals are a social thing after all, whereas business is usually personal). It is still not altruism. In both cases - payment up front, physical or emotional. So why does everyone die in the second half? The second half has two sub-halves:  1. the helpers that underestimate the effort that is needed and fail 2. the big procession that is too much and overwhelms the helpers and cock. I agree with others that these are both themes of being unable to cope. This is finished off by the cock himself being unable to cope in a different way - emotionally (dying of grief). So I think the first half is about life and selfishness; and the second half is all about grief and coping - in both halves the theme leans towards striving, failing and the roles of social interactions and responsibilities. Also - it is full of themes of immortality/mortality, life &amp; death: Pt 1 - life. Bride&apos;s &apos;red silk&apos; - I think that one is obvious reproductive symbolism :) Garland - the reproductive parts of plants (flowers) Willow - clear symbol of eternal life, reproduction (willow sticks grow new whole willows) Pt 2 - death. Stone - dead matter Straw - dead grass Coal - burns brightly until it is quenched then &apos;dies&apos;. Of course it doesn&apos;t actually make logical sense at all because the mice only make one wagon and that gets across with the hen on it. The rest of the procession then falls in with the wagon, even though that wagon presumably still has the hen&apos;s corpse on it - loaves and fishes anyone?? So we got an extra wagon from somewhere unless he dumped the corpse and went back - why would he do that ? Unless the social responsibilities of attending the followers became his additional burden.  Ultimately though, once the crowd had &apos;gone&apos; - it was just him and his wife.. The moral might be: Everybody dies, and the journey before death is full of all kinds of interactions and responsibilities wrt other people; some will help, some will hinder, but they all die too in the end and ultimately we all die alone. Cheery - no? :) P.s. I&apos;m also wondering/thinking  if the two brooks are the same ones and whether they represent the flow of time (life) which can sustain you or kill you.  ;Stephanie&apos;s post made me look back and wonder about a religious interpretation. I was running with the bride being a bride of Christ (nun) and the red silk being a (negative) reference to Catholicism ..as was the willow (used in place of Palms for Palm Sunday)... I was working up to the second half being about pagan symbolism: straw (corn) / fire / earth and a burial under the mound. However, I was then trying to shoe-horn in the other animals into the pagan part and did some research on the period - so I would like comments on the possibility that this story is actually historical; and specifically about the 30yrs war and the end of the Bohemian and Holy Roman Empires (everybody dies). This was a devastating religious war, started by a battle on White Mountain (!). Major involvement by the French (cock ?) where lots of countries / states joined in the procession of death (those animals - stag, bear, lion, wolf, fox, seem awfully heraldic to me). Too tenuous?? :)  I&apos;ve done my essay on something else - so this is just curiosity.. ;Personally I think that a view that is NOT the same as my own often enriches my reading more than one that is; even if it only prompts me to go back, try to see it the way they did and find evidence (or just possibiliites) one way or the other - maybe it will change my mind, maybe not, but either validating, challenging or surprising is IMHO enriching... And as for different personal backgrounds - it&apos;s like in Close Encounters - not everyone sees the same thing from the same perspective, and sometimes it helps to see things from the other side :) ;I think I&apos;m probably mainly with anonymous here. I do also agree that it could be a wish for a simpler time (before those dang steam machines came out of England and took away all our jobs).. but I suspect that references to the &apos;magical olden days&apos; are usually more personal and harken back to days when individuals had less responsibility - i.e. when they were children, or before they got married, or before they had debt, or children, or disease, or disappointment.  So, this seems like a bit of contaminating adult irony to me.However, as has been suggested in SF by Niven and others since, perhaps people genuinely thought that the magic had gone away compared to earlier times. Urbanisation, deforestation and the  concomitant loss of fauna might be mentally linked to the loss of the &apos;dark-woods&apos; and everything magical that lived there (wolves had already gone from the UK and Ireland by the time these tales were written down).  I also wonder about the timing - and how much effect that whole mess with Napoleon had on the stability and peace of mind of the storytellers canvassed for the &apos;Tales&apos;? Perhaps there was a real perception of loss of personal control compared to earlier..;This is fun   I&apos;m Edgar Allen Poe (from first essay).   Quite pleased with that :) ;I see what you are saying but I don&apos;t think this approach is easily separated into classic and modern.  K.J.Parker, Robert Jordan, George R Martin and Brian Aldiss (Helliconia) move their worlds quite glacially (particularly the last two ;p ) with a lot of focus on the secondaries. Whereas Wyndham, Wells and Verne shoot off at quite a pace with few characters and little effort on the side stories.  As for multiple climaxes - I heartily recommend Thomas Hardy - the original steam punk writer :/ - like Dickens he wrote episodically (for money) with a big crash at the end of every chapter. Far From The Madding Crowd is a great example... I like both.. ;I do wonder if that perception might be partially because a very large proportion of SF now seems to be Film/TV spin-offs compared to even a decade or two ago. Those mainly have a pretty strict time-frame and pace. Perhaps also as suggested above, more current SF seems to be Young Adult (judging by the shelves in bookshops - although we have always traditionally had our own ghetto by the children&apos;s books) than previously, and YA often has a faster pace and is frequently written from the perspective of a single main character that is representing the reader. ;</string>
            <string>Does anyone know if there is a way to get the material on a Nook?;My impression has always been that minorities are &apos;better represented&apos; in SF than in mainstream. I know that my &apos;phrase&apos; is contentious in terms of the representation given (token vs shock vs incorporated or otherwise making a point); but for the moment I&apos;d like to suggest that SF has often been ahead of the curve at any given time.  In the days when race, homosexuality, disability and other minority roles  were only found in the mainstream when the story was EXPLICITLY about that aspect of the character - SF (and fantasy) in contrast just included a range of characters (often as leads) without making it odd that they were there. Any examples I use will have flaws and often seem trite in retrospect,  I but I&apos;m just asking you to compare SF to mainstream at the times they were released.  Straw entity 1: Race. Consider the first televised interracial kiss (Star Trek); consider the Enterprise crew; consider the leads in Romero&apos;s early Zombie films (&apos;Night&apos; and &apos;Dawn&apos;); consider the cast of the Matrix series, Dr Who, Quantum Leap. Think about the genre that has made Will Smith and Wesley Snipes heroes for their characters NOT their race. I can go on but won&apos;t. Some times I suspect that SF/fantasy as a genre in the past has been one of the main areas that has kept the non-white TV actor population employed... in books it is harder to see this unless it is pointed out explicitly (e.g. if the race doesn&apos;t matter then you don&apos;t know), but again there are plenty of explicitly &apos;but it doesn&apos;t matter that they are&apos; black characters in SF even going back into the bad ol&apos; 50&apos;s :)  I could try the same for differently-abled characters, but I&apos;m not an expert on understanding when a genuine minority actor is not playing the role (e.g. Avatar) vs when they are (e.g. Aliens4, Game of Thrones). It is much easier for me to point out examples in literature - even OLD ones: Forever War, Non-stop, Flowers for Algernon etc.. Although I am falling into the trap that in some of these the &apos;disability&apos; is essential to the plot and is not just incidental. Homosexuality and transgender has a loooong history in SF/Fantasy and is still going strong (as pointed out for Dr Who and Torchwood - perhaps to the point of self pastiche!!). Perhaps it is sometimes a little heavy handed (Heinlein) or extreme (Farmer, Rice) but there are lots of more moderate examples where is is just a part of life (e.g. the Forever War again). Oops.. Sorry, getting a bit long here and reading back I can see even more flaws in the examples, but I still think that SF/Fantasy has a better than average track record. Not just as &apos;crumbs&apos; to minorities - because we all know that &apos;flints&apos; would be better there, but genuinely as an area of exploration or just simpy inclusion. Where we can even try &apos;Ok.. A and B are different people, but how will they cope with situation x where their differences are now trivial&apos;... Or am I rambling?  One problem might be that it is hard to get away from the &apos;difference&apos; between people being a plot point. If it is irrelevant that someone has two hearts - why mention it? I don&apos;t really characterise myself as my sex, gender, race or physical abilities when I read - for example, writing here, are any of these things really relevant? I&apos;ve never had blue skin and I am not hermaphrodite, but it doesn&apos;t mean that I cannot empathise with someone in a story, or post about / discuss a story character that has those attributes. I know we bring a lot of baggage to our lives from our past, but as someone brought up as (and by) a feminist pagan; it doesn&apos;t stop me being an atheist or reading sexist literature and being able to analyse it without anger, unless that&apos;s what lights your candle! ;Thanks for that, we seem to be like-minded (and equally long winded :) - I&apos;ve only a few mins now, but one thing you brought up is something that has bothered me for quite a while now: I don&apos;t mind what the Doctor&apos;s sexuality is (the boy/girl-flirting has been quite amusing); I&apos;m not toooo bothered that it seemed inconsistent (he&apos;s pretty whimsical generally); It DID disappoint me that he did the grabbing thing because it didn&apos;t fit; but what has perturbed me the most (really) was that he had any sexuality AT ALL!! I guess MY Doctor is competely asexual and only play-acts human interactions. After all, he&apos;s old enough to be their great-great-great-etc. I&apos;m guessing because I grew up with him and he&apos;s always been a kind-of teacher figure. But then his personal life started to intrude after Rose... :) I know every time there is a new Doctor the speculation is that they will be female/black (even back to Pertwee&apos;s time) but I can&apos;t see the trend of sexy young male doctors ending as long as the current writers are in charge (although I REALLY REALLY thought that River was going to turn out to be the Doctor when we first met her). OOps, gotta go... Sorry I&apos;m so off topic here... ;It will show you an X out of y done update as you go through.  I did 7 out of curiosity (about both the essays and the process) and it was still asking if I wanted to do 8 so it might be possible to do hundreds :). You get a positive non-specific reinforcement statement if you do more than 5 -  I do wonder how many alternatives there are before they repeat or if they are random.... ;I used 7 stories: 5 for / 2 against my thesis (one &apos;core&apos; in each: Rapunzel vs Sleeping Beauty) I was amused that one reviewer liked that I had used several stories vs one reviewer that said I had missed out the main stories (red cap, Hansel etc). I guess they balanced out :) It is what it is - a Scottish dance -  in peer review of this size we will get different partners next time. I would encourage people to write longer feedback. Some of mine were great (both of the reviewers mentioned above did a great job - even if I don&apos;t agree completely with one), but some were brief. I tried to put one positive comment, one critical but helpful (as suggested) and something in the last box.  If I was a course invigilator - I might use the peer reviewing element as equal weighting for each essay in my final mark. So it that case it would be prudent to consider the peer review as itself assessed (I&apos;m not sure that it won&apos;t be - so I&apos;m keeping my structure and word count up on that too :) Just a (conspiracy theory promoting) thought...  ;Having recently been through the trauma of being on both ends of a Human Resources PDPR (Personal Development Progress Report) launch - that&apos;s exactly how I saw it: 4=meets expectations.  Although we had much shorter % tails than here.. So we were guinea pigs for the launch rather than dormice I guess... ;Agreed - I do wonder how much of the party dress thing is because it is surreal - or because upper middle class girls in Victorian times were frequently dressed like dolls and probably didn&apos;t have many changes of clothes (if any). Since the Alice stories seem to mainly take place in a genteel garden party environment of a fairly posh house - I&apos;m going with the latter. ...anyway it&apos;s what is in Alice&apos;s head that matters to me as reader, not what she looks like.... ;I agree - looking glass (LG) is much richer and much more memorable.  Wonderland (W) in places feels like a rushed stream of upper middle class academic word games, mainly puns and double-ententres with a tacked-on ending (unless I am missing something and I&apos;m trying hard not to); whereas LG is more rounded and satisfying in my opinion, better paced and full of math/topology references, puzzles and generally somewhat wittier I think. I disagree that it is nonsense though - each set piece has a logical set of rules, but the language is deliberately designed to confound our expectations and send us off in unexpected directions. So, not nonsense but more dissonance..... ;There are some real examples of reversed causality in Alice where the pain appears before the prick, or the crime follows the punishment - and Carroll is clearly challenging our perception of time&apos;s arrow and emphasising the standard acceptance of physical laws. I suspect in your syllogisms above, the middle term is completely redundant (You&apos;d probably have to add &apos;Humans are the only animals that can speak&apos; and tweak a few more words ); but I see where you are going. Carroll seems to make the most of uni-directional logic and often tries reversing it to show how silly that is. I do have to agree that quantum theory produces all sorts of nonsense. If you don&apos;t read Alice, does the Cheshire Cat die? Oops - spilling over into quantum Peter Pan there for a moment... ;It wouldn&apos;t matter if you could leave pigs out in the middle (or have minus pigs, or fractional pigs, or even imaginary pigs :) - there is no mathematical / spatial solution because it is fixed by the 10. Nothing works.... ;p ;In order that professors and/or conspiracy theorists can later point out hidden images in the pictures (like cryptic frog genitalia)? Seriously, humans have a long history of &apos;easter eggs&apos;, hidden subversive images and intellectual games in picture form (e.g. the Mona Lisa). If the author and the illustrator are in cahoots or are identical then I suspect that this is more likely to happen. In my own head I boil this down to the human need to be part of the &apos;in-crowd&apos; - the cognescenti, the specially informed. This stretches from hidden symbolism in architecture all the way over to knowing the hidden moves in a video game. If you find them for yourself, you get an &apos;aha - I&apos;m smart, I&apos;m knowing, I belong&apos;; if you are told then you are &apos;part of the club,  privileged, initiated&apos;. Too cynical?;Yes I did enjoy them as a child, particularly the Walrus &amp; the Carpenter, Lion &amp; Unicorn and Jabberwocky (The latter being one of the few poems I memorised as a child - and yes, I still have it in there). I never saw the Disney film so my recollections are all from the book. I wasn&apos;t scared of the Q of Hearts and the beheading stuff because she was all just ineffective tantrum, but I do remember being scared of the &apos;things alive on the other side of the mirror&apos; and the whole Red King thing (whose dream is it). As for Enid Blyton - quite patchy generally, but The Secret Island was one of my most influential books as a child (almost equal to The Magician&apos;s Nephew - Probably my favourite children&apos;s book ever).  It wasn&apos;t until I was much older that I really appreciated Humpty Dumpty and the White Knight (who always reminds me of Don Quixote). ;It can go either way for me. In a book you are free to imagine for yourself many of the aspects, particularly the background, but in a movie you get to see someone else&apos;s imagination - both are good. It is interesting that a movie can sometimes change your view of characters in a sequel - Harry Potter did that for me where I saw the movie characters in later books; as did the Stand, on re-reading I &apos;saw&apos; (some of) the actors. Some authors fare well in screen and some don&apos;t. On occasion you get a prolific author that goes both ways. For me, King is such an example (purely IMHO - YMMV): The Shining is better in the book; Carrie is better in film; Firestarter and Christine I have problems remembering which is which in my memory.  I am very nervous of the up coming Enders Game film - a personal favourite and I hope they do it Justice. ;I very rarely get scared by films (believe me I have tried), but books can quite frequently do the job very well (and it doesn&apos;t matter if I&apos;m on my own in the dark for either so it is not the difference in environment). So, I believe I agree with King - thank you for that tidbit. MILD SPOILER: Ironically his books have never actually scared me, but just one of his films disturbed me quite badly and it was because of something not explicitly stated. In The Mist, when the big event happens at the end; I went back over all of the decisions that they had made throughout the film. Every single branch point, I agreed with their decision and probably would have done the same - they are sensible and rational, the alternatives are clearly bad. Except that every single one is exactly wrong.... given the &apos;final decision&apos; - that is scary. So I got scared, not by the actual events themselves, but by the discovery that they had serially tricked me and that I would have ended up in the same place... that&apos;s a very book-like effect and made it the only scary King for me. SPOILER END ;Guilty secret - I didn&apos;t really like Gatsby either, it&apos;s like Catcher in the Rye - I kept waiting for the big twist.... Rebecca on the other hand :) - Great book, decent films... ;For many years I have loved http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Company_of_Wolves . It is partially based on Red Riding Hood but has lots of sub-stories that are very Grimm.  Written by Angela Carter and directed by Neil Jordan it is IMHO a must see for anyone interested in Fairy Tales. BTW - Huge amounts of mature symbolic stuff in it about menarche and men as wolves etc :)  I&apos;ll duck the missiles, but I still think that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(film) is beautiful. Directed by Ridley Scott and with a very young Tom Cruise it is solid fairy tale stuff, again, lots of symbolism. ;Obviously we have the illustration which has to be taken as gOsPeL - so we can see how long the sword is and roughly what it looks like. Through and through suggests that this action matches the length of the blade. If it has to go all the way through the Jabberwock to the back. This means that it is an awfully long blade for the wielder since it is a wide-blade not a rapier or foil. It looks like the equivalent of a two-handed broadsword. This is probably confirmed by the bit of hand guard we can see (could be hair, but I don&apos;t think so). Now the person with the sword is not very muscular and appears to be a young person, probably a girl (although the poem does say he), so this blade has to be very light. It doesn&apos;t seem to be a samurai-style blade and given the line down the middle, doesn&apos;t appear to be especially thin - so it again has to be made of a very light material. (S)he is holding it in a manner that is going to be really hard to deploy overhead unless it is incredibly light - and she won, so presumably it really is almost weightless.  The noise &apos;snicker-snack&apos; sounds like scissors or possibly a very sharp blade on a crispy material, so I&apos;m going to consider the target.. The Jabberwock does have a waistcoat on ?!? and seems to have scales under (by extension of scales elsewhere) which would inhibit the blade. It also seems reptilian or at least vertebrate, so it is probably not hollow (like an insect, spider or most other invertebrates). That said, it has teeth and wings so I&apos;d suggest that it is possibly a pterosaur or equivalent proto-bird and may have hollow bones and reduced mass. It seems to be flying (or at last supporting itself on its tail) so that would seem to be confirmed even if the wings are not capable of full flight (doubtful) and are only used for speed (like archaeopteryx) or momentary height/rearing advantage. I am worried about six appendages (all of which seem derived from a pentadactyl limb form - 3 toes, 4 fingers, 5 wing-fingers) - but I&apos;m going with an homeotic mutation duplication on that since we have the precedent of the dragon (I suspect this is a subspecies of dragon). Possibly it would not be too hard to do &apos;through and through&apos; on a foe like this and it might be delicate/crispy enough to make a &apos;snicker snack&apos; sound as the small person whacks it. On balance, I suspect that the blade may very well be magically enhanced, but failing that - it is probably not as heavy as it looks; and the foe is probably not as heavy or fearsome as you might think from first impressions.  My personal speculation is that the vorpal sword is hollow and carved from a single feather, much like a quill pen - after all (apologies Stephanie)... The pen is mightier than the sword. ;Thank you for those kind words - keep them in mind if you ever see my essays ;pJust thought I should add that in &apos;reality&apos; I think that the illustration is almost certainly ironic.In my view - yes that&apos;s Alice with the b*****y great sword.She&apos;s imagining herself in the old poem which is clearly about a male juvenile hero (probably with bulging great muscles) heading off into the dark woods with his sword to fulfill his coming-of-age   (Freud anyone? Grimm anyone?).That sword is way too big for her (it&apos;s clearly a her) and it is clearly too heavy; those wings are also far too small for that thing to fly. She doesn&apos;t know how to handle the sword and is standing incredibly awkwardly (Gauche / naive).  So this is a cutesy picture of Alice imagining that she is a hero in a poem IMHO :) - who said she always had the dress on!;@Laurie - Thank you - much appreciated. Me neither actually - there&apos;s a lot of choice (although I think I&apos;m probably going for the Red King). @Stephanie - If you like realistic fantasy - K.J.Parker - Colours in the Steel (Fencer Trilogy 1.) is pretty inte;Thank you - I think I lean that way too. I wonder if the sword would be Vorpalescent to look upon? Things that make me go hmmm...: From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal : &quot;Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott&apos;s Anne of Geierstein in 1829, however, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott&apos;s novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott&apos;s novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.[26] Within a year of the publishing of Scott&apos;s novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next twenty years or so.[28]&quot; ;You probably already know this, but if not - you might like to read about the M vs Q effect: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/you-are-not-so-smart-why-we-cant-tell-good-wine-from-bad/247240/  It&apos;s (to my mind, but I&apos;m not a psychologist) similar/analogous to the boubakiki link (thanks for that BTW - it made me look at Jabberwocky again which is always nice :) .  In the Pepsi taste test where cups were labelled M &amp; Q, experimenters suggested that people chose some letters on cups over others regardless of the content. Bit sad for people called Quentin - although perhaps that is a bit of insight why more people have names beginning with M ! ;I&apos;ve been puzzling about the Crow in Tweedledum/dee. Does it appear because Alice wishes it; or is it the result of narrative inevitability because it was prophesied in the poem? If this is Alice&apos;s dream, then is she in charge or is she just a pawn? The (chess) rules are obviously guiding here; but is she assumed to be free to act and influence events? Her final moves are predicted, so is she completely bound by narrative cause and effect; and is this a reference to her being a character in a book? ;..the survival of the &apos;narrator&apos; is not always guaranteed either. I can think of quite a few books where the narrator is already dead, sublimed, unreal or even never born - including your &apos;MS found in a bottle&apos; style suggestion of an epilogue. The problem is that naming them would be a major spoiler to most of the ones I&apos;m thinking of - with the probable exception of Tristram Shandy which defies spoilers :) Personally I rather like successive 1st person - especially if they cover the same event from different perspectives - although I agree with most posters in not having a set preference. ;I really love the forever war by Joe Haldeman which is first person. On the other hand - one of the very very few SF books to ever gross me out so much that I couldn&apos;t actually finish was first person as well - I wonder if that is why :) - Crash by J.G.Ballard. ;Me too (three?) - I&apos;ve done a word cloud of the 10 essays that I saw (including mine) and it is not as clear as I thought it would be:;Reading these comments I&apos;m so glad I decided not to discuss childhood at all - not so say I did the right subject either in the end...  Almost all of my marking was about childhood too (I went higher this time as well - 8 - but stopped at 9 because I genuinely couldn&apos;t think how to comment on it). So I guess that&apos;s a consensus - these are books for children.... Perhaps after Grimm that was actually a relief to many people. I did see quite a bit of hostility towards the books and dismissive comments about the content in more than one of the essays that I marked; which surprised me (and squandered words). Most of this negativity was about Wonderland and I did (probably unfairly) wonder if some of the writers had got round to the second novel :) - if you didn&apos;t, then do try it because you might like it more. On balance, I thought the essays I marked were better for Grimm; and probably more interesting in the main. Personally I rather liked Looking Glass. So - next week - will it be 5 essays about dominance in sexuality? :) ;Megan - heh heh - yes I agree that&apos;s a front runner. Although my money is probably on the disconnect of the aristocracy from peasantry, changing social structures in contrasting societies, maybe even a little &apos;Droit du seigneur&apos;?  I haven&apos;t read Dracula since I was 12 so I&apos;m looking forward to starting. I have a very very long flight on Saturday so I&apos;m saving it until then; and my essay will probably then be about constraint, discomfort, claustrophobia, and journeys between different cultures where the upper classes have advantages not available to the cattle classes. Not that context influences readings at all :) ;In Brit-speak:  Marmalade is a citrus jam with peel in it and is bitter/sweet;  Jam is almost any fruit (or occasionally some vegetables) cooked with lots of sugar (usually not citrus but can be); Curd is jam with egg in it and is usually citrus (mmmm.. Lemon curd); Jelly is quite different and is basically solidified fruit juice - not usually very sweet. I agree about lime marmalade - mmmm.. In Victorian times I understand that quince was commonly used as well for marmalade - never tried it myself. Traditionally marmalade is commonly a breakfast thing, so the only symbol I can think is that she is falling away from the beginning/dawn of her day/life because the marmalade has already come and gone...!? ;I havent read these books but... I&apos;ve visited several archaeological sites in China and my impression is that Jade is most commonly associated with the aristocracy (so - no change there vampires=aristocracy); and grave goods. There were a lot of jade artefacts in the Ming tombs; and large valuable pieces of jade in the Forbidden City.  Some jade artefacts were more valuable than gold or silver and they would have been owned by the rich and powerful; my understanding is that they are commonly associated with long life (but IMHO most symbols and TCM are associated with long life in China - perfectly reasonably). As for secrecy, that&apos;s IMHO probably a hang over from the common western perception over many centuries that the East is mysterious and unknowable - pragmatically I think this is mainly a function of distance and unfamiliarity :) On the other hand, in western literature, jade is probably just a shorthand for China (somewhat unfairly to the Mayans and other Southern Americans because &apos;quetzal jade&apos; was just as important down there - it was in the tombs at Palenque for example). The other shorthand for China is Dragon, but I don&apos;t believe that dragons are really blood &apos;suckers&apos;, they certainly aren&apos;t sneaky in Welsh/English culture - very much in-your-face predators :). In China, there seems to be much more of a fusion of ghost/vampire than in Europe which might add to the secrecy thing? Sorry to focus on Chinese culture rather than Korea, Japan etc. but I&apos;ve only been to cities in those other places and I don&apos;t feel that I can comment on ancient/myth cultures there. ;That part about running water always used to amuse us as kids because Dracula would have such a hard time in any town or house with sewers or indoor plumbing.  The thing about the tides is interesting though - so moon position controls him? Or is it just that the water is still (as long as it is not too windy) and not running at high/low tide?. ;Possibly the easiest way to think about it is in a car.  You look in the rear-view mirror at the car behind. It uses its right indicators and they are on your right too. The driver is on the same side as you are. So left and right have not been reversed By using a mirror you are not reversing up and down (obviously); but you are not reversing left and right either, you are just showing a representation of what is behind you. Every point is mapped onto the image directly, the left stuff stays on the left.  But your brain says it is reversed and so you consider it as if you were looking through the mirror from the other side which is not the same at all. Try it with &apos;mirror writing&apos; - it is reversed right? Written from right to left..? Yes, but to read it, you have to show it to the mirror by reversing it first and showing the written side of the paper to the mirror (the blank side faces you). If you look THROUGH the paper it is both normal to you AND normal in the mirror. The reversing was in the way you handled the paper, not the imaging. Does that help? ;</string>
            <string>Sean, you have to explicitly check the box for conversion in the Options window for that to happen, right? Otherwise, won&apos;t the file just be sent in its native format?;Sean, I&apos;m not familiar with how things work on a Kindle Paperwhite, but what I did with my Dracula notes was to mount my Kindle on my Mac&apos;s desktop, copy the &quot;My Clippings&quot; file to the Mac, and then read them there with a text editor. Much easier than scrolling through them on the Kindle.;Hi, Sean. Sorry that the computer option won&apos;t work at the moment, but I envy you getting a chance to see Oz!;If it is the median then yes it could (and would also if it were the mean) but not necessarily:  11223 is the same median (2) as 112233 or 1122233.- although 111233 would conventionally be the mean of the two middle numbers = 1.5I do wonder what the drop-out on marking is?If they have gone from 4 to 5 that would suggest to me that there might have been quite a bit of drop-out last time.In a class this size there should be a reasonable  probability  that some rare people might get quite few marks, possibly very few.I wonder if they then get topped up by staff markers?If I was running it, I might welcome extra marking to cover some of that shortfall.It wouldn&apos;t be unreasonable to imagine that people that don&apos;t submit an essay might be less likely to submit marks so I might also pre-emptively add their allocation of essays to a pool that was picked up preferentially in the &apos;optional evaluation&apos; list.In the last day of marking I might add essays that had low numbers so far to that pool as well.Some people will mark same day, some will leave it to the last day - I&apos;m betting there might be a dip in between.;Ah - OK, fair point, I hadn&apos;t noticed that arrangement, but my mealy-mouthed &apos;wouldn&apos;t be unreasonable..&apos; covered that (by accident :)  Thanks.;Hannibal is very good and I&apos;m curious to know where it is going.  I&apos;m afraid though that my favourite serial killer is still Dexter - Hannibal has a long way to go to top him..  Hmm.. top him - that&apos;s a thought... Dexter vs Hannibal vs Dracula.. Actually... Doesn&apos;t Dexter strike you as a bit Van Helsing in some ways... ;Ducking the missiles, I actually quite like it this way round because I get to think about the book(s) - go off onto wild tangents and make my own decisions. Then I watch the videos and agree (or disagree) with them; and fairly often have an &apos;oh - I didn&apos;t think of that&apos; moment that I quite enjoy.  I&apos;m probably too easily influenced, but if I saw the videos first it might be harder for me to come to my own conclusions. If this was a science class then I agree that lectures first would be better (although - reading papers before a tutorial - hmmm...).  The bit I find hard is deciding on the theme of the essay because it seems very arbitrary - anything goes. That said, I presume that intellectual triage is one of the skills we are learning :)   I&apos;m also taking a &apos;purist&apos; approach and only using the current text and no outside sources (which would be considered wrong in all other courses I have taken) - I have no idea if that is the right thing to do but it means I get to do more thinking than researching - which feels right for me. I know how to research but I probably don&apos;t know how to think in this context and practice makes perfect  (10,000 hours apparently - mentioned in another thread and summarised here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)  ).I don&apos;t need any particular grades (although I&apos;m competitive enough to want good ones) - so I can understand how I might be more anxious about the structure if I thought that &apos;giving the right answer&apos; or &apos;matching the lecture&apos; would improve my grades.That&apos;s not meant to infer that  everyone who doesn&apos;t like the structure has that reason though - it&apos;s just the way that I think that I might think about it... - I think.  ;Unfortunately it has been very common in various types of literature that the character that has impure thoughts, even if those thoughts are essentially chaste but inherently imply a consideration of consummation - has to have a comeuppance - in extreme cases (or if they act on these thoughts), that means they must die*.  So I think Lucy is not really portrayed as pure. *There are lots of examples in books and films, so many that there are several parodies of this &apos;rule&apos; including Scream and Cabin in the Woods. ;The Americans in Mexico and Guatemala might disagree that displaying skulls is macabre, but I know what you mean. For that matter, relics are not unheard of in most Catholic countries - it is one of the most surprising things when you first visit a Catholic Church compared to those in Scandinava/UK. I&apos;ve never been in a Catholic Church in US/Canada - are there relics / explicitly tortured statues there? ;I have to admit that some of the statues I have seen in Catholic Churches are extremely graphic and quite shockingly grotesque. I&apos;m not a catholic, so I havent visited many, but over the last year I&apos;ve seen really nasty crucifixion tableaux in Puebla, Mexico and Vienna, Austria. If I&apos;d seen these as a child I would have had nightmares - but then I (cynically) guess this is the purpose. The relics and Mexican skulls seem gentle in comparison. ;No worries, mirrors are very very odd things that behave counter-intuitively and shows us things that we normally wouldn&apos;t see - no wonder we find them creepy as children (or is that just me :) ?).Grimm, Alice, Vampires, Frankenstein... OMG, mirrors are the continuing link for the course (or is it members of the crow family? ) - *joke*;&apos;Police&apos; and &apos;Ambulance&apos; would be written the correct way from the viewpoint of the police-car/ambulance driver if their bonnet was transparent and they were looking from the engine block. It is &apos;reversed&apos; to an observer looking at the front of their vehicle but correct to you in the mirror because it is behind you, and when you have &apos;turned-around&apos; to look at it head-on, you have then yourself reversed your own left and right.The glove thing - I only have  woollen  gloves and they are interchangable between hands because they are symmetrical - in fact my hands themselves are &apos;mirror-images&apos; of each other already.Say however that your hands are not  bilaterally  interchangable, like in Niven &amp; Pournelle&apos;s The Gripping Hand. Your left glove would not then become a right glove in the mirror... or would it?  I agree with anonymous 4 - llorraC siweL would have been very pleased with this - it is fun because it is a mentally elusive and counter intuitive situation.;Umm... I&apos;m just trying to help and explain here and the mass red-arrowing seems a tad excessive - but I will persevere.I&apos;m not a chirality denier - some of my favourite molecules are levorotatory - but it doesn&apos;t have anything to do with mirrors, they just rotate the polarisation of light in a different direction - calling them mirror-images is just a colourful description. I wasn&apos;t trying to get out of the glove experiment, I was just trying to ease into the observation that gloves are already roughly mirror images of each other (as are shoes). This is because we are evolved from bilateral animals. If you got a starfish to look in a mirror it would have a slightly different perspective. So using part of ourselves is misleading. If I wore a sandal on one foot and a boot on the other, the sandal does not become a boot in the mirror, it just becomes a sandal that looks like it would fit the other foot. I&apos;m not saying that it doesn&apos;t look like a right sandal, but it isn&apos;t one, - it&apos;s just a reflection of a left one and it is still on my left.The mirrors we are talking about reflect in a plane. If you think of the mirror plane as being x,y then all of the positions on our side of the mirror (+z) are imaged as on the other side of the mirror (-z). Their x and y positions are not substantially changed (with some allowance for our limited binocularity, foreshortening and distortion - no mirror or eye is perfect).Your left hand or foot does not &apos;become&apos; a right hand or foot in the mirror, nothing is turned around. If it was then if we walked to our left, our reflection would walk to our right, instead - it also walks to our left. If you and I stand next to each other and look in the mirror, we are not Tweedledum and Tweedledee, we are (presumably) different. I am standing on your left, but I don&apos;t become you and you don&apos;t become me in the mirror. You and your reflection are both still on my right.  I&apos;m not sure why you say that it is a &quot;faulty argument about direction indicators not being reversed when seen in a rear-view mirror&quot; - I may be completely missing the issue you have with my posts. What do you actually think I have said that is wrong or offensive to you? If I have offended you somehow then I am sorry (if you are anon1 then I don&apos;t think I was actually disagreeing with you).;Hello anonymous 1/7 - good to see you back :)  - exactly - I was really talking about the meaning of &apos;reverse&apos; in this context (...and we are back to Humpty Dumpty and ontologies :) . Hmm I wonder if it is a coincidence that rever -se starts with a palindrome??Anonymous 6 - (who I don&apos;t think is 5) - I agree with you, you are right I was sloppy with my statement about chirality - it does have an element of mirror-symmetry in the position of at least the major components (not necessarily all the way up to DNA sequence or all the way down to subatomics - it is not mathematical chirality but a reasonable approximation); However, I was really trying to bring us back to the discussion about mirrors and their images - not physical entities - which is why I said chirality had nothing to do with mirrors (in the noun-sense not the verb- sense).To be a bit Humptyish here - The trunk of an elephant, the trunk of a human, and the trunk of a tree are not the same things, but the word has the same origin and the same meaning at some levels but not others.   Mirror-images are not always images in mirrors (!).Two ironic things about all of this are that the image that we see in a mirror (as with everything else we see) passes through the (pin-hole-like) lens of our eye and is inverted up/down and left/right; but our brain knows this and corrects it - or rather is already used to it. Also, part of the visual field from each eye (left and right) in binocular vision travels along nerves to the opposite side of the brain which physically inverts it again (left to right) but again our very early childhood visual experience sorts all that out for us.  BTW - This last paragraph has NOTHING to do with mirrors (except in the &apos;reversing&apos; colloquial verb sense) but I thought it was worth saying, especially considering how the image in a concave mirror would look on our retinas :)@Claire-Louise - thank you very much :);Here is mine too, I got a 4 - I&apos;m pretty OK with that - but want to do better of course...(!).The reviewers gave some useful comments (I tend to say less than 1 but more than the others). I was especially pleased with &apos;charming&apos;.If any of them are you, then thanks :)Last time I thought I had tried to do too much, this time I suspect it is a one-trick-pony :)==============In theatre, the players may break the &apos;fourth wall&apos; by addressing the audience and reminding both parties that the play is a scripted fantasy. The Alice books [1,2] promote the same effect but in a more subversive and layered manner which pulls the viewer deeper into the dream.  The narrative is a &apos;Russian Doll&apos;, with layers of reality and story. Carroll relates the story of Alice, telling a story to her sister [3], about telling a story to her cat [4], about going through the mirror [5]. Diving deeper, Alice then recalls the story of Tweedledum and Tweedledee [6] and gradually enters the poem; blurring the line between story and her current reality. The twins in their own turn add story layers with the Walrus &amp; the Carpenter [7] and introduce the Red King&apos;s dreams (stories) [8]; which they insist are of Alice, and which comprise her own reality.At this point, the perception of structured layers of reality suddenly collapses or inverts; and by analogy the fourth wall, the mirror, is shattered. The reader is suddenly reminded that Alice is not in the Red King&apos;s dreams, nor is he in hers; but in &apos;reality&apos; they are both figments of Carroll&apos;s imagination (who is a figment of Dodgson&apos;s).   Perhaps the Red King is Dodgson - the ultimate controller (dreamer) of the story?Or perhaps we can elevate that thought yet another level and leave the social mirror of the written page to become &apos;transcribed&apos; into the mind (dream) of the reader. By extension they (or more accurately - I) have now &apos;become&apos; the &apos;Red King&apos; since I am now &apos;dreaming&apos; Alice et al, constructing their immediate reality this very moment as I read and actively re-write their story in this essay.Although... now you have read this analysis; it has entered your own mind; you are considering the story.. Surely.. Now you are the Red King?===Bibliography.[1] Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll.  [2] Through the Looking Glass - Lewis Carroll.Citations: Alice - Through the Looking Glass:[3] &apos;When she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister&apos; - Chapter 12.[4] &apos;How would you like to live in Looking-Glass House kitty?&apos; - Chapter 1.[5] &apos;In another moment Alice was through the glass&apos; - Chapter 1.[6] &apos;The words of the old song kept ringing through her head&apos; - Chapter 4.[7] &apos;They were both very unpleasant characters&apos; - Chapter 4.[8] &apos;If he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you&apos;d be?&apos; - Chapter 4.===FORM=== (2)peer 1      A test grammatical level seems spelled correctly. When you refer to the &quot;fourth wall&quot; denotes knowledge of theatrical staging. Referring to the &quot;&apos;Russian Doll&apos;&quot; makes a perfect mental image on reading levels have the Alice books, as if it were a spiral that leads to a deeper point and central to the story. Both the fourth wall concept as the roller coaster are safe to amalgamate the main argument of this essay, which is to contain stories that another story and it just breaks the cycle when the work Alicia wakes his reality.peer 2      This is nicely written. I think it would have been easier to understand if you had taken a little more time to paraphrase the sections you were talking about rather than footnoting direct quotes -- but that may have been very difficult within the word limitations.peer 3      The form you used in the essay looks good. You summed up used words and statements in the essay according to your approach. In the end, I liked your essay in the form light.peer 4      The essay had a good form. No complaints.===CONTENT=== (2)peer 1      I think the argument is very clear. The allusion to the structure where each character gives rise to a new story without departing from the main, while creating a kind of spider web in which one falls reader feeling like part of the story. The question whether we are the &quot;Red King&quot; that still dreaming and creating more characters that nurture story reveals the character reader feeling Carroll manages to convey. The word count limit imposed trials an extra challenge to condense into 320 words maximum is two-edged weapon, can be confusing concepts when writing or not allow deep approach of the work. Despite this I consider it a very good essay.peer 2      Very nice idea, well-argued. You get a little convoluted yourself as you turn everyone into the Red King, but that may be entirely warranted in context.peer 3      Your essay   s content brings shades different light to topic. When we re-read with your essay in mind we may see the story somewhat different. In the end, I think you did a good job. Thanks.peer 4      The topic of the essay was amazing and very creative. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.===EXTRAS===peer 1      I like the way it describes the history levels Alicia. I hope my comments serve to keep learning in this wonderful course.peer 2      This is a charming essay. I love the idea of the fourth wall and its convolution! I&apos;ve read Alice a hundred times, and I am always glad to see a new thing in it.;I&apos;m not sure these would make me reach for the 1 (I am probably under % for that) but these damage the essay IMHO:It&apos;s not all about youI want to know your opinion of course; and your special insights.But it&apos;s not all that useful to spend a paragraph on how much you dislike this novel - because I just can&apos;t mark that. It is even harder if you write about how this interacts with something personal in your life. I&apos;m marking the essay not you.The logic difficult and sentences to follow it isI will try very hard to understand what you are saying but if I cannot work out what the point is; or if it is so convoluted that I get lost in the meaning then I have to assume that it is not a finished essay.Saying the same thing saying the same thing saying the same thing many times.I want to know why you think that and what evidence or other examples you have. It is only a short essay and I do read every word so I will notice if you say the same thing with the words in a slightly different order or using synonyms.;I think there is a lot of personal religion, but little church (organised religion) except in some of its secondary symbols. The effectiveness of belief and &apos;personal ministry&apos; is emphasised much more than the clergy - they actually explicitly promote themselves as gung-ho crusader knights.  ;A you might be interested in an old film comedy - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061655/ The Fearless vampire Killers - by Roman Polanski that confronts the problem of a Jewish Alfie Bass becoming a vampire (the crucifix doesn&apos;t work any more).  ;Yes - on balance I prefer the original to the remake but the remake is growing on me.IMHO the biggest difference in in &apos;Spirit of Man&apos; where I really like the original voices more.I haven&apos;t seen the stage show but i have heard very good reports.  ;Yes that irritated me too.. Unless that whole rigmarole of getting to the castle the first time means that it cannot be approached directly without Dracula&apos;s direct intervention (or death)?   Perhaps it is like Brigadoon and the castle only appeared / could be entered on select occasions... Otherwise why the round and round with the flames (the explanation given was highly suspect). ;Ahh.. Well, history is written by the winners. Dracula was just a misunderstood foreigner run out of town based on a lot of supposition and prejudice. He just happened to be in the wrong places at the wrong times and was haunted/pestered by those awful vampire women that did all the actual damage. Just because no one saw them in the UK..... A tragedy of stereotyping based on physiognomy and assumption. ;I don&apos;t think anyone has mentioned it (BTW is there a way to subscribe to all threads and their subthreads at once?) but I laughed out loud at the weird out of place Shakespearian-like comedy interlude in Chapter 24. Mina is reporting Van Helsing&apos;s misunderstanding of the Clerk&apos;s report of the Czarina Catherine&apos;s Captain&apos;s robust conversation with Dracula about his getting passage to run away. So far so confusing.. ... but it is the misquotes that made me laugh. Especially as Mina was reporting it so po-faced and Van Helsing is clearly not getting it, and it is so well themed for the book but so strangely PG13: &quot;Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood&apos;  &apos;He doesn&apos;t want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship with blood on her also&apos; These two I translate as: &apos;You&apos;d better be bloody quick, my ship leaves this bloody place before the turn of the bloody tide&apos;  and  &apos;I don&apos;t want no blooming bloody Frenchmen in my bloody ship&apos; ....and it goes on for a page or so... I&apos;m at a bit of a loss however, to account for &apos;polyglot&apos;, especially within the sentence: &quot;The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood&quot;  I can guess, but I can&apos;t substantiate it....  ;Still racking my brains - at the moment I favour:  ---bzzzztt - untranslatable-- I&apos;ve found settling on the topic harder each week - this week ended up as a toss between &apos;moon vs sun&apos; imagery (weight of notes) or &apos;blame it all on Lucy&apos; (moment of inspiration). I&apos;ve run out of personal time so Lucy got it in the neck. Good luck with the &apos;rude mechanicals&apos; :) ;@Megan I&apos;m intrigued - please do post when the hurly-burly&apos;s done.. I&apos;m speculating about myths of riding horses and pulleys because I can&apos;t see anything else there.. :) . ;My favourite Bradbury is not being covered - &apos;The fruit at the bottom of the bowl&apos; - curiously though it is awfully Poe like :) ;There are a lot of references to other literature in Dracula. Several to Shakespeare: Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello. Poems: &apos;Painted ship upon a painted ocean&apos; - loc 1199, ancient mariner. &apos;Casabianca&apos; - loc 1261, the boy stood on the burning deck. ...even references to current events like the &apos;famous burglar&apos; reference. So - why? Familiarity? Credentials? Association? It happens in &apos;modern lit&apos; and I just don&apos;t get it - because it breaks you out of the story it seems disruptive and unnecessary. I know it implies a lot of prepackaged symbolic baggage and shorthand referential stuff from other books (building on the shoulders of giants), but it can date a book quite badly. ;Pantomime writing :)  although I&apos;ve enjoyed the odd Panto in my time!  I did wonder if it had anything to do with his job and if I was missing a load more theatrical references - quite a bit did feel written for the stage (especially the humourous Captain interlude with blood ;p ) - but I might have been imagining that. ...exit followed by vampire bear. ;Sorry, I really couldn&apos;t see any male homosexuality although there were plenty of situations where I was expecting it (especially in the castle). Not much in the way of female homosexuality either really - unless you read an awful lot into the early letters between Mina and Lucy. All the vamp on human stuff was hetero (even the kids - apart from one called an it throughout, the rest were boys).  Not even any innuendo with the various sailors and yokels... I was actively looking (after seeing the earlier post about it) and I was rooting for Van Helsing to come out, but this novel seems very sexual and entirely straight to me. Happy to be proven wrong though. ;I agree with Kristine, I didn&apos;t see any evidence of penetration of men by Dracula or even hints.  Neither Renfield or Harker were bitten AFAIK - I still can&apos;t see any reason to differentiate between simple personal dominance or possibly hypnotism (same ballpark concept) vs homosexuality in this novel for those guys. I will follow up on those refs though. ;I saw Renfield as obsessive compulsive with an case of extreme hero worship or cult worship. I really didn&apos;t get the impression that he had been bitten. He had already moved from fly to spider to bird by July and was moving on to want a cat before Dracula even came to shore in earlyAugust.  BTW - anyone noticed this? Fancy that - he wanted a cat, he wanted the cat to follow the bird [how absurd]; he wanted the bird to follow the spider; he wanted the spider to follow the fly - I don&apos;t know why he wanted the flies - they foreshadowed his death :) - Good job there were no dogs, cows or horses available to him!! Back to Renfield - he seemed to detect Dracula around 19th August and went calm with a &apos;religious mania&apos;. Even when he escaped I don&apos;t see any suggestion of biting, just worship of D because he was already primed to be that way. I think this was a charisma cult or personality thing not necessarily psychic - more Crowley or Manson-family-like than magical. I did think that the sniffing was interesting - suggesting &apos;mad-wolf&apos; pheromones (?!? ) to me. Or something similar that made a lunar-tic obey a dominant wolf. I don&apos;t think Renfield needed to be bitten, just dominated. ;My knee-jerk reaction was that the deaths of the sailors would not be evidence of homosexuality because we have to wait until the Hollywood of the 80s and 90s for homosexual to become synonymous with homicidal. However, Dracula clearly had a period of blood lust resulting in an orgy of death on that ship, and we all know that the book makes close links between carnal and carnivore so I&apos;m not dismissing it.  In my head the logic goes a bit like this: Penetrating the skin non-lethally (PSN) is a symbol for subversive sex. Dracula&apos;s PSN on Lucy and Mina gives them vampiric STDs (which is itself eventually lethal) therefore this is doubly sexual. The weird sisters wish to PSN Harker therefore this is a sexual interaction also. However, Renfield kills spiders. Van Helsing et al kill Lucy. Dracula kills the sailors. - killing per se is not sexual. Even if Dracula is prone to PSN, it doesn&apos;t mean that killing is synonymous with PSN activity. I know it is obvious, but not everything a homosexual person or character does is necessarily a homosexual act; sometimes a homosexual person can make a cup of tea in a non-sexual way. I&apos;m still not convinced that Stoker&apos;s Drac is a gay icon; but even if he were, I&apos;m not persuaded by these killings (even if they are sailors and Stoker is aiming for a &apos;stranger things happen at sea&apos; theatre innuendo). The shaving blood is a bit harder - I have to read it again but I do remember it as showing desire for blood which was resisted by Dracula. So, is this a food thing or a sex thing? It&apos;s not sexual for Harker, he is not tempted but is simply under threat of becoming prey. Dracula is more ambiguous and if I was being devil&apos;s advocate and accepting the vamps as always homosexual icons, I could equally put forward a homophobia model. Consider the suggestion that Dracula is tempted by the blood but repelled by the fact that it is on a male. Dracula would seem to be happy to penetrate women (weird sisters) - although we don&apos;t actually formally know that they didn&apos;t turn Dracula (or were possibly all infected by a third party). But he doesn&apos;t penetrate Harker - why not? He abandons him, so he is clearly not needed for business reasons. He just doesn&apos;t find him attractive..... In this homophobia model, the book is about homosexual vampires, but to be honest I&apos;m still not persuaded. ;..and if you want to try something even more extreme then take a look at Philip Jose Farmer&apos;s Image of the Beast and its sequel Blown Good luck in finishing them - you&apos;ll need a strong constitution. ;I don&apos;t think we have to agree with the premise of the essay (or at least that&apos;s how I&apos;ve been marking). After all, I don&apos;t have to agree with the premise of the novel, or even like it (I&apos;m thinking of a later book, not Dracula); and if the essay points out a topic that I don&apos;t favour, it may be accurate or insightful so that wouldn&apos;t detract from the mark either. Any essay that makes me go back and look (or even think back) has enriched my reading. This thread for example has made me consider the possible homosexual content of Dracula and has enriched my reading. I still don&apos;t see evidence for it but it made me think. If someone wrote an essay on anti-Semitism in the novel I think there may be stronger evidence but I don&apos;t think it is an anti-Semitic novel. Writing about the search for homosexuality or homophobia in Dracula seem equally valid as each other to me because of the Stoker/Wilde thing but I still don&apos;t think it is a homoerotic novel (unlike most vampire books as was pointed out). If someone wrote an essay about Dracula as a god, alien, or time travelling lord of darkness and it was written persuasively or internally consistent then I can conceive that it would be a good essay.  On the other hand, I do wonder if markers will align scores with personal beliefs. what if an essay was blasphemous, or misogynist - or pointed out that Grimm was a white supremacist manual - if your beliefs misaligned, would you give a good mark ? ;p ;It is the same here - looks like Bram Stoker by Terry Gilliam. BTW - I am completely unconvinced by that article, it uses a lot of trigger words at the beginning and reads like wish-fulfilment of supposition based on supposition. While I would be fascinated if Stoker was gay, this is not even rumor-level evidence. I&apos;ll try to find the original but if those are the most persuasive passages then that sounds like more of the same. You could use the same evidence to suggest that Stoker was a secret satanist - thanks for the link though. ;</string>
            <string>Sorry to come back to an old thread, but I came across a classic old poem that we learned at school (teenage) and had to analyse. It was written in 1858 around 40 years after the first Grimm edition: The Haystack in the Floods by William Morris. I remembered the violence in it but forgot just how modern it feels.  I thought it added to my Grimm thoughts, and the violence in art and Alice thread - so I have linked it: http://www.netpoets.com/classic/poems/046003.htm ;I would rather say that gender and age do not necessarily determine writing prowess (statistically yes but there are always outliers - e.g. Matthew Lewis - the Monk, Jane Austin). However, popular as travelogues and character biographies were at that time, I did find all the purple sightseeing stuff was making me doze off. It&apos;s a fusion novel not pure horror/fantasy so the flowery bits may seem overlong to some sensibilities (like mine). Without being patronising, I think she did a great job (with blood) to write something that we still hold up as a classic today - how many of her older peers did the same ?! ;...did you see &apos;confinement&apos; as well as &apos;labour&apos;? :) ;Yes!!! Exactly... After all that build-up, long term plans, frenetic researching, eureka moment, delving in flesh sources.. He takes one look at the end result and goes. Didn&apos;t occur to him along the way, didn&apos;t think about the consequences, didn&apos;t happen 5 mins earlier... I initially thought it just showed how bad Shelley was at understanding and presenting realistic motivations; then I considered it to be a lack of understanding about science and scientists (they do things on a whim don&apos;t they ? - because they are essentially flighty and whimsical to their very core - Bwahahahahahahaaaaa I have created life, now I will develop fusion power...).  Lastly I have come to the conclusion that this simply cannot be expected to be taken as realistic and just has to be symbolic and/or an analogy - Ta Dah! - essay fodder...! I&apos;ve had all 4s so far, so I&apos;m rolling the dice on this one. ;Yes, that (and your other two posts today) coincide quite significantly with the basis for my essay that I wrote yesterday . Oh well, I&apos;m not working it up again - so it has to stand as deployed :) I was perhaps also thinking a touch more literally about the power placed in a teenagers hand... ;I like the &quot;distinction between unimportant swearing and important references to blood&quot; - clever! - I enjoyed this, hope it was well marked. If I was marking it I might be puzzled about the last sentence and the appearance of the &apos;soul of the ship&apos; and wonder if I was missing a pun... Something about being turned with the tide Perhaps :) ... I do believe I get it though. ;When they discussed William having &apos;one or two little WIVES&apos; with his favourite Louisa Biron (Hmmm... B(y/i)ron - coincidence - I think not!!) being &apos;five years of age&apos; [p31] - I assumed he must be a similar age, probably not more than one year either way and I would guess he was 6. ;It is a very interesting topic. Of course both the essays and reviews are anonymous (as are some of these posts), so that actually increases the chances of people expressing prejudice. On the other hand, traditionally this kind of academic exercise is pursued by a predominance of individuals who would normally be considered &apos;left-wing&apos;. So I would expect that e.g. homosexuality would not be high on a list of taboo subjects for most people here. On another hand (I&apos;m becoming Ganesh here) religion might possibly be a little more sensitive, or paedophilia, or coprophilia, or torture, or misogyny, or colonialism, or racism. Especially if condoned or presented sympathetically in an essay... Personally I intend to mark everything objectively according to their form and content even if I thoroughly disagree with the premise, otherwise I would lose my personal integrity. One cautionary thought that I do have is that a few times I have seen essays that leave the text entirely and become largely about personal belief - I would never give a 3 to an essay like that. Everyone has taboos - some of us actively push ourselves to find out what they are, others (equally validly) keep to what we were brought up with. F/SF is a great area for exploring this limit. Here are some SF books by well-known authors that challenged my limits (I&apos;m going out on a limb a bit here), I would be interested in other people&apos;s equivalents: Crash - J. G. Ballard  Beauty&apos;s Punishment - Ann Rice (under pseudonym - Roquelaire)  Blown - Phillip Jose Farmer ;Which Heinlein? I&apos;ve only read about 60% of his novels. Found him arguably a bit sexist (I will fear no evil); culturalist (day after tomorrow); racist (Farnham&apos;s Freehold) - but none to an unbearable level (yes I will say - considering when they were written). Not particularly subversive... So I&apos;m curious. Thanks for the others, I will look them up (always like to test my boundaries)! ;The doctor refers to &apos;him&apos; a few seconds before Van Helsing uses &apos;it&apos; and it is consistent so it does seem to be accent-based - he does some weird things with language. Perhaps also, Van Helsing is not the paternal type? ;The wolf was called Bersicker - he was in a cutting from the PALL MALL GAZETTE. ;I actually just assumed that they were smaller because women&apos;s jaws and teeth tend to be smaller than men&apos;s. Also, jaw shape/size and tooth size changes on average across Europe (I am led to believe that some Polish people have a traditional nickname of &apos;horse-faces&apos; for the North-Western Europeans). Drac&apos;s &apos;chin was broad and strong&apos; - p21, and I am willing to bet that Lucy&apos;s was petite... ..and yes, this assumes the kids were bitten by beautiful (bloofer) Lucy, which I agree is strongly indicated (and doesn&apos;t bloo-fer look awfully like blood-fear or am I reaching here :) ;I knew an upper middle-class English Mina very well some years ago (we shared a car crash); so I can authoritatively confirm that the culturally correct pronunciation is mean-uh - the same way as pronounced for the ending of Wilhelmina. The prof uses Mina as in minor or Mynah bird which Is a US form (and coincidentally fits better with the concept of small). I guess it might be possible that the Texan called her Mynah but he would have been corrected I suspect. ;You are right I was wrong, he says it like in minnow - I coulda swore.... :) I checked out a clip on YouTube and the Winona Rider Mina is pronounced like my friend - mean-uh. http://youtu.be/_OFfuZY_Pvk ;I too think that peer 1 was overly harsh and may have settled on a mindset that leaked unreasonably into content. The grammar IS imperfect and there are several points that could easily be typos (immerse[d], close[d], journ[ey]al, normally [not] be omitted, [it] makes, etc) but I might have pointed these out as proof reading issues instead. ;I agree with Florencia in general and peer 5 to a certain extent although they (5) were a little picky.  To be even pickier:  Humans and modern apes are both phylogenetically apes and both evolved from earlier common ancestor apes.  Evolution is indeed very often about predator/prey co-selection (topically: The red Queen effect where each is running as fast as they can to stay in the same place wrt catching vs escaping).  Being the &apos;fittest&apos; sometimes, for some species, means doing things that appear evolutionarily &apos;retro&apos;: Land mammals -&gt; Whales; Winged birds -&gt; Flightless birds; Toes -&gt; Hooves; Sexual reproduction -&gt; asexual. A beast-man might indeed be fitter in some environments.  Most transformations (mutations) are less fit, many are neutral and can stick around, a few are advantageous (now, or later) - some changes are selected for and then selected against in subsequent generations. I could go on with counter examples, but the point I am trying to make is that you don&apos;t actually need to be familiar with neutral mutation theory to simply suggest evolutionary pressures in an essay of this type. I think the original essay had adequate shorthand phrases about evolution for the purposes here.  ;Here&apos;s mine, please don&apos;t be gentle with me :) I tried something quite different (for me) this time, provocative and doing a character rather than a theme/structure. I was slightly weirded out by 1,2,3 commenting on form/content and not &apos;other&apos;; but 4 only commenting on other (and a bit crossly I believe - 2x1&apos;s perhaps ;p ). My direct response to 4 might be yes and yes but the point was not what &apos;we&apos; think but what was acceptable behaviour in a Victorian novel; Specific thanks to 1 - I should have been tighter about Othello but again, being sexual/killed/dominated was a more vital comparison in my head because again it was about echos into the Victorian sensibility that I was aiming for. I need to pay more attention to the setup of argument I think. === Grade:4  Lucy Westenra - did she fall, or was she pushed? When we first meet Lucy she is writing a sexually charged letter about her new beau. She mentions undressing (albeit in a chaste context), blushing, and practicing poses. By her second letter she is upping the ante, bragging about her attractiveness to three men, and referencing Othello [1]. This literary allusion foreshadows her own sexualised death and prompts us to question her complicity in the coming degradation. She is subsequently penetrated by one man (Dracula); and invaded (symbolically raped non-consensually with needle and blood) by three more. Stoker even permits Van Helsing to joke to John, that Lucy the polyandrist (twice now: once in thought and once in deed) serially cuckolded Arthur [2]. Her reputation is systematically shredded by both major and minor characters - amongst them a symbolic sexualisation by (dead) suicide Geordie [3]. So it is not surprising that she has to die - narrative Victorian determinacy dictates that she has &apos;fallen&apos;. Mina compares Lucy to Ophelia [4]; another Shakespearean double-ententre indicating that Lucy deserves to be pillioried, but instead receives flowers [5]; and later relates the moment of Lucy&apos;s &apos;fall&apos; to Van Helsing. Her linked diary entry alludes to the &apos;original apple&apos; [6]; albeit formally directed at herself but condemning Lucy by association. However, Lucy&apos;s &apos;fall&apos; is contrived. Her sex-talk at the beginning seems naive and somewhat gauche; Dracula attacks her whilst asleep; and she is unknowingly impregnated (transfused) with blood. Even when molesting the (male) children and displaying her wantonness [7], Stoker partially redeems her behaviour by reference to the unconscious nature of her activities [8]. Lucy sleepwalks throughout her &apos;fall&apos; with as little attention or caution as she originally gave to the potentially disastrous (in fictional terms) emotional connection with three men. Stoker manipulates these cryptic flaws beneath her superficially virtuous demeanour; and relentlessly pushes her character until it tumbles over the edge. Cited:  [1] &apos;I sympathise with poor Desdemona&apos;. - p65. [2] &apos;this so sweet maid is a polyandrist&apos; - p189. [3] &apos;poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin&apos; on his lap&apos;. - p75. [4] &apos;like Ophelia in the play&apos; - p144.

FORM  peer 1     Your writing is strong and you make some very good points. I like the way you note them and you say a lot in such a short essay, but I&apos;m not clear on your conclusion. It doesn&apos;t seem to make a clear point.  peer 2     This essay excels in terms of form, for, besides using words properly and respecting grammar rules, it also presents the thesis in a clear way. Comparing to other essays, a benchmark would be the terseness achieved by the use of chosen words which express exactly the meaning of the author&apos;s idea.  peer 3     Yes the words are used correctly and the essay is grammatically correct. The argument of Lucy being a symbolic sexual object is also well laid out with passages from the story to support this thesis. Very informative. CONTENT peer 1     You make many interesting points, although some I disagree with. Desdemona, for instance, represents an innocent being killed over sexual jealousy not merely a &quot;sexualised&quot; death. By ignoring the element of innocence, which would counter the point you were making, it weakens the argument, More importantly, it is difficult to present a dual argument and not just leave the reader with just as many questions as before. You need to wrap up your thoughts into a clear point to strengthen your writing.  peer 2     This essay shows an in-depth analysis of Lucy&apos;s character, noting not only her ostensive sexuality, but also her naivet   in displaying it.  peer 3     Yes, the sexualization of Lucy throughout the story is definitely very clear. OTHER peer 4     Some points for your consideration:- Paragraph 1 - When a woman talks about her love, it is not unnatural for her to blush. When she receives not one but multiple love proposals in a day, it is also not unreasonable for her to feel overwhelmed. What is it about Lucy&apos;s blushing and reaction towards the proposals of the three men that make her so different from a reasonable woman of a similar stature? Paragraph 2 - Rape has a negative overtone in its original meaning - being violated and assaulted by rapist who desires to dominate, control and destroy against the woman&apos;s will for his personal gratification. In the case of Lucy&apos;s blood transfusion, there is no such intent. The transfusion was motivated by a desire to save Lucy&apos;s life. It was a noble act, albeit performed against her knowledge. We cannot prove that it is against her will because had she been conscious she might have agreed to undergo the transfusion. ;Thank you both for excellent comments, all comments and nitpicking welcomed :) @Mary - yes - the desecration that made her less bloofer (I&apos;m reading kids dialect: beautiful); and the sleepwalking father smacks head :) . You&apos;ve encouraged me to be even more provocative for Frankenstein (so it&apos;s your fault if I shock anyone :) @Jeremy - very helpful. I did see Ra too, I like the Lucifer connection though. Entendre was a typo (smacks wrist) - I know better. I agonised over the order of Victorian N determinacy and went with the one that weighted best in my head (I&apos;m probably wrong). With the 3 donors I was trying to echo the 3 suitors so it was a 3+1 ( van Helsing was also somehow different ) but I take the point and should have noted this. The penultimate paragraph grammar thing is indeed awkward and easy to fix - good point! Thank you both for your time, much appreciated. Sean ;I agree with a proviso - on an iPad this is a bit dangerous. On the iPad, line breaks are often lost when you Add Comment or Submit; and you frequently get one paragraph (on the forum too). All the formatting things are greyed out on MD, but if you choose the Rich format option then sometimes the editing freezes and you lose everything. I&apos;ve also had the page crash completely on changing between MD and Rich.  I can write HTML but it is a lot more work... The easiest solution I have found is using  a double return to make paragraphs - on top of the normal return. Then when one goes AWOL, the others remain. ;Yes, Young Frankenstein - one if the most quotable films ever, now put.. the candle.. BACK! ;I&apos;ll prepare to be blown out of the water but.... I think there are a lot of Frankenstein themes carried across to &apos;Of Mice and Men&apos;. Obviously there are limits - the &apos;monster&apos; isn&apos;t created and he is not smart, but the same stories of prejudice and misunderstanding based on physical issues; and the &apos;proof&apos; that they were actually not un-reasonable after all. It seems a little like the result you might get from someone being told the story of Frankenstein without reading it :) ;If I remember correctly it was someone asking if anyone else was younger than they were. I believe they were 14.  It stuck in my mind because it made me wonder if I should moderate my book recommendations - then I remembered that I read some of them when I was that age :) - Books don&apos;t have any age restrictions where I lived and I remember reading lots of stuff that I would never have been allowed to watch on TV or film. I wish there was an option to be auto subscribed to everything and opt OUT rather than in - because I miss stuff when I am restricted to checking in by email (to do forum reading triage when I&apos;m on a break :)  ;I think I see what you mean, if you read midsummer nights dream as a teen (as we did at 13) and then read it again a few years later - it becomes quite a different play. Although even at 13 we knew it was not just about fairies, we definitely knew that the mechanicals were extremely rude. It is also worth noting that with time comes experience; even if that is only in the trivial sense - I certainly understood more about books based in a place when I had actually visited that place (however, Piccadilly Circus now is quite different to the Piccadilly Circus of the Triffids;  Steinbeck&apos;s Cannery Row has changed a bit too; as has Ballard&apos;s Singapore).  Although saying that - I&apos;m not 8ft tall but I can still appreciate the monsters viewpoints so direct experience is not always essential. I&apos;m always going back to stuff and realising how superficial I was &apos;last time&apos; (especially these essays :) - I&apos;m not sure that it is just age, probably the difference between fast reading and slow reading makes a difference more than anything (which is pretty new to me too). ;Not all Percy Shelley is hard..  This is the last part of his poem &apos;the cloud&apos; - I&apos;ve loved this since school and it is very readable by a modern audience I believe. It also deals with birth/death/birth and eternal life through &apos;spirit&apos;: I am the daughter of Earth and Water, And the nursling of the Sky; I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; I change, but I cannot die. For after the rain when with never a stain The pavilion of Heaven is bare, And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams Build up the blue dome of air, I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, And out of the caverns of rain, Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb, I arise and unbuild it again. ;Well, I think Hollywood has been nurturing the concept for some years now that grotesque/ugly/monstrous will always turn out to be good; whereas beautiful/immaculate will inevitably turn out to be evil. See Heathers, Princess Bride, Edward Scissorhands, Young Frankenstein, Dallas/Dynasty ;p yadda yadda.. Anyway, what is so horrific about the nature of the beast?  - the creature had thin yellow skin, watery eyes, a shrivelled complexion and black lips. ummm... had Shelly never seen a really old person?  Is the horror merely that someone looking so (horror of horrors) old (!?!) could be so tall, strong and vital? Is this book merely about Shelley&apos;s fear of getting old, losing beauty (clear skin, clear eyes, plump complexion and full lips); or a fear of the old being dominant over a young bohemian free-love group of ex-pat hippies? Perhaps it is about the combination of old nature and young nurture which seems anathema to one with young nature and well worn nurture...? ;I just read and read and read until inspiration strikes me and I think &quot;I&apos;d like to write on that&quot;.  I did one theme, one structure, one character, and this time I&apos;ve attempted an interpretation of the author&apos;s prejudice. So I am experimenting too. I&apos;m also trying to see what appeals to markers - I&apos;ve tried smartarse, humour, shock and this time attempted empathy with a subset of markers. I don&apos;t think the number of markers really makes this viable but I&apos;m having fun although every time is a solid 4 so I&apos;m definitely feeling that I&apos;m being too conservative. I&apos;ve had no creative writing training since school (very little then) and I&apos;m not a fiction author so most of this is new to me. I did one arts module at University (on the psychology of horror) but my writing is all very technical these days so yes this is going crazy. The forums and feedback are great fun and I love the pickiness of the freewheeling to-and-fro argument in them - it is quite different to the pedantry I normally experience professionally. I&apos;m learning more on honing writing from the forum than the essays (I think). How do I do the essays?  I have my subject and I write (including rough quotes) until I have written 320+ words which gives me a frame. Then I go back and tighten up the language and exchange for synonyms where I think they are better. At that point I submit (just in case) and leave it for a while (a day) to marinade. Then I go back in and sort out the references and remove awkward structures and typos (easier to see after a break) and I read back around the area of the references and put more in, always keeping under 320. Then I leave it for a day and go back for tweaking and primping.  I always do 320 words and it is all done in the online box on my iPad with saves/submissions after every few changes (bad experiences with lost text). I have a very choppy workday so this fits in well. - this last one (Frank) I showed to a Mexican colleague because we are travelling together (raised eyebrows only and he is not a proficient native English writer so he couldn&apos;t really critique the grammar) but usually I don&apos;t get anyone to look. Lastly, my professional expertise is mainly verbal plus long emails so it doesn&apos;t really help here, Probably more likely hinders. I am really loving revisiting the essay several times as I don&apos;t usually get to hone a piece because of time constraints / immediacy and throughput of my job and I really really like going back in and changing words to fit a tone (e.g. labour instead of work for Frankenstein). Also trying to use evocative words to manipulate opinions instead of just being purely factual. :) Sorry for going on... ;So... Big long buildup, sudden climax, loss of interest.. Over and over again...  Shelley keeps repeating the same pattern of build-up followed by disappointment eh?? ;Intellectually speaking, 18 would have been a pretty peak time for most of the life of our species - after that age people are mainly gathering experience, not getting smarter (ask a mathematician).  While this text may be mature for an average 18 year old today, she wasn&apos;t average and neither are lots of modern people - statistically our population has a very long tail on individual achievement. I do agree though that our current western society tends to infantilise its population and doesn&apos;t really expect young adults to be as self-sufficient now as they were only a century or two ago. ;Yes, even the child who is supposed to be &apos;unprejudiced&apos; and too young to have &apos;horror of deformity&apos; sees him as an ogre. It is interesting that as readers we are guided towards judging the monster largely in a sympathetic way. We cannot actually see him, so we have no reflex animal response - perhaps we are a little like the blind man (although we have more knowledge). If we had been given a grotesque description of the monster looming over us as our first introduction to it, would we have been able to judge it quite so positively?  In some ways, it is understandable that we are reflexively concerned by the large. The potential for injury is greater. Even without training, a tiger is more scary than a cat; an Alsatian is more frightening than a Chihuahua. If you met a Neanderthal (or just a large man) in a lonely spot, you might well be more concerned than meeting a hobbit (Floresiensis), or a small woman, or a child (unless you have seen &apos;don&apos;t look now&apos; :).  We are also natively programmed by our human nature to be scared of the &apos;other&apos; - mainly because deformity in nature is frequently associated with contagious disease. It is only by nurture (society or experience) that we learn to overcome our nature. Perhaps Shelley wants us to realise that WE are the real monsters that have these natural prejudices and that they can only be overcome by nurture? That said, he sees the sleeping woman and just assumes that she will reject him - so he launches a preemptive strike and kills her.... ;Oh I don&apos;t know.. If I was going to learn dissection, I&apos;d rather start on a dogfish than a minnow;  a locust rather than a fruitfly; a cow heart rather than a shrew&apos;s..  It&apos;s not uncommon to start with a model that is easy, then move to the real thing... Sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller (dissection of a whale might be problematic). If he had started by making intelligent animals into humans then perhaps everything would have turned out OK... Hmmm... Maybe that thought should be held a couple of weeks :) ;I think that probably needs to be split further into non-human vs artificial. Non human: We probably wiped out the Neanderthals and other hominids (and absorbed them by cross-mating to a small extent); and as a species we are no strangers to attempted genocide - but - non-human doesn&apos;t necessarily mean that we will attack. On the contrary, we have absorbed cats and dogs into our homes and societies - they are not human and (mostly) are not slaves or tools. You can make a moderate argument for cats killing vermin and dogs guarding - but that&apos;s not a good enough argument for the degree that they are integrated into our lives and the costs of keeping them. They are not monsters but are very &apos;other&apos;. Something that looks human but is not, is often considered creepier (Robots that are too human often evoke negative impressions). As for human but artificial ... Well... Glasses, prosthetic teeth, pacemakers, artificial limbs, hearing aids, braces, piercings (ear or other).. All visible and artificial but not monstrous... IVF, inoculations, caesarian section, blood transfusions - invisibly artificial but do they make us into monsters.. ? Some religions would have us believe so. A cloned/designed human - monstrous? Soulless? I would argue no more so than someone conceived through IVF (or any other way). The monster was constructed from human and animal parts (reference to abattoirs) - so he is not fully human - but then surely if someone nowadays has a dental implant with bovine collagen then neither are they fully human ? :) On the other hand, if you met someone who was 8ft tall...... and fully human...... ;It&apos;s a little further down the syllabus page: In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne&apos;s &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment,&quot; and &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;; Poe&apos;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Oval Portrait,&quot; &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee.&quot;  ;Slightly irreverent here - but I was watching the post submission videos on the course again in anticipation of the next one and I got a really strong mental image of a Seldon vault - pre-recorded Seldon crisis :) Anyone else had this link to Asimov&apos;s Foundation ? - Please put your hand up if you are a mule or a second foundationer..... ;A couple of times now I have thought.. DID we discuss that on the forums?? Oh no the Seldon plan has gone awry.. Call in the psychohistorians... ;That&apos;s a really interesting area to consider (with a whole pillar of salt). Scientifically speaking, no, he didn&apos;t have the right. His behaviour was immoral and if the monster had a functioning human brain then it would have been illegal in most countries without due process. He would not have been allowed to make that decision on his own. Even if you consider the monster to be artificially reanimated without consciousness (plainly not true) disposal of human remains without informed consent is also a very tricky area. If he was mainly animal (abattoir parts were used) then as a vertebrate there are very specific procedures that are required in most countries, especially most of the ones in which this book is set. From a purely religious point of view e.g. Christian and I would suspect all of the other related monotheistic religions, the monster can&apos;t have a soul, is almost certainly blasphemous and I would suspect it might get shorter shrift than it would from science. :) From a Buddhist point of view - definitely immoral. Depends which century you are in for some of these answers I would think. ;Science is not silent on morality. Ethics are a very important area of science especially in the biosciences. Consider the Asilomar convention in the 70s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA Scientists have a long history of self-regulation to very stringent levels and involvement in regulation of the uses of their research (Take a look at Einstein&apos;s stance on Atomic weapons). You might even trace ethical science all the way back to Hippocrates :). The aristocrat mad scientist working alone like Victor is a useful plot device but doesn&apos;t reflect the way science actually works. Scientists completely depend on peer involvement and consensual interchange of ideas (&apos;shoulders of giants&apos;). I would argue far more than in the humanities where an individual can feasibly work alone and publish single author papers alone; science hasn&apos;t worked that way since the industrial revolution. The reason &apos;why&apos;.. was expressed in the rest of the paragraph - ethical conduct with regard to human tissues. Maths says nothing about morality, science on the other hand is not done in a vacuum (except on Hubble). ;</string>
            <string>You&apos;re right, thanks!:);@Jasper - Yes yes yes!!  Sounds like you might be interested in reading The Wisdom of Crowds - James Surowiecki. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds There are lots of examples (including the one you give) and the one that astounded me the m;Median should remove the &apos;mad, bad and dangerous to know&apos; reviewers. We use the median (actually &apos;median polish&apos; which is a little better but would be silly here) at work and it is a very effective way of removing outliers - surprisingly so. It works well in circumstances where most contributions are accurate reports but you get occasional / rare anomalies (reviewers with a &apos;bad hair&apos; day, or a slip of the brain). As for the % rules - if people felt free to give 1&apos;s and 3&apos;s more regularly, then I suspect there would be a lot more 1&apos;s and a lot more people would fail; but also improvements would be harder to see, because there would probably also be more 3&apos;s - and special should be rare - right? The marking would also generally be wilder with a lot more variance dependent on opinion more than objectivity (we have a marking model to fit) so it would have less meaning. The other book that complements this nicely is Outliers - by Malcolm Gladwell - a very good airport book :) Postscript: Your honeyed memes made me want to fly back and suggest &apos;The Extended Phenotype&apos; - Richard Dawkins to you if you want to know why bees do this kind of thing more than most social animals. ;I love the connection with Rapunzel (didn&apos;t see that one at all). I also enjoyed the connection to the Grimms via the &apos;make a mythology for a new country&apos; interpretation of incentive for writing. IMHO - Blooming possibly represents potential, specifically virginal (explicit comparison with D) and pre-fertilisation in actuality and in his dreams (&apos;Fertile of mysteries&apos;). The Vertumnus statue reminded me of Ozymandius and I linked it with the broken fountain and references to Eden implying ancient power now lost and forgotten with lurking potential ready to be awoken by incursion/invasion. Possibly given the forbidden, pernicious aroma of D&apos;s &apos;lady garden&apos; this dark potential is all wrapped up in the original sin of &apos;secrets&apos; becoming &apos;known&apos;. Didn&apos;t catch the translation of his name either - that tickled me, especially as my own surname is a synonym for Hawthorn and young/innocent/virginal :) . ;Some of the reviewers in the Grimm unit were quite critical of number of stories used - I&apos;m guessing that a limited focus might be received poorly. ...thoughts? ;That sounds a little like a challenge to link Grimm/Alice/Dracula/Frank and HawPoe together :) - I&apos;ve never read Hawthorne before so I shall be looking..... ;Laurie, I&apos;ve always assumed that because it says x of 5 left, and the submission status changes; that 5 are mandatory and the references to 4 are relics from the distant past (last run of the course). I&apos;m sure someone has said this before on the forum but I have a really bad connection where I am so It is painful to check.   I wouldn&apos;t risk it if I were you. If the corrections are many then give a few as examples, if it is conceptual then suggest an alternative approach or inconsistencies. Very few reviewers do a blow by blow of all issues. If it is mine then any feedback is welcomed as long as it is directed at my essay not my point of view ;p. ;@Laurie: The improbable happens all the time, it would be impossible for it not to - get the same reviewer 3 times though and that&apos;s a charm... If you had 5 reviewers you could get 22233 or 12233 and it would still be a median (ranked middle-point) 2; so ;Saw it, considered replying several times, but have nothing much to offer - I&apos;d probably do the comparison one given those alternatives - but for &apos;inter-author&apos; I would  possibly  have opted to do Heidegger/Valdemar and their relative approaches to the scientific method ;p .I&apos;m having the Dickens of a time sorting out an essay this week (luckily I&apos;m now in a fortunate time zone :). I was going to do obsessive compulsive repetition themes but I got sidetracked into obsessive research on one reading.There was only one that I had real troubles understanding; where I found weird jarring anomalies that didn&apos;t make any sense to me as a literal interpretation - so that&apos;s the one I&apos;m tackling (it has become a compulsion to &apos;get&apos; it - which seems appropriate). It does mean that this essay is probably becoming a dog&apos;s dinner as I slink away into either obscure historical/political allegory or  unifying secondary  imagery....  ;@Laurie, Florencia means the peer reviews of your essay, not the essays that you are peer reviewing. Sorry if I misinterpret a misinterpretation :) My dog&apos;s dinner got finished with 20 mins to spare - the most stressful so far !  It narrowly avoided being;Santa Anna was the main General - won the Alamo, got captured, exiled to Cuba, went back to Mexico by tricking the US and made himself president, tricking Mexico in turn. Was eventually defeated near Puebla. I have a Mexican colleague (we were actually in Puebla in May) who said today that Santa Anna wasn&apos;t well respected by his teachers (quote: because of his stupid tactics). ;Here is mine. I spent quite a bit of time rewriting it this week (stuck in an airport) and I was encouraged to be more provocative (@Mary, so I owe my breakout 5.5 to that advice :)  @Paulomi, I&apos;ve been footnoting like this all along (including within the forum) and no-one has negatively commented - it is a pretty standard approach where I normally write.  @peer4 - the greatest trick the devil pulled was hiding humour as unintentional... ;p --  At the core of Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein lurks a young lady&apos;s perspective of male attitudes towards pregnancy and procreation. Events shadowing the birth of the creature deliver a tongue-in-cheek criticism of male views regarding commitment, childcare and sexuality. Reproductive inequality across much of the animal kingdom often sees impregnation followed by abandonment of the female. This extends into human society which commonly permits superficial male involvement in child care (often immediately post-coitus). Young women in affairs with married men - like Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (not yet Shelley) - commonly perceive that a romantic or sexual liaison does not always result in long term commitment by the male partner once the &apos;goodies are delivered&apos;. This is a significant literary theme and Mary was very aware (and probably quite concerned with regard to her own circumstances) of the sexually promiscuous and non-committal nature of men. Women give birth, men do not. In a scientifically enhanced society men may ultimately procreate without female involvement. This book is a forecast of that unnatural possibility with extrapolation to dire consequences. In Frankenstein, Victor is obsessed with the pursuit of procreation [1]. He labours [2] through confinement [3] in an isolated masturbatory frenzy of research [4,5], culminating in a single moment of triumph; the ejaculation/birth of the monster [6]. The sudden climax of his desires brings Victor back to reality [7]. His urges are gone; he is immediately overcome with guilt and regret; and runs away to evade his responsibilities [8].  Themes of obsession building to climax crowned by disappointment and irresponsible abandonment pervade the entire book. As an unmarried (during Frankenstein early-drafts) &apos;free-love&apos; advocate with one tragic pregnancy, Mary might have projected her own conflicts onto Victor; or more reasonably she is suggesting that men are neither temperamentally nor naturally competent at bearing and raising children. A man, like a panda-bear, simply &apos;eats, shoots and leaves&apos;.  ===CITED=== Frankenstein - Mary Shelley. [1] &quot;I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life&quot; - p23.

You laid out your arguments very clearly and you have created a well-structured essay. Keep it up!  peer 4     Your essay is very well written and your argument quite coherent. ===CONTENT===(2.5) peer 1     Not only the grammatical aspect of your essay, but the content is very good. I really enjoyed reading it, and found you point on obsession, desire, climax, and disappointment worth thinking about.  peer 2     Your point of view sounds very interesting to me and it is persuasive too, I just think it is too restrictive to claim this as the core, I think would be better to say this is something like an important subject . But it is just my point of view  _ Thank you for enrich my reading.  peer 3     You did a wonderful job in sharing your ideas about the theme you have chosen. While I was reading your work, I really like that way you formed your fourth paragraph especially when you emphasized, &quot;Women give birth and men do not&quot;. I realized that, it was Victor who created the monster without the need for a woman, but it was Mary Shelley who wrote the story proving that the book was indeed a way of Shelley to express her thoughts the role of women in society.  peer 4     I think your thesis is interesting and well supported. Two passages were, I felt, unvoluntarily funny : &quot;child care immediately post-co  tus&quot; (nursing the embryo ?) and the comparison with pandas which are known for having a low level of sexual activity. ===OTHER=== peer 1     You are a good writer.  peer 3     Your way of writing is inspiring to me. I wish I could write that way you do.  peer 4     On the whole, a well-written interesting essay. ;Onanism was actually there originally but I took it out. Interesting term - it is one if those words that is attributed a meaning inaccurately - yes the word means what you think it does, but it is derived from Onan in the bible and he didn&apos;t actually do that - he was really a case of withdrawal not solitude, so it was good that I withdrew it from the essay. I also can&apos;t see the word without my left brain cracking Robert E. Howard jokes. I&apos;m finding Hawthorne generally a lot less inspiring than Poe (although.. Robotic butterflies, plastic surgery and transgenic vegetables... Hmmm... Starting to remind me of Jeff Noon). ;In that vein, Last Man - by Mary W. Shelley - has anyone tried it? Worth a look? ;To go back to the original sub-poster here. I have found Prof Rabkin a little variable at times and often amusing (I loved his Valdemar interpretation - it made me genuinely LOL with the sexual interpretation). The mattress/well/eden/oedipus thing has not convinced me yet... ...BUT !!!!... I have just finished watching: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/lecture/47 ...where he compares Portrait/Annabel and Cat/Bells ...and I was absolutely gobsmacked - the Usher/Raven was good too, but the Bells one just stunned me - I didn&apos;t see that at ALL and he presented it excellently with great timing. I need to go and get a latte, sit and re-read the Bells right now....! I feel like we are getting value for money ;p ;Those of you interested in the Faerie Queen might be interested in  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incomplete_Enchanter  by   Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. In this classic book, the modern protagonist is marooned first in Norse Myth and then in the Faerie Queen* itself.  @Patricia -  The protagonist  also uses syllogisms as a magical tool.. I know how much you love them :)By coincidence it is my current to-work-and-back audio-book (from audible in case anyone is interested).*anyone who likes this kind of thing - also see Inferno by Niven &amp; Pournelle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(novel)) re-interpreting Dante from a modern comedic perspective.  ;I see a lot of references to hands in that story:  The hand of Nature.  The hand of God (as Joanna points out).  The hand of man.  The hands of the spirit/fairy world. ..and of course the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force. Things in the story are written specifically by hand (and the implication of the hand of god having written moving on). Hands are also referenced in the text as they seize, gripe, offer, pass, grasp, point, touch, pluck, restrain, clasp, draw and variously leave marks on skin, paper, souls, mortality etc.. Suitors kiss hands and would like to kiss &apos;any&apos; of her hands. Hands (with opposable thumbs) are probably the most important feature that separates man from most beasts (Primates &amp; Koalas etc.. excepted :) - they are one of the most human of symbols and are probably a universal basic (cave paintings in Neolithic Gemany and Australian bush rocks show hands); hands are frequent human focal elements for sculpture and painting.  Hands are manipulative, hands are dexterous and sinister, hands are clean and unclean, protective and belligerent. ...and of course, you need hands to hold a little baby.... ....You need hands to show the world you&apos;re happy  And you need hands when you have to stop the bus  But the hands we love so dear  Are the hands we love to hear  Are the hands that You give to us...

Tales of incarceration...  ;@Jeanmarie - thank you very much, a very useful summary and it does help - you know. ;I read it that attainment and the generation of beauty was more important than permanency. It is like building a sand sculpture - you work for hours to produce something beautiful and at the end (sometimes during the creation process) people admire it. You know that the tide will destroy it; and if you leave it then a child (or even adult) will kick it down within minutes of you walking away. It doesn&apos;t matter though because you have done it and it is beautiful - and part of the beauty is in the very transience of the object. All things die but for a while they are lovely. Now for the tricky part that you may criticise - If a child, especially one that you love, gets enjoyment from smashing it, then surely that just adds to the experience - better the child than the sun or the tide.  In the story, Hawthorne hints that the child kills the object because he is a child of strength rather than beauty, also because he is like his grandad. Doesn&apos;t that just mean that they are incapable of producing beauty; and possibly, but not necessarily, malicious when they disregard beauty. It is in their nature which is just different from his - they believe they are right in what they do and we should feel sorry for them, not angry.  After all - Owen got his goal after many false starts...and all butterflies are transient. ;I didn&apos;t see the inlaid image on the box as about the child because he was startled to see him - I didn&apos;t think Owen knew about the child at all (all a bit too earthy for him). I saw the inlay as a reference to Owen&apos;s own transcendence of earthly physical bounds.  I did wonder why it was of ebony and pearl.  Ebony is a strong, dense, beautiful dark wood. In this case it acts as a practical base for the image and presents a strong contrast between dark and light. Pearl is very interesting here - something beautiful made by ugly biology: A water mollusc (oyster - reproduction symbol) takes a bit of irritating base grit and through long and laborious effort makes it into a beautiful and precious &apos;jewel&apos; - the pearl. It is probably not a coincidence that only a few oysters make pearls - most fail to transform grit into beauty. ;I&apos;ve managed to see the &apos;before you read&apos; video now and it is VERY clear that you could do one poem or story only - if that is the way you want to go... Hopefully all reviewers will watch the video :) ;Is this it? I looked it up based on your description - thanks Jennifer. http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/hawthorne-series-science-progress-and-human-nature ;I did wonder if this was an archaic use of &apos;eminent&apos; as a noun.  If I have the timings right then this is set at least 20-30 years before Frankenstein, before standard terms would have been commonly used for scientists (or scientist-like people). I may be wrong but eminent works for me as a noun for such a person.  I can&apos;t prove any of this but I&apos;m looking :) ;That one is OK I believe - try substituting &apos;width&apos; for &apos;absorbing energy&apos; - Still thinking about the &apos;eminent&apos; though... ;Yes, that makes sense - thanks John. It says something that my brain was much more willing to squeeze eminent into being a noun than it was to let proficient be one - it just seems unwieldy - perhaps that gut feeling is why proficient in that sense is not in common use any more - my brain-gut interface is usually pretty average / sensitive to the zeitgeist :) ;I think almost all of the layers are deliberate - you can see from Alice, Dracula, Frankenstein, Hawthorne etc. that the authors are blatantly trying very hard to put references to other literature in there (Shakespeare cheek to  jowl  with nursery rhymes). They are chock-full of allusions to gods, religious events, political issues, and so many other literary tools that these concept-&apos;philatelists&apos; will certainly be putting more subtle stuff in there as well. These &apos;deeper&apos; allusions will sometimes be obvious to us (because it still makes sense in a modern context) or cryptic (stuff so unusual or non-topical that we have to look hard and put it in context). So I think the &apos;hidden&apos; meanings are put there as deliberate &apos;easter-eggs&apos; for the target-reader to enjoy and the unsubtle (in their eyes) reader to miss :)These writers are all craftspeople - either because they are academic or because of their peers and  peculiar  personal circumstances (Stoker, Shelley) - so they almost certainly knew what they were doing with regard to symbolism; so I am convinced that they would not be putting a lot of unconscious symbology in there. The symbology is to my mind entirely cynical.  I was actually quite relieved to read that Poe  disliked  allegory - so his stories might conceivably be the richest hunting ground for unconscious / societal symbolism. He is also by far the easiest author to read from the selection to date because he is not trying to be clever in squeezing in as many external references as possible (I did wonder if his referential inclusions in the raven are actually a pastiche). I&apos;m loving that I can&apos;t find thinly disguised sexual references in his stories - it&apos;s quite a relief (fnarr fnarr).I propose that this is actually the main practical reason for the layers. Most of these authors would not have &apos;got away with&apos; the  explicitly  sexual, political or blasphemous  commentaries that all of these novels employ if it had been plainly  served.  The &apos;baked-in&apos; innuendo is their way to make an R-rated thought acceptable to those that could not see it without help. Like the thin disguises in popular music (e.g. &apos;relax&apos;) - it doesn&apos;t always take a lot to get past the &apos;censors&apos; if you are not blatant about it.Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but not when it is in a literary classic -   as Chekov says: &quot;If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it&apos;s not going to be fired, it shouldn&apos;t be hanging there.&quot;. I think this is true for allusion and symbolism too - we are simply finding these things too easily otherwise.;Ha ha - just watched https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/lecture/44 - score !! ;p ;I&apos;m sure that there are many opposing views and I would be interested in hearing those. Mainly because I am certainly not an expert and may be being overly pragmatic/cynical :) ...perfectly willing to hear that in the operating system of our brains there are many opportunities for trojans and ear-worms (!) - perhaps even independent of normal thought or function (..case of M. Valdemar anyone??). ;..and one immediately appears.  I just stood up and found &quot;coursera sera - whatever will be will be&quot; going through my head. Too much Poe!!!!! ;It is on the tip of my tongue, but I can&apos;t get the film &apos;Small Soldiers&apos; out of the way to say it...;SPOILER* Oooo Ooooo.... is it Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers by Harry Harrison ?? That is the one I was trying to remember... Loooong time since I read it - but it fits your description (Short book rather than short story though) and I remember it being hilarious (when I was 15). Now I have to stop avoiding this essay... ;Just a suggestion - 1984 is a good read but have you considered Brave New World - Huxley - less slow and in some ways a related classic. What is it about (which book) Wells that you prefer to Bradbury? (I agree with this BTW - I find Bradbury generally a bit &apos;fuzzy&apos; and &apos;pioneer-focus&apos; - except &apos;the fruit at the bottom of the bowl&apos; which feels like Poe :) - I&apos;m hoping to be re-educated wrt Bradbury here, ) I&apos;m sure you&apos;d get lots of book recommendations if you could pinpoint the element that you like. From the Wells &gt; Bradbury,  I&apos;m guessing you might like John Wyndham - perhaps try The Chrysalids? ;My mother was a fantasy fan and her books started me off. So to find the real origin (our ancestors before that were largely illiterate - we were household servants, navvies and AgLab), I asked her what converted her to Fantasy/SF.  Apparently it was Edgar Rice Burroughs - she started on Tarzan and then wanted more; so she tried A Princess of Mars -  the John Carter Books - and progressed from there through Wells, Wyndham etc..When I came along she already had a good collection and I read those (and nagged her to give me pocket money to collect the Dr Who books - an easy win, what parent would say no to &quot;can I buy books please?&quot; :).So I started with Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke (Rendezvous with Rama - particularly influential for me), Wells,  Wyndham.When I expanded from YA books, I collected Edmund Cooper, King, James Herbert, Philip Jose Farmer, Piers Anthony, Anne McCaffery, Niven &amp; Pournelle, John Norman (*cough*) ..and so started a lifelong obsession...No SciFi at school (we did Shakespeare, Hardy, Buchan, the Brontes) - but I did lend Niven &amp; Pournelle&apos;s Inferno to my English teacher, and she lent me Dante&apos;s original (which was much too hard for me at the time).I&apos;ve never actually read A princess of Mars so I am looking forward to coming full circle on that..!!!;Isn&apos;t that just so the origami unicorn can be left in the final scene to let him know that the cop had been there? Otherwise I saw it as the lowest step in a continuum of artifice of life forms - from origami to replicant. ;That&apos;s an interesting point. It might be partially solved by the thought that a review of a book should logically only contain external references to literature and the cultural background of the AUTHOR. In some ways that is a bit tricky, but all of the authors so far will have had access to the Bible and Shakespeare. Probably you can add Dante, Spencer, Cervantes, Chaucer to them (probably not to most of us though :). It might be harder to make a case for the religious books of other cultures (some more than others) and the same for the mythology. For example, I wouldn&apos;t expect most of the authors so far to be familiar with Australian or African origin myths. As we move to more recent authors and the pool of literature available to them, that will get trickier to judge. Sawyer/Huck, Kill/Mockingbird and Catcher/Rye might be fundamental to US writers but not the rest of the world. On the other hand - Quixote, Bond, Potter and Mulan might be pretty universally known :) All of the books on this course are from North Americans (mainly US) and North Europeans (mainly UK) and, small differences aside, the cultures are pretty similar, and have been dominated by Judeo-Christian imagery and media (at least for the period that these books cover) so common references of this kind are reasonably acceptable because the &apos;reasonably well-read author&apos; will know them and may have used them as inspiration. That said - how many people have read Leviticus (please do - its a blast) or Troilus and Cressida (ditto)? So obscure references are a bit tricky to judge... they shouldn&apos;t dominate and should be explained IMHO. ;Me too, I have a &apos;purloined letter&apos; So next week I&apos;m looking forward to a comparison of Jeff Wayne&apos;s War of the Worlds with Harry Harrison&apos;s Technicolor Time Machine. irony alert :) ;I&apos;m not sure there has been a film of TTM - definitely a radio play (which was very good).  My favourite bit was the paradox with the naming of the son of Erik the Red. If you are mixing it up with the Hot Tub Time Machine (saw it on a plane) - not the best film I&apos;ve seen... Neither was the remake of Time Machine with whatshername the singer. The original though with the shop dummy and the book choice question... Now you&apos;re talking... ...as for JW-WotW - dangerous ground.. I prefer all the voices in the original, but the remake did have some nice musical tweaks... Film-wise, the Pal original was frankly &apos;bobbins&apos;... Tom Cruise&apos;s remake was actually pretty good; and the &apos;it&apos;s not WotW honest&apos; Independence Day was quite amusing - until Goldblum had a good idea. I very much liked Orson Wells&apos; radio version too. Comparing the two... Hmmm...... ;I&apos;m not marking down for that although I would prefer that they cite the original references from those sources. I&apos;m quite flexible with the citations section since there are lots of different styles on here and as long as they are rational / consistent I&apos;m not worried. Formally speaking a Wikipedia or database reference should have a specific date/version/revision because they are transient ...but we don&apos;t have a lot of space and the date is obvious...! ;I found Hawthorne a bit flowery for me (especially Rappuchini :) - except the &apos;Artist&apos; and I didn&apos;t feel confident that I could match that one to any Poe (except by shoehorn into Valdemar). I really really wanted to do &apos;The Raven&apos; - but I was too intimidated. Hopefully we won&apos;t get &quot;you should have done both authors - 1&quot; comments tap-tap-tapping on our door. ;Ahh... No-one expects the Spanish Inquisition... ;I&apos;m not really convinced by this. How many of our ancestors wanted to die? It is not decency, what is decent about dying? If you took that argument to its extreme then genocide, murder or suicide would be the most decent human things to do - of course they are not. If someone eats healthily, exercises and thereby extends their lifespan, is that bad? If someone else chooses to smoke, sunbathe, overeat and eschews fitness, does that make them virtuous because they are shortening their time? I think this argument is confusing the extension of life with the mechanism. You are condemning &apos;artificial&apos; extension of life Because of science and the artificial scientific methods that predate formal science (e.g. agriculture, sanitation,  construction) most humans life much longer now than our hominid ancestors.  Without wheat, potatoes, rice, maize and other artificial crops, most of the humans that have lived so far would have died at a much earlier age (and most would never have existed). Without sanitation, inoculation, surgery, and &apos;minor&apos; artifices (glasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs etc.) many people would have a much poorer life and some would have died younger. So what is the line? If I can quickly turn part of your argument upside down: If tomorrow, a cure for all cancers through nanotechnology becomes available. Would you make it illegal because extending life is immoral? Some religions would say yes - I would personally view them as immoral. ;I agree completely - you can significantly extend your life by calorie restriction (it works on all kinds of species). ...but as the old joke goes: does it really extend your life or does it just feel like it... :) ;OK  6= 4+ (sqrt ((4x4)/4)) ;</string>
            <string>A poem that similarly stunned me when I was a teen is &apos;Anyone lived in a pretty how town&apos; by e.e.cummings. I&apos;ve just re-visited it and it still works for me - if you liked the music of &apos;the bells&apos; then you might like to try it too: http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 ;If you like well-read poetry with great imagery - I have to say that my very favourite is Dylan Thomas - Under Milkwood, read by Richard Burton. http://youtu.be/uuPO2Kvqlms .  ;Halo or horns, either could happen - and either would skew the marking.. Back-scratching is as bad as back-biting :);Reading the beginning of the link that seems like an excellent book for my reading list - thank you, much appreciated - I love a good dystopia :) In return, it also reminded me of &apos;this perfect day&apos; - Ira Levin. Quite thought provoking. ;Yes, and Stepford Wives  - I also enjoyed his &apos;a kiss before dying&apos; - quite Poe like... ;The thing that &apos;baked my noodle&apos; in Brave New World when I read it was the realisation that for 99.999%+ of the people in that world it was a utopia. For one person it was a dystopia.  Because of the point of view of the reader/author, you see it from the main character / your own perspective in a current society; and label it a dystopia. The reader then sympathises with the character(s) that consider their own selfish desires to be more important than everyone else&apos;s. One character in conflict with a whole society. Then the book switches to bring in another society and the reader&apos;s sympathy swings as the utopia becomes a dystopia for more characters - but ONLY when the two worlds interact. I won&apos;t give away the ending but the final resolution has always appealed to me (and was brought to mind when I saw the hippie colonies in Chiapas :) Nice to know that in the Arts community they are frequently served together (Scotch egg and baked Alaska ? Or is that too obscure an analogy - heh heh ) ;...great read (not on the syllabus BTW).  If you are going outside the recommended reading than the Time Machine is my favourite and I&apos;m always amazed how different these two are in style.

Kudos... ;Hi Georgy, The same is true in English. A master is someone who is good at something - I.e. someone who has mastered the craft. Master craftsman.  Master of Science/Arts/Philosophy (MSc, MA, MPhil).  Master piece - something made to attain mastery of a craft (can I recommend the beginning of the brilliant Titus Groan - Mervin Peake for a good introduction to this use) The use of master as a boss is presumably just an extension of this - control over people - sorry my ontological training is in another area :) - as in &apos;master of the house&apos;. A young child is also often called a master (and in formal/archaic letters sometimes has the suffix esquire [esq]- which means small knight) - not sure where this comes from (mastery of walking or language perhaps because toddlers don&apos;t have it). I believe master is always secular (non-religious) - but would love to have exceptions quoted back at me ! The formal distaff of master is mistress, but that&apos;s not always as popular nowadays :) ;Yes a ship&apos;s master is its captain - they are interchangeable in English. ;It seems to give a little leeway - I noticed this a couple of weeks ago when i was poking around for the essays to mark and added a fullstop in my essay to see what it would say and it allowed it -   about 10 mins after the deadline.;I agree with the others that there was too much biography (I fell into the same trap - same reason, so I understand the temptation). I liked the whole personification of a meaningless Death - that made me think with new insight (I actually went off down the road of the Final Destination films and wondered if a capricious and/or malicious Death works too). I would have liked more of this instead of the bio - especially expanding on the &apos;prize&apos;.  @Poulomi - Death is most certainly a her - Please see Neil Gaiman&apos;s Sandman comics :) ; and the bit in Pratchett when Susan takes over (hang on - Susan and her dimension hopping Grandfather - Death is really - William Hartnell - Nooooo!);Sorry Paloumi - The&apos;death is a her&apos; was supposed to be lighthearted   - Sandman is a high-art graphic novel where the personifications of Death, Delirium etc are quite quirky - Death is usually a goth-type (e.g.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_At_Death%27s_Door). I could have just as easily referenced Death as a &apos;he&apos;  in  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Pale_Horse  ; number one in a series of books about mythological personifications (by Piers Anthony) - He does Death, the Fates (Lachesis, Atropos and the other one :), time (Chronos) etc.. Actually   picked up a lot about myths from his books when I was younger.The William Hartnell reference was to the first  Dr Who. Death in the Pratchett books has a granddaughter called Susan, so did Dr Who at the beginning; and further similarities are clearly not a coincidence.Thanks for the info on  the Hindu pantheon.  My impression also  is that these gods are  not too clear about gender  in many cases. If I might venture a thought - in the case of SF in general  and the Poe / Hawthorne books in particular, wouldn&apos;t they be under the influence of Ganesh (science &amp;  knowledge) as muse?P.S.  I have a fair few statues of him/her (bought a new one last week in the Batu Caves - Biggest Vishnu statue there  I have ever seen!!!).   ;I liked the exploration of the possibility that the wife was a witch and the cat was her familiar - driving him mad by actions that neither we nor he are aware of in the text given. Being killed by an iron axe is a very witchy end ...and the fire.. hmm... I don&apos;t think I believe it but I&apos;m going back in to look - which is after all the point of these essays. Thank you.;Love it - just love it - yes the meter goes askew in the last two as you knew; and the content is contorted but it&apos;s brilliantly reported..   ..damn.. infected... Seriously, this made my day!;I quite liked the concept of &apos;hysterical fixation&apos; as a replacement for paraformaldehyde :)I think this is exactly what the hypnotism is supopsed to be doing here - suspending animation by psychic fixation - so I can go for that one.In the garden, most botanists would think of Nitrogen fixation before carbon fixation - did any of the plants have pods (most nitrogen fixing plants do)? The descriptions of the plants were mainly the inflorescences and runners/vines as I remember it - most carbon fixation is done in leaves and nitrogen in roots, it is the eyes that get fixed by flowers (that is why they are there - to fix the gaze of pollinators, mainly bees). - so I&apos;m not so convinced by this one.I think you could have used visual fixation as a broad thesis more successfully on all three and made it more about attention/distraction/mesmerising   - the chemical science stuff is cute but it is a bit tenuous really :)You missed out the Artist of the Beautiful - I would have thought your bioscience room-mate would immediately have thought of a way to fixate a butterfly that fits into the sublimation of desire that the Prof saw - as the Smiths put it in their &apos;poetry&apos; &quot;you can pin and mount me like a butterfly&quot; - more entomology than etymology there though..I enjoyed your essay, but i can see why others didn&apos;t.. it&apos;s a bit &apos;out there&apos; and I doubt Hawthorne would &apos;get&apos; any of the science / fixative references (except for my sticking butterflies to cork).;Just in case I was too obscure - the reference about the &apos;pin and mount me like a butterfly&apos; is from a notoriously miserable 80s group -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuWZEhbe8x8  . I was being a bit  facetious (with genuinely positive  intent though).Histological fixation is pretty old, certainly before 1900 - I need to look into that :);I can&apos;t see any spelling mistakes   - apart from the &apos;z&apos; in characterises (JOKE!). The grammar seems fine to me as well, sometimes a bit clumsy in terms of flow (especially the last sentence); but I&apos;m no expert on grammar.I like the concept and was tempted to tackle this theme as well. I didn&apos;t see Owen as an artist so I wouldn&apos;t have contrasted them so strongly - he is such a good scientist that it looks like art. To modify Clarke&apos;s third law: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (art).&quot;.;After seeing the amazing things posted here I feel very pedestrian and dull (confirmed by peer 1 :) -   but here it is:- I was making a foray into external factors affecting the poem; but I think I should have stuck with the internal stuff like I usually do - because the external stuff   seemed to be the main bugbear for the peers (I think).==SCORE 5==Annabel Lee is commonly claimed as Poe&apos;s devotional epitaph to  his wife,  Virginia Clemm Poe  who died in 1847; two years before the poem was completed.    Virginia was married as a child of 13 evoking the  early stanzas  [1]; and in 1955,  Nabokov promoted a paedophilic  reading as inspiration for &apos;Lolita&apos; [2]. Perhaps  not  the degenerate focus that Poe intended.This was Poe&apos;s last poem. His ex-employer (Thompson) exchanged it for expenses ($5) on the very trip where Poe mysteriously died [3]. This devalues the poem and belies its devotional interpretation. Also, Poe was 27 when he married and certainly not a child [1], so an unadulterated autobiography is not convincing.  The &quot;once upon a time&apos; [4] beginning immediately warns us that this is fantasy; the &apos;kingdom by the sea&apos; suggests a suspension of time, place and credibility.  Even Annabel&apos;s own name &quot;Lee&quot; (the place that the wind hits last), questions the mechanism of her death.   The narrator progressively decends to increasingly degenerate  observations ending in his lying down with Annabel Lee in her  tomb  [5]. This is not the only lying in evidence - instead of an epitaph, our unreliable (insane) narrator relates an unhealthy  and apparently unwelcome [6]  obsession with a very young girl culminating in emotional necrophilia.   The first two stanzas viewed in this context are unsubstantiated wish fulfilment easily interpreted as &apos;stalking&apos;.The language overwhelmingly drowns us in an amoral and unknowable sea of alliterative sibilance and  sussuration  [7], wave-like rhythms, and  nautical allusions (e.g. &quot;bore&quot; - kinsmen as   impersonal tidal  wave [6]).   Imagery is predominantly cold (dark,  windy,night,  tombs); even references to brightness (stars,  moon) are heatless luminescences. The only contrasting  images (seraphic:  fire-angels, dragons, serpents) represent discarded morality, suppressed guilt, and rejection of divine retribution.  The poem is most certainly not a romantic documentation of mourning and devotion; but a dark tale of fantasy and obsession.==cited==[1] &quot;I was a child and  she was a child&quot;- Stanza 2.[2] Letter  (1947)  V.

Excellent work!peer 2      The grammatical structure of your essay is balanced and good. The language is also plain and easy to comprehend, and it is also good to note that I did not see any errors.peer 3      Writing is fine.peer 4      The sentences are grammatically correct and the words are properly used. The argument is laid out clearly.peer 5      What wonderful vocabulary. A pleasure==CONTENT==(2)peer 1      Your essay is very enlightening and informative. However, your thesis statement was unclear and made the information you presented appear more like lecture points, rather than an essay. Actually, the more I think about it, this essay almost exactly mimics lecture points. Are you a teacher/professor?peer 2      The content of the essay does not really give any insight, rather it kind of gives a review to the poem and its background and settings with some of the literary devices employed.peer 3      Interesting ideas. But the Nabokov reference is totally out of place and doesn&apos;t add to the piece at all. I do wish you had kept your comments to just the literature.peer 4      The essay shows an understanding of the work, the argument makes sense. Concrete details from the text are used to support the argument.peer 5      Very complete.==OTHER==peer 1      I gave you a 3 in form and a 2 in content. Your essay was an absolute pleasure to read.

Thank you;@Rosie - firstly, thank you very much for the review - much appreciated. You are my first revealed reviewer and it is nice to make contact (I&apos;ve never seen any of my reviews posted, so I can&apos;t &apos;fess-up to anyone :) I had lots of word number issues this we;Don&apos;t worry, I said it was pedestrian compared to the crop this time - the comment about lecturing just allowed me a smiley :) Thanks for your additional guidance - much appreciated - I do need to be more explicit/condensed I suspect. The overall score was 5, which I am obviously very happy about.. As for Dr Who, oh...yes...., I was a member of both the Dr Who International Fan Club (DWIFC) AND the Dr Who Appreciation Society (DWAS) when I was 10 - just before they amalgamated :) . Which is/was your Dr? ;Topic-shmopic - we&apos;re talking Who :). From the current run, Tennant was my boy, but my original Dr. was Pertwee (Spearhead from Space). Although I think Baker probably had most of the best rounded plots in TOS (especially look out for the whole season based on the ark in space). The Dr was often a little bit loose with companions in the original series (especially early on) and a fair amount of the time they were just colleagues or locals (like Leela, Benson, Jamie etc.). I think my favourite companion is still Sarah-Jane Smith. It was often very detective-like and &apos;did a Christie-plot-ski-ramp&apos; (last para has to get us back on topic right? :) where the answer to the detecting problem was fantastic (Peladon, Daemons, Robots of Death etc..).  ;...oh and Troughton once met Rapunzel (not Rabkin&apos;s Rapunzel though - my Dr was sexless - I think Megan agrees :). ;Rousseau clearly never saw a troop of Baboons, wild-dogs, chimps or any other social mammals :) More (less?) seriously, this isolation = degeneration would be a &apos;Lord of the Flies&apos; approach. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies Putting the two together you might be interested in Primal by Robin Baker http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Robin_Baker His sperm wars book was very good, his fiction much less so (but still in this vein). ;The story reminded me for a lot of obvious (and not so obvious reasons) of the classic SF novel Dark Universe by Galouye.  If you enjoyed the concepts in this story and would like a more detailed treatment from the perspective of the &apos;blind&apos; then I can highly recommend this book. I found it quite hard to get hold of but it is also on Audible with an introduction by Dawkins (!?!). As for the story - I&apos;m seeing religion everywhere. Noooooo - what has this course done to me....?!? ;Depends really - I do suspect that a hefty inclusion of external issues rather than literary ones might be reviewed less well; I&apos;m also guessing that a historical review of ability issues at the time might not go down brilliantly either.  BUT - if this one really tickles your fancy then you could always consider it a &apos;burner&apos; essay and take the risk - I&apos;m presuming you don&apos;t NEED the score and I&apos;m sure you could make it very readable.  On the other hand, you could write it literally instead of literarily for your own pleasure and post it here for comments and submit a second one if you had the inclination...??  Hmm.. Bet that doesn&apos;t really help much... ;To those on this thread - just to make a &apos;public service&apos; comment that this week we are doing:    Wells     The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, &quot;The Country of the Blind,&quot; &quot;The Star&quot; NOT War of the Worlds, Time Machine, Things to Come, etc (although I would have loved to).(This is not intended to be patronising and it is not a spoof - just helpful because I can empathise with your disappointment - really - if you are uncertain, please check the Syllabus page).;Hi there, I&apos;ve done a first pass with minimal suggested changes (although I rewrote the end because on a phone I couldn&apos;t edit sensibly :) Also, I wouldn&apos;t start a formal sentence with &apos;because&apos;, but I have kept as much of your text as I think possible. Please appreciate that some of this is opinion. My feeling is that you might most benefit from some exercises in tenses and plurals.  I would give this a low 2 but others might be more harsh.   Because this is a course about literature and [has] grammar and structure in [writing] as one of [the] grading point[s], beside[s] the evaluation and critique from peer evaluation, maybe it [would] be valuable if some student[s] in the course that [are both] [n]ative speaker[s] and fluent in English share some of their knowledge and experience in English to improve the [E]nglish of [those] student[s] that [do not] have [E]nglish [##] as their native/first [language] ( [such as] me).Hopefully we can improve our [writing] in [E]nglish together, especially for the next assignment.   ([B]ecause I always receive 1 point in grammar, please can you grade the writing above between 1 and 3 to show my errors :)    ;I&apos;d also split it up into shorter sentences! ... Also &apos;such as me&apos; is very very informal - but that part of the post is too. ;Well formally it would be &apos;such as I&apos; but that sounds very formal. I would be tempted to put the thought elsewhere in the text.  &apos;English is not my native language along with many others in this course..&apos;. ;I can&apos;t find the gesture you are describing in chapter 11. The gorilla counts off his 5 fingers and makes the link between them (he is also a 5-finger man) that is different from the animals &apos;raised&apos; from hoofed animals. A bit later, the gorilla is asked how long he has been there - he holds up 3 fingers (which isn&apos;t explained then). I can&apos;t find anything with 3 missing fingers - I was wondering which fingers it was because if the missing fingers are 2 middle and thumb, then that is the sign of the cuckold, or the evil eye; either might be interesting but I can&apos;t see the description :( ;Thanks Daniel. I think it is a kind of greeting in that the Gorilla lets Edward see how many fingers he has by counting them off slowly and querying that he do the same... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, eh? The gorilla is saying &apos;I have 5 fingers, how many do you have?&apos;.  Edward makes the right response (I&apos;m the same as you), but doesn&apos;t fully understand why until later when he sees those with fewer fingers. The gorilla then keeps on telling the other people that Edward is also a &apos;5-man&apos; like him, as it is important to him that Edward is similar (and possibly that some of the others are different because they come from sheep etc. with fewer fingers). I think it IS important that the gorilla makes this link so strongly. This is like some of the reasons discussed in the forum and essays about &apos;the birthmark&apos; (the hand is critical to humanity). Possibly (at a really really long shot) - something like in Animal Farm - Orwell (2-legs bad, 4-legs good --&gt; 4-legs good, 2 legs better) might be at work here.. Does finger number define a &apos;class&apos;?  I&apos;d like to see a surfing Gorilla though - great balance I&apos;d think.... ;Lots of animals actually make and use tools, from chimps to birds and through to octopi - so man &apos;was&apos; the tool using animal back before science observed that he wasn&apos;t unique in that respect (e.g back in Well&apos;s day). A modern writer of Well&apos;s equivalent scientific credibility probably wouldn&apos;t have made that mistake. Interestingly, people of his day would also have pointed out the opposable thumb as something very special and would possibly have predicted an animal with two opposable thumbs to become the evolutionary &apos;master-race&apos;, we now know that is not true (no worries there - you need 2 opposable thumbs AND a good diet :).The point about mimicking the physical aspect of the visible god is interesting but I think this equation of looks=divinity is largely peculiar to a small number of religious sects and their descendants (e.g. the Judao-Christian-Moslem tribe) - and those sects of course are doing exactly the opposite - imagining God in the image of themselves (or actually mainly their dad, sometimes their mum at a push). I actually think this may be one of the core jokes/digs in the book, Wells is knocking the whole concept of the anthropomorphic God of the monoatheists.Many polytheistic religions are much more up front about this issue - they have gods that specialise in tasks just like they do on Earth (Norse, Roman, Greek, Egyptian); not all of whom are a physiognomy fashion goal (e.g. Sutekh, Ganisha, Dionysus, Loki [really a giant]), Many religions do not have physical form fashion as a core tenet at all - e.g Buddism, wicca - and have enlightenment purely as a goal in itself, not attainment of a bodily standardisation.I can imagine a Wells/Lovecraftian Chthulu fusion where the number of fingers gets completely out of control...  ;Welll... we are singing from much the same song sheet.. but I would change:&quot;bleak, mechanistic universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for  any  god&quot;  to:&quot;wonderful, knowable and democratising mechanistic  universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for  any  god&quot;--As for the &quot;inferiority of other races was evidenced in their inferior tools&quot;, it is interesting to me that a lot of apocalyptic fiction since the 60s has side-swiped or centralised the issue that we (&apos;industrialised society&apos;) do not know how to make tools any more. Our society has become so internally co-dependent and in (most countries) reliant on mechanisation; that &apos;come the plague/nuclear/weather/oil/zombie apocalypse..&apos; we would be hard pushed to make even the most simple of weapons or staples - could YOU make a functional bow with your bare hands?  My first contact with this concept was in the brilliant Survivors - Terry Nation (great book, better sequel,  stunning but sadly dated original TV series,  so-so remake [No that is NOT Tom Price!!!]). Wherein they point out soap, batteries, hearing aids and then move on to everything else we cannot make individually..My ancestors made flint axes from local materials and at a push I could do it too. I know enough chemistry to make soap from first principles (using burnt seaweed and a slaughtered pig - didn&apos;t say it would be nice soap); I could possibly make copper and bronze but I probably couldn&apos;t find the ores (without a very good book); and I certainly couldn&apos;t make steel on my own. So as tool makers we are now pretty low on the pecking order as individuals. Any smart person knows that racism is stupid arrogant nonsense (unless perhaps we find a neanderthal?! or uplift a bonobo [or toaster] then bets might be off) - but the tool-use/make difference in Well&apos;s time accorded to race was really not down to hands, brains, colour or any other triviality - it was down entirely to one thing - reading and writing, especially across generations. (Wo)Man is the recording animal.    ;Unfortunately not so much under debate as you might think. Most wars and extensive disasters where society is not immediately reimposed lead to a very rapid breakdown in social mores where murder, rape, torture and other &apos;forbidden&apos; practices are very commonly observed. Consider Nanjing, Vietnam, Kosovo etc etc ad nauseum...Society likes to pretend these things do not happen (not by our country certainly) and history often covers up abuse to the level of denial (examples with-held). On a minor level we make these myths of selflessness and individual altruism and promote them as the norm (e.g. the myth of &apos;women and children first&apos;, &apos;the captain goes down with his ship&apos; - there are recent papers showing this doesn&apos;t happen and women and children do far worse in shipwrecks - the crew come off best in survival statistics (especially the captain).Sorry guys but civilisation and social control is the only thing keeping us from barbarism - possibly only by a few hours (for example if oil suddenly ran out - projections suggest about 48 hrs to collapse our current civilisation).On a lighter (!) note - Chrysalids is fantastic Javier, good call by Elizabeth - I&apos;d start there ..you might find Kraken Wakes a bit annoyingly British at the beginning - it is quite terribly tiffin and tea - also a very good book though - us Brits do excel at end-of-the-world stuff ;p.     ;Thanks Elizabeth, very thought provoking, hope you don&apos;t mind if I respond to defend my thesis :)I don&apos;t want to put the links here, but a quick google search on [riot rape] leads to a lot of recent examples all over the world; so I&apos;m not convinced it is a military issue (although, yes, mine were military but I was trying not to use anything too recent). The power-cuts/brownouts of the 70s oil crisis saw a big crime rise including violent crime in several countries.When society breaks down (and it is pretty close to the edge in locations in most countries a lot of the time, triggers are not difficult to find), most people hunker down and retreat from society but a few can cause significant damage.BTW - There are quite a few (ancient) societies that fell over from within (Mayans, Greenland Vikings, Early US settlers [Norse and other Europeans], Easter Island, Anasazi). I agree that in a failing society the military would fall early -   because they wouldn&apos;t get paid, would have lost their core function, and would need to look after their own. It might be interesting to see who died last in those societies.... and how... I&apos;m sure someone knows.Now for some tiffin....;Yes!! Read triffids again - there is a lot more to it as an adult - I try to read it every year (because I&apos;m a sad obsessive :).;Yes, I smiled about that too :) I found the physics quite hard to fault although I thought the timing was quite condensed and I&apos;m not sure that I was convinced by the momentum issues in Neptune vs the &apos;star&apos;.  Although - it must have been  going pretty fast hmmmmm... Quite a lot of coincidences but....  I&apos;ve settled on this one for my essay. ;The ending is refreshingly nihilistic :) - there is a lot about the ending of this story that reminds me of &apos;On the Beach&apos; - by Shute and &apos;Down to a Sunless Sea&apos; by Graham (the British miserable ending, not the sappy happy-ending US re-write).  @Greg - I disagree - I think the naming has to be very precise; but I&apos;ll have to wait for the essay to explain because I&apos;m still trying to work out how to say it in less than 1000 words :);</string>

            <string>I love King myself, I haven&apos;t gotten around to the Dark Tower series yet but I love his one book, The Eye of the Dragon. Of course, I also adore his other classics, especially Pet Semetary.  ;I love the Song of Ice and Fire series! I feel like I should re-read them because there is so much going on, but the list of books I want to read is already long enough. It&apos;s a conundrum most readers are faced with.Since I purchased a Kindle I&apos;ve gone crazy downloading books. At first I was against the idea of an e-reader, but I&apos;m travelling right now and carting around twenty pounds of books didn&apos;t sound like the best of ideas. Amazon has tons of free stuff, I even have a couple textbooks downloaded for GRE test preparation. At the moment I&apos;m switching between  Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence, Symbolic Logic by Lewis Carroll, and The Grammar of English Grammars by Goold Brown.;Thanks for sharing, definitely sounds like an interesting read. Congrats on getting published!;They&apos;re definitely watching. Educated people are more difficult to control (particularly the people who find intrinsic worth in education). We might be safe in a literature class, but look out if you sign up for At Home Bombs 101 :P;Great analysis! Working in a similar vein I see a lot of the tales as a reflection of the inner workings of the individual. Like Abigail mentioned, most of the characters are fairly one dimensional and are only shown as being all bad or all good. In reality, people are multifaceted (good people sometimes do bad things and vice versa) and our concepts of good and bad are much more complex.In The Cat and Mouse Partnership the mouse is the industrious and prudent nature of the individual. She is the voice in everyone&apos;s head saying, &quot;We ought to save this for later.&quot; The cat, on the other hand, is the irresponsible side of the individual; he takes the path of least resistance, lying when it suits him and interested only in instant gratification. At the end of the story when the cat devours the mouse it&apos;s as if the immoral, hedonistic side has taken over. Both aspects are manifested in many people&apos;s personalities and it is important to keep a healthy balance between the two. Too much indulgence can create an unproductive villain while too much focus on duties and responsibilities can make a person provincial and limited in outlook.;I take a less symbolic view and think the inclusion of royalty adds to the entertainment value. I think a lot of it has to do with using stories as a form of escapism, royalty is like their version of celebrity. It&apos;s typical of television today: People are obsessed with the rich and famous. Popular television constantly focuses on beautiful characters who live in nice houses (Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City, The Real Housewives of where ever) because people like to be taken away from their ordinary lives. Same as with Grimm&apos;s fairytales, we also enjoy seeing our celebrities self destruct and act immorally.;I don&apos;t think so. I know there was lots of speculation, but people often seek to demonize those who transcend our ideas of normal. Carroll was a strange guy. In one realm he was a bookish mathematician with a stutter and in another an author of delightfully silly fiction. He was close friends with a lot of children well into their adulthoods (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll/Child_friends_and_adult_friends);  some have even refuted the idea Carroll was ever inappropriate in his affections.;I think you&apos;re on to something here. Throughout the story Alice goes through many physical changes, even questions if she is still the same person she was when she began her journey. The them of the self being preserved through time is touched upon in many different ways. Time is a really slippery topic; we all have an understanding of time, but when questioned directly about what time really is (a thing, a property, a tool, a human invention?) many people are at a loss for words.&quot;What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.&quot; --St. Augustine;I found this first essay pretty tough too! At first it seemed like each topic I chose was too broad or too obvious and I couldn&apos;t delve into it properly with the 320 word restraint. After re-writing the entire thing for the fourth time I decided even though it&apos;s not profound it&apos;s good enough and I hit submit. This first essay felt like a practice run to me; I think after we get them evaluated the next essays will be easier since we&apos;ll have a sense of what&apos;s expected.;</string>
            <string>I think grading works like this:If you receive an average score of at least 1.8, you will pass the class. Only your seven highest scores (out of the ten assignments) are considered for this average.In his example he states that one could receive scores of 2 points on six of the considered essays and 1 point on the last and still earn a passing average of 1.85. I&apos;m not sure about your math here: a score of 3 on all seven of the scored essays would give you an average of 3, not 1.5.;I think it&apos;s funny you refer to a lack of logic in Alice because I see it as a very logical work (just goes to show how different perspectives can be).I especially love the line Tweedledee says: &quot;If it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn&apos;t, it ain&apos;t. That&apos;s logic.&quot; It&apos;s a fun little tautology masquerading as a tongue twister.;</string>
            <string>well, lemony snicket, and johnathan swift, and i love harry potter and well, i couldnt really finish the god of small things, not really my cup of tea. im more of the tom holt, roald dahl kind of person. i would highly recommend the shadow lines by amitav ghosh, it is by far one of the best novels i have   read. and then of course there is paollini, and then there is tolkein and cs lewis, i for one actually really enjoy jane austen and shakespeare and stuff like chaucer and euripedes. just the fact that these were written in a time and space so removed from mine excites me. i havnt really touched south american or african literature, just the occasional gordimer, but will do that soon.;</string>

            <string>Hello Jim,The issue of morality in this series is one I find to be most compelling, the murky grey world Martin portrays is an amazing comparison to our modern global social climate.   Martin first of all presents morality as a subjective idea rather than a strict unwavering code.   His characters move through the world and as they do you see there core values and ideals change.   He also implies that a persons base sense of morality is shaped by many different outside forces such as religion, politics (or house loyalties), ethnicity, and culture.   These same views have never been more substantial than in todays modern world with our ideals of multi-culturalism and global citizenry.   It seems as our wold gets smaller Martin&apos;s world, and the realm of epic fantasy itself, is expanding and may eventually become as large a reality itself.;Hello Carol,I have read the entire series to date and I have to say Martin&apos;s style of narrative is one of the greatest of it&apos;s merits.   The focus on the individual players allows for the reader to not only learn to view Martin&apos;s world from the perspective of it&apos;s inhabitants, but also to understand the deeper motivations of the players actions.   This combination adds a drama element not traditionally present in fantasy that causes the reader to become more intensely immersed in the story.   I would even go as far as to say that Martin provides a new take on escapism.   ;James I have a theory about the shadowy magic system, which I will not go into detail on because you are not currently up to date with the series and I don&apos;t want to ruin it for anyone, that follows the line of thought that the essence of the supernatural elements in this series relates to the final outcome in such a way that to reveal the nature of how and why they occur before certain key events in the story would allow the reader too much insight into the conclusion.   However I would encourage you to read all of the volumes more than once because on my second read through I discovered that several small events, that seemed to be filler at first read, turned out to foreshadow major events (for example an understanding of the Frey&apos;s &apos;king of the crossing game&apos; can mayhaps give insight into predicting their actions and motivations).;I had to check my free kindle store version against the text linked on the course page the translations are very different and some of the titles didn&apos;t match at all.   In one story (The Wolf and the Seven Goslings) my version had the main characters as goats instead of geese and I almost missed the connection.   So my advice is to check the text against the first paragraph of each story. Mine were in a relativity similar order, there is a good chance you have them all in your translation so I would check again.;</string>
            <string>I love Shakespeare, however Macbeth and Hamlet are my tied for my favorite. I enjoy reading Plato as well though I haven&apos;t had the time for reading, sadly. Euripedes I remember having to read in my philosophy class. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is wonderful, I love his works as well.Although I enjoy the Illiad, I prefer the Odyssey. I remember reading and hearing about it as a child and I immediately fell in love with it.  ;Yeah, actually Philip K. Dick is one of the authors who have more of their work adapted to movies. Next, Total Recall, Paycheck, Minority Report and The Adjustment Bureau all come from his stories :D;Oooh, how could I forget The Black Cauldron! I love that movie, and I also thought Titan A.E. was not that bad, though for some reason, I have a bunch of friends who think it&apos;s one of the worst movies ever made.;I would have to say that Tyrion is my favorite character, however in waiting for winds of winter I find that I am most excited to continue with the story of Jon Snow who I think will turn out to be a lot more than he seems to be, but I wont go into that now as many have not read through the series up to date;The assignment submission link won&apos;t be up until after the firs unit 1 video is released which I believe is in about an hour and the deadline isn&apos;t until noon tuesday (EST)here is the link to the course calendar in case you had trouble finding it.https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseCalendar;For my essay I choose one of the many overarching themes that run across many of the tales and then used a specific tale as a working example.   I hope that helps you, but as this is the fist assignment I can not completely say that this method is correct.;John,I would encourage you to start a new thread on this subject and just mark out your spoilers so others know not to read it until they finish the reading.  On another note, if there is one thing I have learned about history in my research, it is that the history we are presented with on paper rarely, if ever, syncs up with the experience of people who lived it.   ;</string>

            <string>I think that the criticism no matter how unjust we may feel it is can only motivate us improve as writers.   That being said I have just today received an assignment to peer review that was all one block of text and completely unintelligible. So what am I to do? Should I up-rate   the essay to spare someones feelings or should I give the marks that are clearly deserved? Where does one draw the line?;Patricia,When I said unintelligible I meant it in the most literal sense, there was almost no punctuation, and almost every word was spelled wrong. I could not even figure out which story they where writing about much less the point they were trying to make;</string>
            <string>Heinlein strove to be controversial in his every thought and it was that characteristic that allowed him to take the title for most Hugo Awards (4), which he still holds to this day. Those novels, if your interested, are as follows:&apos;Double Star&apos;&apos;Starship Troopers&apos;&apos;Stranger in a Strange Land&apos;and lastly&apos;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&apos; (Which is the only novel ever to be nominated twice for a Hugo)Quite an achievement IMHO.;In writing fiction if anything is taboo then everything is taboo.   How can art mirror life if it is censored when life is not?;The Librivox readers always put me to sleep. It seems like they get the most boring sounding people on purpose.;&apos;1984&apos; and &apos;Brave New World&apos; are studied together probably more than any other two books in the genre as they essentially present two sides of the same coin and have elements that closely represent modern society. In the Information Age &apos;1984&apos; is relevant to the social climate in parts of Asia and the Middle East, as in these areas heavy censorship and tight control of media are prevalent. Conversely Huxley&apos;s &apos;Brave New World&apos; is representative of the social climates of Western Europe and North America where we are flooded with so much information through free media that creates essentially the same effect as the aforementioned censorship. In any case these two novels represent the archetypal basis of dystopian science fiction and are definitely worth a read.;The books that got me started on Science fiction were &quot;Starship Troopers&apos;, &apos;A Princess of Mars&apos;, &apos;Ringworld&apos;, and &apos;Brave New World&apos; all of which came in a box of paperbacks I got for 50cent at a yard sale when I was in 4th grade. This box also included the first six books in Moorcock&apos;s Elric saga, several Tarzan and Conan novels, as well as, my all time favorite spy novel,  John le Carre&apos;s &apos;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&apos;.;Ever time I think about &apos;The Time Machine&apos; I get David Bowie&apos;s song &apos;Changes&apos; stuck in my head.;the Deaths Gate Cycle was awsome;&apos;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&apos; is an amazing novel and I believe the proof of this symbolism lies in the title itself.

Dick&apos;s work translates to the big screen better than any other author in the genre.;Very true but I would go even further and say that all of his work explores the depth of human perception. In the works you mention the memories themselves are not as important as the clarity they lend to the overall land scape of the story.  In &apos;A Scanner Darkly&apos; the main actors are hidden from perception by technology that conceals them by overloading the senses with too much information, distracting from the truth of what is hidden beneath, and thereby mirroring the perception of the protagonist.   In &apos;Minority Report&apos; we are introduced to a world that is presented as entirely deterministic however, later we discover this may not be the fact. In &apos;Total Recall&apos; we don&apos;t know what memories we can trust.   In all cases it&apos;s not what we see that makes the story, it&apos;s what we don&apos;t see.   In the same way It&apos;s not what the author says in his novels the we need to pay close attention to, it&apos;s what he doesn&apos;t say. Do androids dream of electric sheep? Do dreams indicate the presence of a soul? It&apos;s never clearly stated but it&apos;s implied, and its that implication that shapes our perception and allows us to accept the possibility of the impossible.;I think it sometimes you just don&apos;t hit the nail. Personally I don&apos;t expect to see a good mark when the results come in because after watching the videos on the unit I realize that I missed a major point in my reading which in turn made all the conclusions in my essay wrong. Luckily this is the first time this has happened and the balance of my work should even it out. And on another note I&apos;m curious if everyone watches the unit videos before grading the essays. I always do and I feel it helps my perspective when reviewing the work of others.;I think your assessor did not pay much attention to the novel as the monster quite clearly makes the same connections in his reference to &apos;Paradise Lost&apos;. I some times wonder if some people are actually reading the material. I have myself received feedback that would indicate the assessor had little or no knowledge of the course material.;</string>
            <string>My favorite author of all time is Roddy Doyle.Others in no particular order, across a variety of genres:Neil GaimanTerry PratchettNaomi NovikFrank McCourtMalachy McCourtKurt VonnegutBob FlanaganRay BradburyAlfred SloteJ K RowlingStephen KingTim Pat CooganMorgan LlywelynBarbara KingsolverLeon UrisF. Scott FitzgeraldJohn Brendan KeaneAmy TanBrendan BehanColm T _ib _nLalita TademyAnd the two screenwriters whose work I can identify from half a line of dialogue I&apos;ve never heard before:Aaron Sorkinand Russell T DaviesSince I was buying a few books for this class anyway, I threw in a copy of Russell&apos;s &quot;The Writer&apos;s Tale,&quot; which I haven&apos;t read yet... but I love when writers write about their process. It&apos;s never the same as mine, but there&apos;s always something familiar and warm about it.;Candice, this is the link from which I read the book. It is free and as far as I can tell legal (and I suggest you check out the rest of the site, I discovered it while searching online versions of this book and I really loved it!).http://www.archive.org/stream/householdstories00grimrich#page/n11/mode/2up ;Did anyone load this book onto a kindle?   I clicked through the links given in the course syllabus, but even when I pulled the course up on the kindle, the book would not download.   ;</string>
            <string>I found many of the princesses, though described as very beautiful, to be, if not evil, completely lacking in good character. Specifically the princess in The Frog Prince and The Three Spinners. It&apos;s seems that the fact that they were beautiful covered all flaws, which I also found hard to swallow.;I read very slowly and don&apos;t think I will be able to finish all the reading. However, the way the class is set up, it doesn&apos;t seem necessary to finish the reading completely. I will write my essay on my insights into whatever I am able to read. I don&apos;t feel that 320 words is enough to cover a whole book anyway.;</string>
            <string>While I don&apos;t deny that referring to a back story may be a valid technique for analysis, I was disappointed that the professor took the same sexual take on all of the tales he covered. Were they valid? Probably, But there are so many other ways to look at these stories. I hope that he doesn&apos;t continue with the Freudian view through the Lewis Caroll selections.;I also found the word limit frustrating. In reading another thread, someone mentioned that there is a 30-50 word buffer before the submit button goes away, so I may take advantage of that next time.;I thought your essay was very enlightening. I got a bit confused on the last paragraph simply because I had forgotten the part of the story concerning Faithful Henry. It was a very good use of outside literary works to give context to the tale.;That was interesting to say the least. Not really in line with the assignment, but an interesting commentary on society.;I was very disappointed to only receive three reviews. I did my five and made the time to do some extra as well, because I think I will get more out of this course from the peer reviews than from the opinion of the professor. While I did benefit just from being able to review other students submissions, I would like to have heard a bit more about how I could improve. I&apos;m also a bit concerned about how this could affect grading. I got a 4 but, if one out of three people were to have given me a 1 would it not effect the overall score significantly more than if one out of five were to give the essay a 1?  For those who are worried about time, I would suggest that we ignore the 30 word minimum. Most people seem to have done so anyway. ;To my understanding, the point of the assignment was to convey &quot;the point&quot; to the reader. Not that they have to agree, but if your reviewers did not &quot;get the point&quot; then you did not support you thesis in a meaningful way. I find that, having five reviewers, it is unlikely to get more than one that might be truly unfair. The grading system is set up so that a single critical grade won&apos;t bring you down. If a number of reviewers gave you a &apos;1&apos; then you may have some work to do. I would very much like to read your essay in the other thread.;We were specifically told not to give &apos;3&apos;s more than, I believe, 10% of the time. I am a person who likes to give high grades so this is hard for me, however, I understand the reasoning. I gave three out of the eight essays I reviewed a &apos;3&apos; for content and only one a &apos;3&apos; for grammar. I also only gave one &apos;1&apos; for both content and grammar but that was because there were so many spelling mistakes that I couldn&apos;t figure out what they were trying to say. I think most students err on the side of generosity.;This is, by far, the best thread I have read. Thank you for remembering that, in the end, this class is just for fun and learning. No need to get our panties in a twist about grades that no one else will see and we are not paying hundreds of dollars for. ;I find it interesting that these days vampires and dragons and other mythical creatures are the heroes of our movies and books whereas, in previous ages, anything unnatural was seen as villanous and evil. What do you think has changed?;You may be looking for a bit much if you are holding everyone to &quot;advanced&quot; undergraduate grading. Most of us are here to learn for fun. Many of us have never taken college level English and quite a few don&apos;t speak English as a first language. Offer constructive comments but keep this in mind when &quot;grading&quot;. ;I wholeheartedly agree! The essays I got referencing Freud seemed to just throw out ideas trying to latch on to something the professor would have discussed in the last set of videos. ;I was very excited to get one essay (out of seven so far) that actually had a clearly written thesis. Most of mine seemed to think they needed to address the professors question as to whether the book was for children or adults but didn&apos;t feel the need to actually tie that into there essay in any way. I have been far less impressed with the insights coming out of this book than the Grimms&apos; tales.;</string>
            <string>My favorite books as of now are:&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; by Chinua Achebe&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper  Lee&quot;Animal Farm&quot; by Orson Wells&quot;The Pearl&quot; by John Steinbeck&quot;The Devil&apos;s Dictionary&quot; by Ambrose BierceSome  short stories I really like are:&quot;The Ministers Black Veil&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne&quot;The Pit and The Pendulum&quot; by Edgar Allen Poe&quot;Dark  They Were, and Golden-Eyed&quot;, by Ray Bradbury&quot;Mask of  The Red Death&quot; by Edgar Allen Poe  And finally, some of  my favorite poets are:Edgar Allen PoeEmily DickensonEdgar Lee MastersWalt Whitman;Thanks for contribuing, guys. Pedro, I can&apos;t find the Skilful Hunter, does it go by another name, by any chance?;It&apos;s from the Margaret Taylor translation, that&apos;s why I couldn&apos;t find it. Since we&apos;re working with Lucy Crane&apos;s version, it&apos;s not part of the corpus. Still, it&apos;s notable that these traits we can see in our selection also appear in other Grimm&apos;s stories. So thank you for noticing it.  ;That&apos;s an interesting take. Now that I think of it, the tales don&apos;t feature cats alongside humans, do they? Dogs, wolves, horses, cows, all sorts of birds, but no cats, which seems like a medieval approach - cats were considered witch companions that helped spreading the plague, and thus were mercilessly  slaughtered, especially black ones... Wonder when they returned to favour as human companions and mice killer machines;I don&apos;t know if it would count as cat-companion, but a cat mentions a mistress in The Bremen Town Musicians:&quot;Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt, and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice, and my mistress wanted to drown me;&quot;;</string>
            <string>mmmmm.... favorite books and authors... that list is constantly changing for me; right now that list includes authors like Kurt Vonnegut (my first and only tattoo - so far - says &quot;so it goes&quot;), Stephen King, Margaret Atwood, Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Cort  zar, Alan Moore, and Jane Austen (I love everything related to this woman).As for books, I love &quot;American Gods&quot; (Neil Gaiman), &quot;Maus&quot; ( Art Spiegelman, I&apos;m   a big comic book and graphic novel fan), Love in the Times of Cholera (Garc _a Marquez), The War of the End of the World (Mario Vargas Llosa), Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen), The Shining (King), The Hellbound Heart (Clive Barker), The Handmaid&apos;s Tale (Margaret Atwood), Fahrenheit 451 (Bradbury), The Godfather (Mario Puzzo), Slaughterhouse 5, (Kurt Vonnegut) and many more.I also like horror movies, tv shows like Dr. Who, Sherlock, Arrested Development and How I met Your Mother, video games, soccer (watching, not playing), and music. I&apos;m actually taking a coursera course on the history of rock, it&apos;s a great class. ;Hi everyone!

            <string>I have read Grimms Fair Tales before, not sure which translation it was. I&apos;m getting it from the library today because I love the feel of a book and not reading it off the computer screen. There&apos;s just something about the feel of a good book. What I do remember about the Grimm Fairy tales is this: there were lessons to be learned in each story. And the one person that said that these are the TRUE fairy tales and not the Disney versions is correct. Take &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; for instance. I believe that this was a Hans Christian Anderson tale, not a Grimm one, but it&apos;s still essentiality the same concept: instead of a happy ending for the mermaid with her prince, she has to kill the woman that he married or both of them (it&apos;s been a while since I read the story). I remember lividly, in the story  she is  standing over them and decides that she loves him too much to go through with it and becomes one with the ocean. It wasn&apos;t a happy ending.;</string>

            <string>Since I&apos;ve already read Frankenstein on my own, twice, I thought I would concentrate on the Hawthorne/Poe for the next two weeks. And that&apos;s a lot of reading! I&apos;ll be only focusing on 2 of Poe&apos;s work and concentrate on Hawthorne&apos;s since I haven&apos;t read any of his works before (may have back in High school, but don&apos;t remember). I may go back and finish the stories after I get done with this class. ;Like I said, I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;ve ever read any of his stuff before, so it&apos;ll be interesting. I&apos;ve read Dracula back in Jr High because I wanted to, and yes, I&apos;m a bookworm! I&apos;m actually surprised that he didn&apos;t have any of Verne&apos;s stuff for us to read. I read his stuff because I wanted to, not because I was forced to. I do like to expand my mind, but that&apos;s a lot of reading that he&apos;s putting us through in only a week&apos;s time. ;</string>

            <string>I saw that too. It&apos;s like no one stays put, at least for long. The main characters are generally moving (or at least not staying put.);Besides the class readings, I&apos;m finishing up The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov. Also just finished 1Q84 by Murakami. This is a book I&apos;m recommending to just about anybody who like to read. I loved it.;How are you liking Blindness? It&apos;s on my TBR mountain; I might just move it forward and read sooner.;If you would like to see some samples from previous students simply go to the Course Wiki. The button can be found on the left hand side menu. Once in the Wiki you will see that there a number of students who have posted a portfolio of their short essays. They may help you in structuring your own essays.;Usually MLA is used for English classes (and the humanities.);Hi! I&apos;m Catherine and I teach Intro Composition and Intro Lit at a local community college on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I also teach Communications at our local College, Salisbury University. Thanks for starting up this thread.;I&apos;m here for personal and professional reasons. I love SF/Fantasy and have for a very long time. But I never had the time to really study this genre. So...here I am. Professionally, I want to see how this MOOC works and want the experience of analyzing literature and writing to a deadline. It will help me help my students that much more.;One thing that did jump out at me is that the forest is a place of transformation and change. It&apos;s not always positive, but it&apos;s not always negative. The forest is that place to which the characters go and then return in some other form or with other skills/accomplishments/possessions/thoughts. It&apos;s a place of enchantment.;Calibre is a very useful app. I use it as a library for my books and I&apos;ve got books in all kinds of formats. Then I can load them on   my Kindle when I want to read them.;On the top of the page, on the right hand side, you will find your name.

There is a button labeled &quot;Unenroll&quot;. That will drop you from the course.;Maybe you could just read the works that really intrigue you now, participate in the discussion groups,  and  not submit any essays. Then, at a later date, you could take the course again. When you take the course again you would be ahead of things because you&apos;ve already read some of the works and could submit your essays with a little less effort.;I use a Kindle Fire but have also downloaded the Kindle app on   my laptop. Using the laptop app has made it easier to go back and forth as I wrote the essay. Actually, I was able to open to two different stories by using the PC app and my Kindle Fire. I even have the Kindle app on my cell/mobile phone. That way I could even have the book open to three different places at once.     ;)  What I really use the phone app for is reading while waiting in various lines.;</string>
            <string>All the versions I found of the tales had lots of typos and errors that I just decided to read them on my computer. Starting with Alice, I just decided to read the free versions Amazon offers.;Nancy, You made my day!! I resemble your comments! Thanks.;Spell checkers are great for a first run-through of a rough draft, but spell check and grammar check apps are not perfect. They miss many errors; spellcheck will miss homonym errors, for example, your and you&apos;re or there, their, and they&apos;re. Each one of these examples is spelled correctly but may not be the correct word for your meaning. Comma splices in particular are often missed in grammar checkers (and I&apos;ve noticed a few of these in both the essays and discussion posts.) The best editing is simply reading through your own essay very carefully and then asking someone else to read it.;I read both together. Spoilers don&apos;t bother me and I like to be able to compare my ongoing impressions with what I&apos;m picking up from extra readings. It&apos;s also a time thing; doing both together saves time and allows me to get it all done in the  few days  we have.;People learn and process information in different ways. Some learn/process more through words/language and some learn/process better when they can see pictures. It has nothing to do with their maturity level, it has to do with how they process information and find meaning in a text. As a teacher, I&apos;ve had to learn to address the different learning styles of my students and provide opportunities for those who learn/process in ways other than linguistic. Some of those other ways incorporate physical movement, music, pictures/visuals (including graphing), and numbers. I prefer words which is why I like to read a book first and then, maybe, see the movie made from the book (that is for books made into movies!) I just like to form my own images in my head. There are others who want to have those pictures/images that will help them process the words. Again, this doesn&apos;t have to do with maturity or intelligence, just learning/processing styles.;Thank you for these. I have recommended the Purdue OWL site to all my Intro to Comp classes and the students find it very helpful. The others will go into my list of recommended sources.;</string>
            <string>I think there is more of Christianity in this story than we think. True there aren&apos;t any overtly religious figures in the story, there are some theological themes. One of those themes is compassion - an almost &quot;love your enemy&quot; approach. This comes from Mina at the end of the novel when the group is reflecting on Dracula and how they are going to defeat him. She says about Dracula, &quot;...it is not   a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all. ... You   must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction&quot; (p. 272-3 in Kindle edition). They also discuss how destroying Dracula will actually free his soul for eventual salvation; free it from the hell it is in currently. So there are also issues of salvation in the story too.;</string>
            <string>Thank you so much for this link. I&apos;ve been looking for a really good example to show my writing students.;</string>
            <string>The Coursera word count is off as it does count possessives, etc as two words, but then, we do have some padding in that 320 upper limit of words. I don&apos;t know how many words over you can go, but we can write a little more than 320 and still be able to submit our essays. So, I use the word count in Word and then paste into Coursera. If I&apos;m within the 320 count in Word I haven&apos;t had any problems with submitting my essay on Coursera. That extra word padding may take into account Coursera&apos;s idiosyncrasies.;Interesting! Just posted my Hawthorne/Poe essay and the Coursera word counter counted it at exactly 320 words. I didn&apos;t plan it that way.;My Word program counted 312 words.;Interesting comment. I hadn&apos;t thought of it this way. Thank you!;Poe may have had some fear of being buried alive. There are a few of his stories that feature premature burial. According to Wikipedia (yea, I know, not exactly the most accurate, but still helpful  ;)) there were actual, recorded cases of premature burial before science came to the point of being able to verify death. There are probably more urban legends about this than real, true cases, but it was still a major fear.;I tried to read Solaris a few weeks ago and just couldn&apos;t get in to it. I wanted to read it, but it didn&apos;t appeal to me. I may have to look for Star Diaries and give that a go.;I got a lot of essays on &quot;The Birthmark&quot; also. It could be that it struck a chord in people; it is a good story with many levels and layers to it. It could also be that this story is one of the first ones mentioned in the reading list (says the cynic in me!);</string>
            <string>I added you. I live in Holiday, too! About a 30-45 minute drive. How funny, eh?;I don&apos;t keep up with mine very well, but here is mine also:   http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7405299-stephanie;</string>
            <string>I just submitted my essay, and had typed it up into four paragraphs, but when I reviewed my submission, it&apos;s one huge chunk of text.

            <string>I don&apos;t usually review the books I read, but I do use Goodreads as a reading control tool. So here is mine:  http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4094328-jude;Hey..Snow White and Goblin Market! Yeah except for common and everyday fairy tales there wasn&apos;t any particular intertextuality as far as my part goes... It&apos;d be great if you could come up with more!;</string>
            <string>I wrote a paper on goblin market years ago, and I wish I had thought to title it &quot;tales of a fruit ho&quot;;Angela Carter&apos;s The Magic Toyshop is wonderful and full of allusions to a lot of fairytales (Bluebeard and Snow White are the most evident, though)!;I actually wrote a paper for a conference last semester about how Dracula is a representation of the New Woman.   I think it is safe to say that Mina does have qualities of the New Woman; however, there are also several ways in which she does not fit the mold of a New Woman.   For example, the NW was an advocate for women being able to enter the male sphere outside of the home and Mina, though she does this, is not an advocate of it, but rather does it out of necessity.   You might also notice that Mina is put nicely back into her place at the end of the novel; she has a child and is happily married to Harker, she no longer has to hunt vampires, so she can now stay at home.   Not really the picture that the NW had for themselves.   I do agree with you that she possesses both the masculine brain and feminine heart and with those qualities together in one body represents a sort of masculine woman, but not really a NW in the true sense of that label.   ;</string>
            <string>There are notes to the side of the lectures that will allow you to pull up a notepad screen with the transcription of the lecture in it.   You can copy and paste that into any translation generator online or on your computer if you have one and it would translate.   You would have to read it though.   ;John, I would tend to agree with your analysis of Mina.   And yes, my thesis for the conference paper was that Dracula himself could be read as a New Woman.   He is masculie and feminine at once, sexual (a big no no for the women of the Victorian era), etc.   I&apos;m hoping to source it out for publication when I have the time to lengthen it (which is probably what I should be doing instead of taking classes online for fun in my summer off).  ;Dracula is an epistolary novel, which means it is composed of letters, notes, etc.   It is written in this way to give the reader many different points of view and also to allow the reader to come to their own conclusions about what is happening.   At the time that Dracula was written, the novel was also a relatively new genre, so that may account for the use of letters as well.   ;No.   I didn&apos;t even read the book again.   I read it when I was younger and didn&apos;t like it, so I kind of skipped the reading.   Then I wrote the essay this morning in about ten minutes.   Sorry to whoever has to peer review that mess.   ;</string>
            <string>The being, in my opinion, is the more sympathetic character throughout the novel.   However, depending on where you are (I&apos;ll not spoil it for you if you aren&apos;t there yet) there is an instance where Dr. F. can be read as attempting to redeem himself and taking responsibility for his actions.   In this instance he refuses the being something at great detriment to himself.   While I still think Dr. F. comes off badly overall, this scene in the novel does point to his &quot;growing up&quot; in a way.   ;</string>
            <string>This is a great idea. Here&apos;s my GR account http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14796545-veleka-georgieva and I have already sent friends requests to everybody here.;</string>
            <string>The first one, &quot;waked up&quot; I believe is a product of languages changing over time. There are times our past tense form of a verb changes as more people use one or another. I would assume &quot;waked up&quot; is a earlier version of &quot;woke up&quot; which is used more commonly now. (I keep finding books where people &quot;lighted up&quot; rooms and it throws me every time because I want them to write &quot;lit up.&quot; For all I know, I&apos;m the one in the wrong.For the second, I have noticed if you&apos;re reading the Guttenburg version that I am, it was scanned and there are a lot of typos where the scanner thought it saw one letter or symbol instead of the correct one. I&apos;m can&apos;t think of another one off hand, but in this case, it would be easy for the scanner to read &quot;upon thereof to wait&quot; rather than &quot;upon the roof to wait&quot; which makes more  grammatical  sense. Especially as he wanted a place to &quot;spring down upon her.&quot;That&apos;s the catch with free ebooks, they often just scan the text and hope the program reads it correctly, but unless someone goes through and notices that a mark or smudge in the book changed the shape of letters, the error will be there.;</string>
            <string>If you&apos;re concerned that the essay you are reviewing goes way over the word limit. Check it before giving it a score of 1. False  accusations  are no good and they might be within the 10% limit which means that up to 350 words might be accepted by the system.There&apos;s lot of quick online word counters where you can just paste in the text and be sure that it goes over. Just a quick google search gave me many options. The first was:  http://www.wordcounter.net/  ;I would caution folks who want to write in their native language and then run their essay through an online translator. While the programs have improved greatly over the years, they are not very good when you have difficult sentences. For example I wrote the sentence &quot;The girl sitting under the plane lost her wallet when the dog barked.&quot; Then I translated into another language (Japanese), then I translated the Japanese back to English. &quot;Girl sitting under the barked plane lost her purse the dog&quot; is what came back. The translators probably do better with languages that are similar to English. But they can make for a less  intelligible  essay than if you limit yourselves just to the words and phrases you know.;Mathematically speaking. You can&apos;t get a 1 on the essay. The lowest you can get is a 2 overall score if everyone gave you 1 in form and 1 in content.  There&apos;s probably some rounding but not much since the numbers are so small. No one reviewer can give a fractional score since the two halves are added. So the fractions only happen when all the reviewer&apos;s score are added.Getting something like a 2.2 would be unusual, but not mathematically impossible if you had more than 4 reviewers. If no one gets a 2.2 then perhaps they are rounding those overall scores, but they&apos;re not rounding off the individual score you give.;Nope. You can only get the grades for each section and then the overall. There&apos;s no way to know the individual reviewer gave.;I was one of those reviewers who mentioned in comments that the citation of the book wasn&apos;t necessary - but I never marked anyone down  because  of it. It&apos;s good to realize that I should be careful in the future to mention when something is an FYI comment rather than a improvement comment. Especially as I see that no one knows what score you actually gave the person for a single item. Only the overall score from all the reviewers is shown. I think improving how we give feedback will be just as important as improving our writing.My hope is that the score overall averages out the  occasional  weird reviewer.;I managed to get my down to 318, but lost some phrases that I really liked. But since they weren&apos;t necessary, they had to go.  ;I didn&apos;t mark anyone down for having no citations and I don&apos;t plan to since citations are not a requirement.That said, I also know that when I read an essay with citations I did give it a higher content score. That was  because  the essay brought up more interesting and thought-provoking ideas, and things that I didn&apos;t know or think of myself. It enriched my understanding of the text in new ways. I think it&apos;s very possible to write a thought provoking (ie content score 3) essay  without citing additional sources, but I think it&apos;s harder since you can only rely on common knowledge and the book. I also know I put more effort and thought into my essay this week than last and I included additional citations this time.;</string>
            <string>Hi everyone!! My GR profile is  https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426548-creative-mindI just joined the group and added you as friends! :-);Soy de Monterrey, t  ?:);Otro mexicano por ac  , vivo en Guadalajara.   Saludos, compatriotas!;Hola a todos, de Ecuador. ;Thank you!!!;Oh, sorry, forgot to mention - it&apos;s Ukrainian and Russian in equal measure :);One of the most striking things for me in Grimm tales was that whenever a prince saw a beautiful girl, he immediately asked her to marry him without a second thought and the girl agreed without any hesitation. Isn&apos;t it wonderful that life is so simple in those tales?;If I had to pick one, I will have to go with Red Riding Hood.   But this is based on the version I read as a kid, which is of course a much lighter version than Grimm&apos;s.   A psychology professor and friend of mine once told me that the  stories you remember from childhood  say something about your &apos;life script&apos; and the  tales stick to you because they are archetypal.    For example, the Cinderella theme appear in different cultures.   I think I read somewhere that that&apos;s how the brothers Grimm compiled the stories - they traveled, listened to storytellers, then wrote an integrated version of the tales.;</string>

            <string>When i was young my mum obviously used to read fairy tales to me but that tradition sort of died after i grew up and then she used to be behind my back to read books. Then one day she got this series called &apos;Harry Potter&apos; and just so that she would back off i started reading it but within like the first few pages i got bored and i put it aside and went back to Tv and games and what not. This happened around 5 times before she decided to read the series out to us and by the time she finished the fourth book I had started reading. I cant thank her enough for pushing me into this! Reading offers so many things! You meet new people, see new places and what not! Its best escape mechanism for anyone :);</string>
            <string>I sometimes use Goodreads to follow groups, but largely discontinued my use after the Amazon purchase.   So I might be a bit absent in my participation there, but it does have good forum support.;</string>
            <string>Hi everybody!I&apos;m still filling up my book list, but I made the GR account last week! This is my profile:http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20656932-emmaI just joined the group, it&apos;s a great idea!Emma;Hmm seems like there needs to be a whole course dedicated to this topic alone! I agree with you Kim in terms of defining sci fi and fantasy, one being scientific and one being magical but as you say, there are always crossovers.  I think there are many cases in which literature can be utopian or dystopian and sci fi or fantasy and yet some that are neither. It&apos;s quite a blurred topic which always allows for good debate :)  Thanks for the new titles there Kim, there are a few I haven&apos;t heard of, now to find the time to read them all!  ;</string>
            <string>I agree. I have read some really mature YA books. And I did the same as Kim. I wondered to the adult section and was rather surprised and cautious after that. I think people should just read and not base things on categories. We are so hung up on the names and categorization and image of something, that we just can&apos;t enjoy it. Sorry end rant/;Tegan, you are correct.   I&apos;m sorry I wasn&apos;t clear.I was replying to a thread that included my earlier post.   I consider Speculative Fiction to be a meta-category that includes Utopian/Dystopian fiction.   (That&apos;s one of the categories I missed in my listing)However, I also believe that Utopian/Dystopian fiction often falls within either an SF or Fantasy sub-category of Speculative Fiction, depending on features like:1) Emphasis on technology (SF) vs. magic (Fantasy) -- recognizing the qualifier, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;2) Known tropes (time travel is a staple of SF, dragons are a staple of fantasy)3) Era of setting, or equivalent era based on technology level (SF is typically, but not always, set in the future.   Fantasy typically involves a setting that reflects fuedalism or other historical eras).And recognizing that the distinction is not always so clear.In earlier posts I mentioned the argument that Star Wars is Fantasy rather than SF.   It&apos;s set in the past, the original trilogy included a feudalistic society (the Empire), it includes magic (the Force), and it operates via Jungian archetypal characters.Karen is correct that The Handmaid&apos;s Tale doesn&apos;t get into technology much.   I still consider it part of the SF sub-group of speculative fiction, but that relies on the not-strong argument that it is a far-future setting.   Perhaps the stronger argument is that, like much good SF, it provokes thought about our philosophies of society.;Kim, thanks for the link re  blog post  - very insightful!;I would nominate Peter S. Beagle as a writer of modern fairy tales, including some in short fable format.I am definitely also seeing novel length stories that come across as modern fairy tales/fables, such as Alif the Unseen (which I recommend reading);I&apos;m going to be honest, my biggest worry about these assignments is the instructions ask us to not make connections to things outside the stories, and it will be very easy to accidentally do that.;I recommend reading the book Clever Maids which is about the role the sisters of the Brothers Grimm played in their compilations.;Is there a preferred citation (b/c of the year issues) for the assigned reading in this case?   I&apos;ve got my essay done except for citing the Grimms.;If your local library does not have copies, there is a very good chance they can request them for you through Inter Library Loan.;Did anyone else notice the connections in this story to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen?;The whole battle with the Turks is started because of a race against the clock to get the finest bottle of wine with the Baron&apos;s life on the line.   The fastest man takes a nap on the way, and the man with the best eye sight shoots halfway around the world to wake him up, the strongest man carries off the whole treasury, and the man with great breath blows the soldiers away.I will admit that Baron Munchausen and Time Bandits are both Terry Gilliam films that I adore.   But perhaps I enjoy bizarre films.   :DI am not familiar with Troll Valley, I will have to look it up.;Be wary of anyone who eagerly accepts what you know to be an unfair deal?;The last class I took had peer-reviewed assignments and I liked it, though I was left with a feeling of possibly being an over achiever based on the comparison between what I had submitted and about 2/3 of the essays I graded.   That being said even the ones that didn&apos;t seem to really go deep enough to answer the question asked made for fascinating reading.   Our final was to analyze a disruptive technology and an area that it effects, so very intriguing and informative answers.;I just want to say that the essays I&apos;ve evaluated are significantly higher quality than I&apos;ve encountered in my previous experience with peer-reviewing in MOOCs.   Awesome.;I&apos;m a huge Sendak fan, and one of my favorites of his books from my childhood is his illustration of the &apos;found&apos; fairy tale from a letter, Dear Mili.   I haven&apos;t found a copy of the story in a Grimms compilation, only as the picture book (though I haven&apos;t looked recently).   I recommend reading it if you get the chance and like fairy tales.   It is both beautiful and unsettling.http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/books/books-of-the-times-maurice-sendak-s-mark-upon-a-grimm-tale.h...Google Bookshttp://books.google.com/books/about/Dear_Mili.html?id=Bjq694-wJ_wCSendak also did quite a bit with fairy tales and fables, both interpretations of other&apos;s stories and of his own.I didn&apos;t intend for this post to overlap with Sendak&apos;s birthday, but I guess sometimes coincidence happens.   If you haven&apos;t looked at today&apos;s Google animation/artwork I recommend swinging by google.com;Yay!   Glad this is something others are interested in.;I&apos;m in another class that actually requested that if English is not your first language to write it in your native language, run it through a translator, then put a note at the top of the essay explicitly noting the translation so that the graders would know.If it&apos;s odd word choices or grammar use I&apos;d be likely to assume different language, the people with whom I play video games online that speak a different language natively tend to spell better than I do!   In intelligible spelling is likely to be flagged by me for reduced score especially with in-browser word checking;</string>
            <string>There&apos;s also quite a bit of evidence that he was quite a ladies man and so that in many cases his friendships with children were promoted to hide the fact that a gentleman was so flagrantly sleeping his way through the ladies of his acquaintance.;And I fully acknowledged that my spelling is lacking.   I&apos;m actually not sure why I wrote &quot;in intelligible&quot; instead of &quot;unintelligible&quot; unless I selected utterly the wrong option from the spell check options.   And where in that statement do I state that this is a &quot;no-compromise&quot; stance?   I say that unintelligible spelling &quot;is likely to be flagged&quot; not definitely, more that it is something to look for over all in the whole paper.   In this very forum thread I have seen impeccable spelling and grammar by self-professed non-native English speakers.   The comment I made about spelling is irregardless of native speech, though I also assume people will take slightly more care in proof-reading an assignment submission than a forum post.   The statement I made on word choice or grammar is due to different sentence structures inherent in different languages that don&apos;t quite translate (in case you are wondering, I&apos;ve been told I sound like a clown when speaking Spanish... once the person stopped laughing at me).Thanks for being overly critical and judgmental.;I&apos;ve never really enjoyed Dracula as a novel, but I&apos;m giving it a try as it has been years since my last endeavor to read it.;I loved that when I read it several years ago.   Very interesting book.That being said, I think there is enough material just based on the interpretations and inspirations drawn from Alice for a full course.   I refrained from using &apos;Alice as inspiration&apos; for my essay because I knew I couldn&apos;t do it in under 300 words and in the amount of time allotted.   ;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t know the edition, but the first version of Dracula that I read had an essay in the beginning about how Dracula stood out from the Vampire novels of the time for not being particularly erotic or homosexual in content.   Apparently vampires were often used as a way to write lesbian erotica (particularly using Lamia).   The premise being that they weren&apos;t erotica or pornographic b/c they were &quot;horror&quot;.;</string>
            <string>Oh, I missed the most recent humble ebook bundle!   I actually own most of them in print already though...Doctorow also makes all of his books available for free on his site http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/;Anyone else pick up on that before the monster is brought to life he is described as being beautiful?   That the point at which Frankenstein recoils in disgust is when the eyes are opened for the first time?;</string>

I would like to expand some of the thoughts I started in my mini essays for this class, but that will likely not start until after this class is over so I can stay on top of the readings for this class and finish the books I review.libromancersapprentice.blogspot.com if anyone feels like wandering over (though the most recent post as of writing this is not all that interesting, just a link round up).;We&apos;re not going to talk about my &quot;to read&quot; list, or about the Advanced Reader Copy I spent about half of last week into this weekend reading instead of Hawthorne and Poe.I&apos;ve recently been getting into more NF since I started working Reference and having my own NF areas to order.   Then I decided we needed to have NF book displays... and while not every book put on display is one I want to read it is not helping me keep that future reading list short.I&apos;m enjoying visiting the blogs people have been sharing.;Me?

            <string>I&apos;m in the process or listening to Ender&apos;s Game on audio book.   It&apos;s a book I really like, but I do have trouble sometimes reconciling my enjoyment of the text with the author&apos;s real world intolerance.I would like to recommend a book for those really interested in Ender&apos;s Game - Ender&apos;s World : Perspectives on the SF Classic Ender&apos;s Game, it has some fascinating essays on the book.   I wrote a review on an advanced reader copy a little while back:http://libromancersapprentice.blogspot.com/2013/01/book-review-enders-world-fresh.html;While I have seen some fantastic essays, I have definitely started seeing more poorly written essays than when I started the class.   That being said, when I started the class I was blown away by the quality of the essays I was reviewing compared to previous experiences with MOOCs and peer reviewing.   Perhaps that&apos;s just the mix that I have received.   I know the quality of my own essays has suffered somewhat as I juggle life and the readings, so I am unsurprised at not receiving 6&apos;s.;</string>

            <string>Buena idea, as _ podemos ayudarnos y mejorar.;Hola!   Se habla tambien.;I have an important rule: read the piece in the original language whenever possible. Since most of the books in this course were originally written in English, I&apos;ve read or will read them in English.

            <string>Hola, soy de Chile!!!! :);</string>
            <string>Hola desde Colombia;</string>
            <string>I felt the sacrifice of the children was the biggest provement of reward from being faithful to the king. Kids were the most preacious treassure for the king so for me the fact that the king agrees to sacrifice their sons in reward to john&apos;s faithfulness to him shows how gratefull and concious he was about john and the sacrifice he did for the king so he could be safe and happy.It was very surprising for me when the queen also agreed thinking that she was not as involved with john as the king, but truth is john also save her from death when she danced at her wedding. I also feel important that the king tests his queen to see her reaction about the sacrifice. That proves how the queen also had a kind and grateful heart about john&apos;s sacrifice for them and their happyness. Regardless of all i think these fairytales are very intense, cruel , deep and shoking... but im kinda understanding what means to protect kids from reality and what is it to expose them to reality. I feel that is the main point of grimm&apos;s brothers with their tales. Life could be as dreamful as a fairytale and as cruel too.;I think you are right. For me it has been unbeliavable to think these tales were for kids to teach them and I never thought about the historical context when they were written. With that on mind now i really think it changes completely my perspective. Although still is insane how extremist the stories are. If you don&apos;t do what you were suppossed to you die, or you lose something that you will never get back. Very intransigent.;I felt it more as an example of how happiness is something different for everyone. Most of us believe happiness is to be rich, get marry (hopefully being in love), have power and a recognized name. This is what society teaches you since you are born. Is mostly impossible for people to understand others who would not consider this things to be happy in life. Truth is I&apos;ve seen: the richer you are, the poorer your soul is, the less happy you are.As the story goes you can see how all the men who trade things to Hans, knew exactly they were fooling him. Hans never undestood this because he trusted, maybe feeling everyone would think as he did. He was not happy carrying all those heavy things, because those things were not filling his needs on his way back home, so for him there was no point on carrying them. They were not worthy. The whole way back home the challenge for him was to be able to do it without hunger or thirst. At the end none of the things he got on his way helped him not being thirsty or hungry. He was happy because he couldnt believe how all these people he knew on his way were helping him on his problems, he felt he was blessed. At the end i guess if he would have felt hungry or thirsty again, probably he would have found a job and work again to have food and a place to stay, as simple as the basic things we need to live.;Thanks for sharing those wonderful wise verses. It is always a pleassure when they come meet you on our way. Is like a blessing.I think Hans did not feel the gold as a reward( or his fruit), only the fact that he got something in exchange of his loyal service was. I think he had an inner simplicity that guided him to be happy and feel gratefull everytime he felt the need of something and someone came to &quot;help him&quot; out. Maybe his duty was only to arrive home save and healthy after all the time being away from it.When i first read it, i was wondering where was his stupidity gonna lead him and after finishing it, i felt a little embarassed with myself for thinking he was stupid.I realized how we sometimes feel or consider people stupid just because they dont see the things as we do or they dont value things as we do.This is the main reason why I ended up liking this fairytale a lot.;Sorry guys, but from all the stories ive read so far, this is the one I haven&apos;t understand at most. The Hen made a promise to the cock. She doens&apos;t mantain it, the cock does everything to save her but she dies. Everyone sees how the cock is sad and they help him to burry her and all of them end up dead, and the cock ends up dying of sadness.Why does everyone die? Why the cock doesnt feel angry because the Hen didnt keep her promise? What are all those animals at the end? Did you guys notice that all of these animals from the list were listed like a chain of food? the first after the cock could have eaten him, and so on till the las one who could have eaten all of them... maybe this means nothing, but still why do they suddenly appear on the story and make company to the sad cock..?;</string>
            <string>As a person who has half of the family from germany I never felt ofended by the explanation of Professor Rabkin. Nationalism is not a stricted related thing to anitsemitism. As I read in some comments above,is true that   nationalism is a term used by more than just germany during history. I recomend you should read more about other countries.I do not think and feel an intemption of &quot;subconcious&quot; politic influence on the fairy tales at all. Also if you felt that way I dont see nationalism as a bad thing either. People naturally feel the need to belong to something or somewhere, so as being part of a religion, so as being part of a specifical style of music, so as try to maintain a certain language from the ancestors, etc. The problem remains when people try to adjust other people to their rules, or their way of living life or their believings.Is true Germany had a very strong period where nationalism was the main argument to manipulate people for certain behaviour. If you read books about it, you can see there&apos;s a lot of arguments to explain why germans were so vulnerable that they ended up believing Hitler&apos;s Ideology.if we are reasonable, every country has had issues in this matter. Perhaps not having the consequence of the huge genocide we had, but still something from what we could read and learn after. If you stop and start reading the story from africa you will be surprised of how many tribes had been killed because of racism. Don&apos;t get me wrong,I don&apos;t want to give a feeling of a justification from the Holocaust, because it was an horrendous thing and Germany certanly is not proud of it at all. But as german I didn&apos;t feel offended or particulary attacked or touched by the subject of natonalism.;</string>

            <string>Hola! Soy Julieta de Mendoza, Argentina! Hola a los amigos hispanohablantes!Un abrazo;I don&apos;t think that science fiction has lost it&apos;s awesomeness at all. It&apos;s true that in the past technology was limited and even simple things like cell phones and even in some cases computers seemed liked it was truly out there. Science or better the honest pursuit of truth is limited by reality, But science fiction is the imagination of science and it is only limited by the authors imagination. I think that the more truth we discover the more room we make for some truly imaginative science fiction.   Science fiction grows with true science. As science finds what once was thought to be fiction as truth , the science fiction authors are pushed and challenged to keep things moving forward.The awesomeness of it is found in the potential for some science fiction to become science non-fiction.That my view on it all ;I think one of Sci-Fi&apos;s obstacles nowadays is that readers are very science savvy; enough not to be impressed by technobabble. Another issue would be, as a science-savvy reader, I&apos;d be curious about how things work, and getting an unsatisfactory explanation might make it harder to suspend my disbelief.;I did, in fact, think about looking into Audible. The problem I ran into was that either they didn&apos;t have the book I was looking for, or they had multiple versions and I couldn&apos;t tell which one I needed. And you&apos;re right -- it would get pretty expensive. However, I have a terrible audio book habit already, and part of me doesn&apos;t mind feeding it with classics for a class. The trick is making sure that I&apos;m getting the same electronic copy as the audio copy I&apos;m listening too, so I can look up quotes and references later. Audio books are much easier on my eyes, but more difficult for me to take notes with. And no page numbers, of course. :D;Similarly, I would call &quot;The Handmaiden&apos;s Tale&quot; a dystopian SF, but &quot;The Fifth Sacred Thing&quot; by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden&apos;s Tale.Thinking about it, though it was clunky in places, the thing that really delighted me about The Fifth Sacred Thing was the tension between the imperfect yet Utopia-seeking community of the north which focuses on co-operation, equality, and non-violence, and the Dystopian, rigidly stratified theocracy in the south - and the fact that it was through non-violent means that the southern forces were either repelled or persuaded to defect. It&apos;s really rare to have creative non-violent protagonists win the day.  Though Atwood&apos;s The Handmaid&apos;s Tale is set in the aftermath of the so-called &quot;terrorist attack&quot; which involved some kind of biological weaponry, it&apos;s always struck me as more along the speculative fiction-fantasy area of the spectrum than sci-fi, as there&apos;s no real discussion of that or other technology. And we&apos;re back to the slippery nature of genre-labelling :);</string>
            <string>I feel it would be fair if you submitted those again, unless you felt you would learn more from writing new ones? You will still learn from your reviews. If you have the time, though, to write something new then you can do that too?&quot;Happy Pavel&quot;         In a very large school, where everyone went to learn as earnestly as they could, one student called Pavel could not decide whether he could submit assignments he had previously submitted. He had been called back to the farm to work before he could finish his schooling the session before, but he missed the school badly.  He begged the farmer to allow him to go back to school, and the farmer allowed it. Pavel was happy! When Pavel got there, he found that all of the students were farther along than he, as it took him so long to come from the farm. Pavel loved the school, and he had written his assignments when he was there before. He asked the students if they thought it fair for him to turn in his assignments as he had done them before, and they said........;I find the tendency to ghettoise a load of fiction that would have just been on the SF&amp;F shelves in the library in my youth as &quot;Young Adult&quot;. I&apos;m just not a fan of the idea that we need to categorise books this way. Kids will read to their own level, and adults will tend to steer clear of some truly cook books that are labelled YA. My discovery of the YA shelves was by accident, and I&apos;ve found a load of books there that are just as clever, witty, thought provoking and absorbing as anything in the &quot;adult&quot; SF&amp;F shelves. There are books on the &quot;adult&quot; shelves that have adolescent protagonists, and books on the &quot;YA&quot; shelves with adult protagonists. The categorisation seems entirely random.So nowadays I look at the YA shelves as well.  ;Kim, have you tried any Tanith Lee?   Also, I agree on Tamora Pierce and Jane Yolen as phenomenal writers.   Pierce&apos;s books make fantastic audio books for commutes.I read Mists of Avalon in 3rd grade (hey, I was bored and needed something to read), so by the time I stumbled across Heinlein in middle school I was a little less shocked at the sexy times and more going &quot;ewww&quot; at the incest.   Most avid readers in about the same age group as myself that I&apos;ve talked to jumped from kids books to Anne Rice or Anne McCaffrey (I went the Pern route myself), we didn&apos;t really have access to &quot;YA&quot; books.   That being said I read a large number of &quot;YA&quot; titles and found some are just put there b/c they are PG in content (no graphic sex or profanity), and others are put there because they focus on teen characters often with a teen audience in mind... however if some of them are very graphic (The House of Night series doesn&apos;t shy away from teen&apos;s getting on).Confession time, I judge a library by if they have a dedicated SciFi/Fantasy section.   I&apos;m a librarian and I still do this.   Why?   Because I know exactly where to go if I have no clue what to read and grab something random off the shelf.   Since my current library pulled the SciFi and Fantasy out of the main stacks into their own section their circulation stats have skyrocketed, so I must not be the only one.;Speculative Fiction is a meta category, but that doesn&apos;t stop Utopian/Distopian fiction from being speculative.;Fair enough.   I have to side on the &quot;it could be either&quot; argument - in part depending on the concept of the utopia or distopia.   In my own digital bookshelving (mostly on Booklikes these days, only adding books I&apos;ve reviewed on Goodreads now) I have an shelf/tag for distopia that often is paired with sci-fi or with fantasy, and sometimes with neither.   I think I tend for more overlap with Science Fiction rather than Fantasy due to the number of books that use the folly of man combined with technology as the vehicle to explore distopian settings (or alternatively, used to explore how we could improve).   When you add in the post-apocalypse setting to distopian often the crisis is triggered by technology.   S. M. Stirling novels of the Change (Dies the Fire, etc) are based on fantasy but are more post-apocalyptic event rather than specifically utopia/distopian. Phillip K. Dick&apos;s distopian fiction, or Heinlein&apos;s utopian fiction are pretty solidly based in a sci-fi setting.;It strikes me as a smart move. So many people avoid certain genres because they&apos;re unfamiliar, or because they have ideas about SF&amp;F being for &quot;nerds&quot;, or literary fiction being &quot;difficult&quot;. I am definitely guilty of doing that at times. Yet the best moments are when you pick up a book you&apos;d never have gone for but for mis-shelving and discover that it&apos;s marvellous in its own right.;I forgot.   With regard to The Hunger Games...In my experience, humans injure each other easily enough, both accidentally and on purpose.   It&apos;s the killing that takes the extra practice.   BUT, it is much, much easier to &quot;sin by omission,&quot; to stand by and do nothing (or be unaware and oblivious) while another person dies.   In The Hunger Games, remember that most of Katniss&apos; &quot;kills&quot; are indirect.   SPOILERs: - She mentions that there was one set of games where the children simply sat around and starved to death.   It was considered the most boring games ever, so the arena-masters added &quot;features&quot; to prevent it from happening again.- She drops the tracker jacker nest on one crowd of children, and lets them die by wasp sting- She waits on the cornucopia all night, while the muttations slowly kill the last enemy childI&apos;m sure there are other examples./SPOILERSI&apos;ll second what the above poster said.   The second &amp; third book do get into the psychological aftermath of surviving.;Thanks, both of you - this is interesting stuff!  Kim - I have a couple of anthropologist friends who&apos;ve taught me that assumptions about graves and grave goods, &quot;hunter gatherer societies&quot;, and so on in the public consciousness are way behind what&apos;s going on in academia. One of them told me a brilliant story one of her lecturers told her about 20 years ago about visiting a remote tribe in an African nation. She discovered that ideas about their social structure and the emphasis on hunting were totally wrong and asked why. It turned out that the people realised that the white men who&apos;d come to see them in years past had firm views about how they lived, and weren&apos;t interested in anything that didn&apos;t fit that pattern, so they gave up and just &quot;told them what they wanted to hear&quot;, in part just to get rid of them. Oops...Faith - good to see that the books have more depth than I&apos;ve seen from the PR.  At some point, I&apos;m going to get round to reading the books. My list of books to read just never seems to get any shorter!;Yes, I always start by writing out my complete thoughts, and then use editing to put it within the word limit (adding detail or removing hedge-words).;We aren&apos;t writing fiction.   We are attempting to convey clear thoughts.As my business prof explained, fuzzy writing is a reflection of fuzzy thinking.I&apos;ve had assignments that ranged from 50 words to 10 pages.   Don&apos;t forget that while some of us are students with a lot of time, others of us are balancing a full-time job, a family, and graduate-level graded coursework.   270-320 words allows us to convey a complete thought, without requiring an all-nighter writing the paper.   It also respects the time of the paper reviewers.;Dobrie dyen!   Ochen priyatno!;YES, the Dark is Rising movie was *awful*, and I had SUCH high hopes - this has been an awesome century for good fantasy movies, now that the technology has caught up with our imaginations.I&apos;ve read most of Joseph Campbell&apos;s works, and I know whoever adapted The Dark is Rising was trying to fit it into some of the mythic journey, but they went overboard on formula and failed miserably.   Susan Cooper&apos;s book touches on the mythic quite well enough as it is.;For the AI Class, several of us were in touch via Twitter and Facebook as well, for general ideas.   Is there a Twitter account for this class?   Or a Facebook Group?;The video said that our papers are submitted anonymously.   The computer already has our name, and links it to the material submitted.   I would omit a header.;I don&apos;t think there are any rules against it.Similar to other here, I think before the paper is due (noon EST Tuesday) I would only post general thoughts, and wait to post your paper until after it&apos;s been submitted.;I agree with previous posters that the library would be my first choice.   I&apos;ve read &quot;The Left Hand of Darkeness&quot; from libraries at least twice before, and I don&apos;t think I own a copy yet.My libraries include a small &quot;Friends of the Library&quot; bookstore for cheap but not free, if you are lucky you might come across them there.   Or another used bookstore.Any chance that you have a birthday or anniversary this summer?   Would a friend or family member be willing to give you a copy for the occasion?   I know it&apos;s hard to ask.;It&apos;s hard to say.I was initially trained in a very formal (5-paragraph) essay format, in which one would NEVER use the word &quot;I&quot; in an essay about literatureThen I changed schools, and suddenly everyone wanted to know what I thought and what I felt.   I held on to the habit, though, and even got in trouble as an undergrad because my report on my internship never said what &quot;I&quot; did :)As an M.A. student, though, the &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot; was allowed, even (or perhaps especially) when writing about literature.But also review the video on writing expectations.   &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I feel&quot; don&apos;t lend themselves readily to a 270-320 word thesis on the book.   In a short paragraph like that, I would consider the phrases to be extraneous and unnecessary.   Of course this thesis tells what you think.;You can miss two essays and still get a certificate of completion.I&apos;ve been in at least one and sometimes two grad school classes since January, and this weekend was finishing my last major assignment.   Between that, work, family, etc, I&apos;ve been just slightly short on sleep for about 6 months now.   This is a light concluding week, and next week will be my one week off before my next summer class starts.   I decided to start catching up on sleep Monday instead of doing my Grimm essay.I plan to catch up and do an essay for Week 2, and will try to keep up after that.   (I may post a late Grimm essay in the discussion forum.)I do agree that Dracula is not a book I am eager to read.   My husband tried to watch the Bram Stroker&apos;s Dracula movie with me once in college, I made him turn it off in about 10 minutes.   That&apos;s very unusual for me.   While I don&apos;t like horror and rarely choose to watch it, with a group I&apos;ve usually been able to stick it out.;I have placed my one completed MOOC on my resume.I agree with the &quot;do your best and forget the rest.&quot;   I discovered I didn&apos;t have the programming language to complete my first Coursera listing.   I might retake it at a later date.   I hope to complete this one, but as I said in my intro, my graded classes take precedence.;Please, listen to Emma.   She&apos;s got it.One of the things I learned during my Humanities graduate coursework, is that NORMALLY (I had one professor who was an exception) the wrong answer is one that is a) incoherent or b) not supported by the evidence.;Oh good.   I&apos;m finishing up a term of grad school, and trying to be caught up for week 2.   It&apos;s good to know I can post an essay here.;</string>
            <string>These are the hard questions.   I think it&apos;s important to discuss these issues as adults, and even in secondary schools with adolescents.   I do have concerns with younger children.My son has inherited several of his grandfather&apos;s books, that we currently keep out of reach.   Some of them include archaic stories of things that I do not believe are okay.   Under my first premise (read for discussion of the issues around adolescence or later), I&apos;m currently storing them out of reach &amp; out of sight of my 5-yr-old.And yet, and yet.   Is it privilege that lets me wait, and not talk to him about these things yet?;And I read The Left Hand of Darkness *twice* in high school, and don&apos;t even remember the gender shifts.   It will be interesting to read it again now.;I came into the course knowing that Grimm&apos;s Household Tales were not pretty stories for children.  Even the Disney adaptations contain cruelty, if not on this scale.  I grew up knowing the story of Little Red Riding Hood (as Red Cap is known where I am), I knew that the wolf ate people up. To the original poster, I would advise not continuing the course.  If you think that the Grimm tales are bad, then Dracula, Poe, and The Invisible Man are much worse.  I am not a horror fan at all.  I&apos;ve done all right with Poe in written form, but most video adaptations take it a step further than I&apos;m comfortable with.  Still, horror is part of our imagination. You ask how we handle it.  I handle Grimm through separation - &quot;It&apos;s just a story, it&apos;s not real.&quot;  I agree with you that many of the punishments are horrible.  The sad part is, many of the things that happened, while fictionalized, have their roots in true human experiences.  Fairy Tales are rarely sweetness and light. ;I didn&apos;t &quot;get&quot; Alice as a child.   I enjoyed the poem Jabberwocky, and also memorized at least portions of it, but that&apos;s about it.I have seen Alice imagery in multiple places, from the Disney adaptation to the Muppet Show, to even Star Trek.   Many scientists have adopted the plays on words from Alice&apos;s adventures to describe the things they find, so that is another avenue that makes the stories worth reading for me.;Was anybody else reminded of the Angry Birds&apos; Bad Piggies when they saw the &quot;green pigs&quot; translation?Or am I just weird like that?;</string>
            <string>To me, it depends on whether they are citing one of the course texts, or an outside resource.For a course text (i.e., Household Tales), I agree that a minimal citation of author and title is enough.For an outside text or website, I think that more information (url or Title, Author, Publisher, Date, page number, etc.) is necessary.   However, I also don&apos;t think it would have to correspond exactly with MLA or other recognized citation style.;I learned it as a fun little nonsense poem.   Some of the words from the poem (gymbal comes to mind) have been adopted in the scientific community.But if you want a word-by-word explanation Alice repeats the poem towards the end of the book, and each word is explained to her.   I believe there&apos;s another thread on this forum that uses the translated words.;Keep in mind that most &quot;Modern Art&quot; was created in the early to middle 20th century.   Pablo Picasso lived from 1881 to 1973.   Salvador Dali lived from 1904 to 1989.   Many of their most famous works were created in the 1930&apos;s.   We&apos;re already past the &quot;Postmodern&quot; era of art.In addition to the choice to go with copyright-free material, I think the works that were selected still have a bearing on the world we live in today.   If you recall the lectures on Grimm, and how the Grimm brothers were working to bring about this idea of Germany as a nation... something that England and France had already done by the era of Joan of Arc (as learned from a Great Lectures course, &quot;Medieval Heroines in History and Legend&quot;).   The rise of Germany as a nation was pivotal to 20th century history, with not one but two World Wars.I&apos;m old enough to remember the 1980s and some of the later Nazi trials, and in particular the concept that &quot;Just following orders&quot; is not a valid justification for performing horrible acts of cruelty.   The two World Wars carried into the Cold War that lasted until about 1990.   Even 23 years later, the world is still adjusting to the realities of a post-Cold War era, the fall of the Soviet Union as a superpower... and the waking of China from isolationism to resume activity in world affairs.So much happens between the 17th century and today that are unprecedented in human history.;Oxana,Here is the link to the Great Courses webpage for that lecture series:  http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2937I was able to check it out from my local library, as a set of audio recordings on CD (it may be as many as 48 CDs long).   I played the recordings in my car on my commutes.   If you are interested in women in history and/or the medieval era, then I think it&apos;s worth your time to listen to them.   I definitely enjoyed the lectures and learned a great deal.   However, for a 19-year-old, I am not certain it is worth the $$$ to buy your own copy.As the link indicates, the lectures discuss Eloise and Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, Eleanor of Aquitane, Queen of England and France, and Joan of Arc.   I remember the comparison that in Eleanor&apos;s time, there wasn&apos;t a concept of France or England as distinct nations.   But that had changed by Joan&apos;s time.;I discussed this with some friends of mine who enjoyed B-rated horror movies.   The wife was Jewish, and explained that the concept of vampires is inherently Christian.If I understand her perspective properly, kosher meat is drained from blood.   Also, if I understand correctly, hallal meat is handled in a similar manner.   Both practices are an indication that drinking blood is anathema to both Jewish and Muslim beliefs.However, as has already been discussed here, the Catholic mystery of communion proclaims that the bread and wine are transformed into the Body &amp; Blood of Christ. This is true for both the Byzantine rites (Greek &amp; Russian Orthodox) and Roman Catholics.   Protestant beliefs on the subject vary widely.I do agree with David Grigg that the tools against vampires (crucifixes, the host) do seem to be equally effective for non-Christians.   There&apos;s an amusing moment in Buffy the Vampire Slayer when they have to uninvite a vampire from Willow Rosenberg&apos;s house, by nailing crosses beside the door.   Willow expresses concern over what her Jewish parents would think.The literature on vampires varies widely with regard to their powers and limitations.   In the case of Buffy, they had the vampires turn to dust in order to limit the number of bodies lying around during filming.;</string>
            <string>I saw Iron Man 3 and Star Trek: Into Darkness as reflecting the current events.Both seemed to me to include themes of soldiers returning home from war, of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the costs of surviving horrible events.   Both discuss terrorism and also betrayal.I&apos;ll do my best below to describe the two characters well enough to distinguish who they are without spoiling major plot points.   In one movie, the events are within the first 20 minutes.   In the other movie, the motivating background is not revealed until very late in the movie.Both Iron Man 3 and ST:ID include at least two traitor figures.   The two I am comparing betray their responsibilities in order to protect their daughters.   In ST:ID, the traitor is given a very slight sympathetic treatment.   His daughter was actually dying of some disease, his opportunity is to cure her completely, and just before he fulfills his end of the deal, he sends off a message telling who, what, and why.   The traitor of Iron Man 3 has none of these sympathetic elements.   I can&apos;t help comparing and contrasting these two characters with a recent public figure.I also found the Iron Man 3 use of the &quot;Mandarin&quot; character to be a wry political commentary.;The wolf that Dracula borrows in order to break the glass and remove the garlic from Lucy&apos;s window.;I did wonder, when I saw the professor&apos;s e-mail, about the children captivated by &quot;the bloofer lady&quot;.   It is true that they are not named... There seems to be a class (and possibly age) issue, since I gathered that the children (both the kidnapped and killed child in Transylvania and the injured children in London) were low-class peasants.   They were never named because they didn&apos;t &quot;count&quot; as people.I found it interesting that I saw a reference to a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.   For the curious, the children&apos;s rights and anti-child abuse movement arose out of the Animal protection movement, in the 19th century.   From what I have read so far, that seems to be after the Dracula era.;At least one legend has Athena sprung full-grown from Jupiter&apos;s head, and often displayed &quot;man-brain&quot;;These are good thoughts, and add to my comments in the &quot;no children in Dracula.&quot;The children shown so far (I&apos;m still on the hunt on the continent) have been working class at best.    I saw implications that the children bitten by &quot;miss bloofey&quot; were likely beggars, or just barely better.   And so they don&apos;t &quot;count&quot; as people, or characters.The wolf, Berserker, gets named and his kidnapping described, but these children are kept anonymous, unknown, barely-there figures.;I also am not participating in the writing portion *this* cycle.   As I said in my introduction, I am trying to focus my efforts on my job and my graded graduate-level class.I was hoping that I might fit essays into my schedule, but now that I have missed three it&apos;s too late to earn the certificate. I&apos;m still going to attempt to read along with the class.   I am not a slow reader, but life is interfering so that I am finishing the books a little late.  I also would not have tackled this reading list if it were not for this course.   Horror stories are not my cup of tea, I&apos;ve read too many that ended on terrifying notes rather than hopeful.   So I was surprised to find myself really getting into Dracula late in the book, curious about what happened. And yet I think I shouldn&apos;t have been surprised, as there are very few books I&apos;ve read for school assignments that I did not come to appreciate.I am enjoying the discussion forums and conversing about the books.   I&apos;m going to focus on the positive, and learn what I can.;Hi Laurie,I appreciate the concern, but I&apos;m not that interested this year.   I have a family, a full-time plus challenging and engaging job, and a graduate-level class that will consume the next 6 weeks.   Really, I&apos;m happy just reading the books right now.Thank you,;</string>
            <string>Many, many Americans I know are monolingual.   Sure, they&apos;ll take two years of foreign language in high school, and as little as they can get by with in college, but whatever they do learn, they forget as fast as possible.   I&apos;ve lived my life trying my best not to be one of these.So, even among advanced undergraduates, many Americans may actually NOT know the difference between British English and American English.   I&apos;ve met some college graduates that can barely spell American English well, let alone recognize the British version.;His mother was an actress, who played Juliet on stage.   Poe as a child watched his mother die on stage every single night.Yes, he had a morbid fascination with death.   I believe there was even more to his story, but it&apos;s been a long time since I heard that lecture.;There is a Star Trek: Voyager episode that played with that theme and compounds it with an attempt to turn one of the crew into a soldier for the humanoid bad aliens.There&apos;s also a Twilight Zone episode of a woman waking up from a horrible accident in which her face was awfully &quot;disfigured.&quot;;</string>

            <string>I&apos;m a little overwhelmed by the amount of reading and time involved in trying to keep up with all of the different discussion groups/forums, Maybe this venue will help to crystallize ideas and questions in a less crowded space. :-);My native language is Spanish, reading books in English I find it a challenge to beat, since high school I&apos;ve had problems with English. I love fantastic literature, from ghost stories, extraordinary situation  in ordinary places or hyper realistic. I am concerned about the level of English needed for testing. Hope is an opportunity to show me that if I focus I can make learning more English.;</string>
            <string>Just got back from my exam. Also missed it. Urgh :(;Well I&apos;m not a native English speaker and the main reason I&apos;m taking this course is because I would like to improve my speaking and writing skills, as they are rather poor. I think it should be marked down, because grading me highly wouldn&apos;t help me at all. But ofcourse you may not forget to mention why you gave such a low mark :);</string>
            <string>Nog een Belg! :);Well, I&apos;m actually not happy with the essay I submitted.

            <string>I was enrolled to the previous session of this course which I really loved, but after four weeks there were circumstances in my life that didn&apos;t allow me to continue.Now I am ready to continue, and the question is, what am I supposed to do with first four essays which I already did in previous session.If I write them anew, that wouldn&apos;t be honest, since I watched the lectures already and know more than I supposed to know when I write them.But if I submit the same essays which I wrote before, wouldn&apos;t that be a kind of a &quot;self-plagiarism&quot; and as well dishonest?What should I do?;FYI: Most of the Project Gutenburg books can be found on the Kindle store for free.

            <string>Thank you!! I&apos;ll see you there :);I have noticed that many people are having a hard time with the actual editions they have found to read, be it on a kindle, a computer, or a phone. I, too, struggled with the formats I was finding and downloaded several different versions before I found the one I am now using to read. If I can figure out how to provide the link correctly I think that this copy of the complete book, as published, and with illustrations may help some of you to be able to read the stories more clearly and easily.

It deals with the differences in adult vs, child versions of the stories and how they developed over time. Or as mush as I could fit in exactly 320 words. I also had to do some creative editing in the sources section because they limit you to 100 words, Hard to do when citing works with really long titles.

            <string>How do you know that? There is one of mine that I really don&apos;t want to have to do. I thought they gave us all 5 so we could pick 4.It says 4 required peer reviews, but then on the peer review page it says 5 of 5 required reviews. There is some language in here that indicates that we can choose which essays to review.Very confusing;I still haven&apos;t been able to determine if we are required to do 4 or 5 peer responses.

If there is another one I will repost there, but in case there is not I&apos;m going to go ahead and put mine here and see what happens :-)I am having a much harder time accepting (or even understanding) some of these evaluations. Hopefully I can get some more feedback from all of you...The plot in Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There is  framed around a mostly correctly played game of chess, as noted by  Carroll himself in the Preface of the 1896 edition, that is used as a  road map for Alice to follow.   Alice first sees her chess board to be  played as she and the Red Queen reach the top of the hill.   Alice, while  looking out at the countryside declares,    It   s marked out just like a  large chessboard.    (p.30) I would posit that the game of chess played  out and the trials and tribulations Alice encounters along the way are a  barely veiled metaphor for life   s very real road blocks and adventures. Alice begins the game as a pawn, or a child, with very little power  and only one direction to start to travel.   As Alice journeys forward,  towards ultimately being castled and becoming a Queen, or an adult, we  see her meeting challenges along the way as she encounters and interacts  with the other chess pieces.   She becomes stronger in voicing her own  opinions and ideas as she travels along, growing up in the process.   As  an example, near the end of her journey, while the Queens (Red and White  together) are trying in a sense to put Alice down she exerts her  growing independence.       Can you do sums?    Alice said, turning suddenly  on the White Queen, for she didn   t like being found fault with so much.     (p. 119) As she completes her journey, one can   t help but draw comparisons  with Harry Potter   s journey, as he too must cross a chessboard while  playing Wizard   s Chess on his way towards finding the Sorcerer   s Stone.    There are many other works of literature which draw on the use of this  chess metaphor, as can be seen in the article    Literature and chess   ,  but few bring the joy we share with Alice as she grows along the way.

However, try working on your sentence structure more.peer 2      I apologize if my translation is not understood or knew not understand  aspects of the trial can not read English language correctlypeer 3     Good job!;HI Stephanie -- I really really enjoyed your essay. I&apos;m guessing you have physics as a focus in your real life as well :-).After reading your essay, the first thing I was thinking was, &quot;of course the Cheshire cat and Schroedinger&apos;s cat have parallels. Why didn&apos;t I think of that!) It is nice to see some new ideas and themes, as I said somewhere else, because most of us ended up writing variations on the same or similar themes in one way or another.I think you could have done without including the concept of Quantum indeterminacy at all, as you had no space to comment on it except in including it, and your thesis was well enough supported with your discussion of chaos theory and Schroedinger.There are a few small grammatical errors - there [are] underlying causal models -- for example,Overall, a great job!;Thank you Florencia!I see what you mean about the Harry Potter comparison. I used it as an example of the way the chessboard metaphor is used in other literature. I probably should have either given two examples or none, and just relied on the reference to the article about all the other literature. I think I probably would have done better to do something on your rules idea and less on the metaphor idea.I forgot about the Italics option. In my actual exercise, book titles were underlined correctly with the article titles in quotation marks, but the underlining didn&apos;t transfer when i copied it to this forum. I&apos;ll make sure to correct that when we do this for book number 3.The red queen explains   to Alice the way to become a queen as a parent would instruct a child. Children grow and challenge their authority figures as Alice starts to stand on her own and challenge the Queens.dIt is sooooo hard to decide what to keep and what to leave out   in these short essays. I would much rather write longer pieces but I guess that would put too much pressure on us all as reviewers, reading 5 longer papers.   Maybe one of these times I will be lucky enough to have you as one of my five scoring reviewers :-);Hi Samantha --Thank you for taking the time to review my essay.I really like that you focused in on one specific item -- the mock turtle -- and through exploration of this specific section managed to define an important aspect of the entire book.   So many of us have discussed the books as a whole or broad themes. Your insights are universal, within the context of Alice&apos;s &quot;universe&quot;.As to form issues I won&apos;t get picky. You know what the mistakes are and I know they are almost all typing and/or copying   issues from paper to computer, I like your use of parentheticals, but that is probably because I tend to like to use them as well. For the direct quotes you should identify the location in the book by listing the page number within the body of the text. Overall, your essay was very well constructed and very interesting with well supported arguments. I think I would have probably given you a 2 for form and a 3 for content.Keep up the good work.;Hi Florencia -- Glad to see you here.I&apos;m sure we will all benefit from your insight and generosity again.I agree with one of your other reviewers that you could have rephrased your thesis so as to avoid &quot;my thesis is&quot;. Maybe something like, &quot;While our normal standards of space and time don&apos;t apply in Alice&apos;s lands, they are still not arbitrary.&quot;   This sentence -- Both are cases of enlargement, and Alice learns on the way -- is unclear to me. I think maybe if you put the two separate thoughts into two different sentences you could explain it better. I also feel that your concluding sentence could be more clearly stated. I really like   your essay.   Your thesis is strong and you do a good job of supporting it throughout with appropriate examples and quotations. I think perhaps it might have been stronger to focus on one book or the other, as it is very ambitious to try to cover this topic fully for both books giver the word count.   I&apos;m not sure though. Great job overall!;</string>
            <string>I thought I would go ahead and start this thread for additional peer review of our Dracula essays.   I&apos;ll start it off. Your comments and criticism are most welcome. Stoker uses the mechanism of the epistolary novel not only to give us  the benefits of seeing the unfolding events through the eyes of each of  the protagonists, but also to show us the irony of the fact that this  set of characters seem to be aware of the benefits of pooling their  thoughts and histories themselves, while they are within the story. They  are aware of the benefits of both having and learning from this record,  thus being able to use this knowledge as they progress. This can be viewed as the Victorian version of 20/20 hindsight as  Harker relates near the end, in his 3 October journal entry.      We have  been blind somewhat. Blind after the manner of men, since we can look  back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able  to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is  it not?    (p. 450) It seems from the very beginning that the characters are aware that  their story is being written both for them to use and for us to read, as  Harker first starts keeping his diary on page 3. As the most prodigious  of the diarists Stoker presents Jonathon and Mina as the arbiters of  truth, not only in their writings, but especially Mina as custodian of  their written records as, also in his 3 October entry, Jonathon tells  her that    she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers  or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was to keep the  record.    (p. 418) Jonathon acknowledges, still on the 3rd, that he    must not  stop to think. All big and little must go down.   Perhaps at the end,  the little things teach us most.    (p. 413) And earlier that their    work  is to be a    sealed book,    (p.363) which we are lucky enough to share  with them through Stocker   s machinations.;Thank you Kasey --All six! of my reviewers were very critical this time and I got my lowest score yet. That&apos;s part of why I wanted to get additional opinions on it. I&apos;m going to read your essay now. Stand by for comments. :-);Hi Florencia --Glad to see you here. What a small Coursera world. Aren&apos;t there 20,000 or so people taking this course? I&apos;ll have to look and see if I can figure out which one you are. I&apos;m guessing 1 of the only 2 that wrote anything constructive and not just critical. Now, If I&apos;ve figured this out right either 2 or 3   of my reviewers gave me 1&apos;s for content. It&apos;s a little frustrating. I know it&apos;s not my best effort but I was expecting the middle of the road 4 overall. I know what 1 essays look like because I&apos;ve had to give a few. This is not a 1 essay! Unfortunately there is nothing to be done about it except move on and hope the rest go better. I&apos;m behind on my reading so I don&apos;t know how my Frankenstein essay will come out. I actually haven&apos;t started reading it yet so I had better get to that. It looks like Celine gave you some good feedback so if you don&apos;t mind too much I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll get to yours till tomorrow.;I think you were my peer 6. Did you wish I had expanded on the concept of Jonathan and Mina as the arbiters of truth?;Hi Florencia -- Yes - you were my peer 1.   I continue to respect you for the quality of your reviews, but even more for your generosity in continuing to review so many essays in order to help your peers. You devote many, many hours to us and I want to make sure that you know how much you are appreciated.;Kasey --How picky do you want me to be?? At first reading I really liked your essay a lot. Then I did what I usually do and printed out a copy to mark things on. (I still write to paper and then transpose to the computer, I can&apos;t write to keyboard except for forum type entries.) I can either give you a few general comments or I can get really specific. Which would you like me to do?;Kasey --I&apos;m going to be tougher than I would be if you were one of my 5.   That way you can have the most possible information for next time....As I said, on first reading I really liked your essay a lot. It was an interesting subject and you write very well. I always do a word count check as I get ready to print out a copy and found that your essay came in at 347 words. After all the discussion on these forums about word limits this could have been an issue with some of your reviewers. After printing it out to really study it, in order to be able to give you the most feedback that I could, this is what I found. You have a very strong well worded thesis and you back it up well with appropriate examples and quotations. I would add &quot;the&quot; to make it &quot;the old ways of superstition&quot; to keep the same format as &quot;the new modern&quot;. Your concluding sentence is just sort of hanging out there and you should probably integrate it into the body of your last paragraph. You could probably easily have pared the word count down to the limit by eliminating duplications and rewording some things. The second sentence of your thesis statement is, &quot;Through the character of Van Helsing, we see Stoker&apos;s claim that science alone is not enough, but that both science and superstition are needed for success.&quot;   The very next sentence says, &quot;Van Helsing uses science to prolong life and aid the characters in finding Dracula, but this science is not enough.&quot;   The last sentence of the second paragraph. &quot;...science...alone cannot do the job.&quot;   First sentence third paragraph, &quot;he knows that they need something more powerful than just science.&quot; Last sentence third paragrah, &quot;...science...will not be enough...&quot; Last paragraph   uses &quot;in the end&quot; twice, and there is one misspelling of Dracula. Last sentence third paragraph: I always offset &quot;in fact&quot; with commas on each end. Back to the first paragraph you have, &quot;Through the character of, Van Helsing,&quot; then, &quot;Van Helsing uses, &quot;Van Helsing represents,&quot; and &quot;Van Helsing uses.&quot; By the end of the essay, and considering your concluding statement, the reader could be wondering if your essay is not more about Van Helsing than the &quot;science vs. superstition&quot; thesis, so you should probably find a quote or example of your thesis that doesn&apos;t use Van Helsing and/or reword your conclusion.That&apos;s all I have. Let me know what you think.Laurie;Just to add to the confusion --   I&apos;m working off of   &quot;A New Edition&quot;   1823   With one &quot;Preface.;My &quot;grades&quot; are also getting lower.

I think I probably spend at least half an hour on each review. In one of the places it says when you have at least 4 out of 5....I wish these forums were staff monitored like my other course. I feel as though there is no one out there to help us. It&apos;s frustrating to have questions that you know will never be answered. (sigh);I&apos;ll go first again. I hope you&apos;re out there Florencia - you know when I wrote this, so what do you think....The very human need for companionship in general and close companionship specifically is a major theme throughout Frankenstein.    Whether it be the fellowship of man in broad terms or a close paired  relationship, either with friend or spouse, nearly all the characters  are either seeking its bonds or running from them through self-imposed  isolation. Frankenstein exemplifies all of the aspects of the full spectrum of  human relationships throughout the book even, ironically, the two  extremes simultaneously.   The monster, while always seeking acceptance  and companionship can also, in essence, be seen as a metaphor for  mankind   s perpetual search for fellowship. His search, therefore, is chimeric, as a thing that is hoped or  wished for but is in fact illusory or impossible to achieve.   At the  same time the monster himself is a chimera in other ways.   He is a  creature with parts taken from many others, thereby containing a mixture  of genetically different tissues; the very thing that is the basis of  so much hatred and discord in volatile political climates, as people  desire the society of their peers. In this sense, with the monster viewed as the    everyman   , the book,  beyond its straightforward depiction of the relationships between its  characters, can be seen as a treatise on the nature of the overall  political climate of the time, and man   s overall tendency to  marginalize, stereotype or shun those seeking autonomy and acceptance. At the end of the book Frankenstein dies while experiencing the  duality of states he has exemplified throughout, with his new friendship  with Walton while perpetually isolated from the fellowship of man in  general. The monster, however, remains    forever ardent and craving;  [still desiring] love and fellowship,    (Vol II, p.275) without the  possibility of obtaining any of    the various relationships which bind  one human being to another in mutual bonds.    (Vol II, p.14);Florencia -- How strange that you should actually get two of my essays to score! There must have already been huge attrition in this class. I wonder how many of the initial students are still here with us. We started with something like 27,000 or something, didn&apos;t we?Thank you so much for your review. You were my peer 3.   It was insightful and helpful as always. And especially thank you for saying it was one of the best Frankenstein essays you had read. That means a lot. Thank you for the 3, but I must have gotten 1s again from some of my peers because I ended up with 2s (total score 4). Would you believe one of them marked me down because there was space at the top of the essay, then said I spelled &quot;its&quot; wrong and that it should be &quot;it&apos;s&quot;. Hard to deal with people &quot;correcting&quot; your already correct usage... (sigh) And then I get comments like this, &quot;maybe add some examples and do a better job at having a more persuasive argument and essay.&quot;I think Jeremy did an excellent job at reviewing your essay. Do you still want more feedback?;Hi Florencia --Overall I think peer 2 and Jeremy did an excellent job and between the two of them covered many of the points I would have, so just a few here.Your writing in this essay has some of the same weaknesses that mine tends to have. I sometimes rely too heavily on the use of parentheticals and quotation marks to offset specific words or concepts and/or asides when using a more conversational tone as you do here. For me, the overall essay did not seem to flow easily and I had to go back and reread carefully to keep track of which usage you were using where. Having said that it may just be the nature of the beast in discussing forms of word usage. At the beginning you do one of the big things I used to do all the time and get corrected for. Writing in the passive tense is discouraged in academic writing. As such, &quot;This is said by the monster,&quot; should probably read, &quot;The monster says.&quot; In the last sentence of the second paragraph &quot;common core&quot; might better be &quot;common root&quot; and there is a rare, for you, usage error.   &quot;This can be thought as,&quot; should be, &quot;this can be thought of as.&quot;I agree with Jeremy that, &quot;Up to the first half,&quot; should be changed, I just disagree on how. I would use either,&quot;During the first half,&quot; or, &quot;Throughout the first half.&quot; Clearly, you know that, &quot;he&apos;s is not merry,&quot; needs to be he&apos;s or he is.Hope this helps. Sorry I am so late in getting to it.;Of course it is passive tense. Thank you for the correction.Do you know if there is a way on here to have a private conversation?

I will post mine when I finish with this..I don&apos;t have much to say this time about content. Yours is different from mine but well thought out and presented.   I did, however, like your peers, find many word usage, grammatical, and spelling mistakes which is very unusual for you.I&apos;m not sure that I would classify the female characters as protagonists as they are so passive. I would have used the word characters, which would also then be in contrast to them becoming active through their loss.the responsible ---&gt; the one responsiblewomen rivals with ---&gt; women are rivals oflooses ---&gt; loseAylmer considers her wife ---&gt; his wifetrasforms ---&gt; transformssufficent ---&gt; sufficientsustraction ---&gt; subtraction   2XThat&apos;s all I really have this time.

This could help to improve the English of some of the students that do not speak english as their native/first language (like me).Hopefully we can improve our writting in English together, especially for the next assignment.

            <string>I think that part of the repetition can be due to the fact that these stories started out as part of an oral tradition. These stories were told to young children and made easy to remember so that they could pass on the history. Perhaps the repetition was so that they could remember it longer and retell it simply or maybe that at the time they heard it they only remembered the hero doing an action three times and didn&apos;t remember the details in between, leading to the seemingly redundant repetition of actions and phrases. I personally found the repeating of action in the stories distracting. I felt it halted the continuation of plot in favor of lengthening the stories. Any other reactions?;</string>

            <string>If you could record your essay, I&apos;m sure everyone would love it **sigh**;No, I thought Victor was a whinny egotistical jerk.  ;I read the Hobbit when I was 11. Soon followed by Madeline L&apos;Engle. There was a young adult series written in the 60&apos;s called &quot;the City of Gold and Lead&quot;. By the time I was in high school, I had read most of the classics and all the science fiction and fantasy that was in my local public library. I don&apos;t read as much of it as I used to, every once in a while a new author pops up like Robin Hobbs or Michael Sullivan that entices me back to the genre.;I got an essay about &quot;the Pit and the Pendulum&quot;.  ;I found that it made a difference which browser I used and the media viewer I was using. Chrome on my pc doesn&apos;t load the videos at all, but it works fine on my tablet. Firefox works for both.;</string>

            <string>Thanks, Nicole! That&apos;s very helpful!;</string>
            <string>Wow this is great thank you soo much!;Check this one:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068  I&apos;ve downloaded from here, it worked perfectly for me, I could even see the illustrations.;Most Grimm Brother&apos;s stories were taken from the leyends and stories people told. Most of them have the evil winin order to teach lessons to the little kids (for example, in the original little red ridding hood, the wolf eats little red riding hood and no one saves her, they also eat the girl&apos;s granma togueter, without her knowing,of course. This was so kids would not talk to strangers and would not go out of the way when heading somewhere).  About the inconsistency, remember is a set of stores and each story has a different &quot;universe&quot;, and not all of them are the same.  Abput the sexist and classist, remember that back in those days they lived like that, it was not until many many years later that women took an important place in society, and I am pretty sure we still have, sadly, some problems with classes in many places. The heroine has those traits to teach girls how they were supposed to be, they were like an example set for them, so that good thing would happen to them too. Stories were, indeed, a kind of implicit treath to their kids to be good, many of the versions &quot;accepted&quot; nowadays are adapted for being less crude(like eating granma e.e)I apologize if my answer bothers you, it is not my point, I just could not say a word for some of my favorites. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, I am just excusing my poor old fairytales, they are not quite up to date!;</string>
            <string>Terrific analysis! Will this be the basis for your essay?;That&apos;s an interesting idea, if you mean that his companions embody the &quot;Alice&quot; role with the Doctor as the Cheshire Cat/Caterpillar role? I can see some parallels in that case. Do you have any specific scenarios that you see between the series and the books? Of the companions, I see Rose as the most Alice-like due to her character&apos;s youth, naivete, and bewilderment at the adventures that she and the Doctor got into.  ;I had the same problem as the OP and kept staring at the blank screen! When I finally typed in my last word and checked the word count, it said 388! What?! Writing TOO much is like never a problem for me. But I&apos;ll take your advice and imagine that I&apos;m talking to a friend about what I want to talk about in regards to the book.  ;Yes! My thoughts exactly! It seems like there is very little time to actually read the works due to having to write and review the papers. The kindle does not seem like an easy way to read the books, to be honest. I&apos;ve had mine for a year and a half and I still don&apos;t know how to find a book by its title and then go to the front page, rather than the highlighted keywords. I personally got the physical book for most of the texts that we&apos;re supposed to read in addition to an e-version.  However, I hope you don&apos;t quit this class! If anything, just read the books and follow along the forum for discussions. I might end up doing that, rather than trying to keep up with all the assignments. When I signed up for the class, I was hoping for something exactly like the discussion forums where we exchange ideas and the like, not the written assignments that we ended up getting.  ;</string>

            <string>I love the show Once Upon a Time.   My favorite character is Mr. Gold/  Rumpelstiltskin.   I haven&apos;t watched much of the last season, but do enjoy seeing their spin on the fairy tale characters.;Carol,I do plan on reading them.   I want to read book 1 before I go back and watch Season 1 again.    :);</string>
            <string>The same happened to me;I found what you said about cloth  very interesting,  because I thought the same about food and beauty: it seems like these are recurring in the the stories, but I hadn&apos;t noticed the cloth. Thank you for pointing that out and relating it with Fate, it feels spot on.;Thank you all who are posting here. I just thought that I&apos;d focus on one tale only, so here it is:The Gallant Tailor seems to deal mostly with self-awareness and how it affects the way other characters see the protagonist.In the beginning, when he kills seven flies and decides to tell the whole town what he did, he does say that he thinks that that is quite a feat, and throughout the story he does not seem to think of himself as a cheat or someone who says half-truths, even when he lies to a giant to his own advantage or tricks two of them into a fight to the death.  When facing adversities or challenges he manages to surpass them, which leads him to he make a name for himself and end up as king.He is both lucky and witty, and although the title says &quot;gallant&quot;, his actions show how he takes advantage of the situations he sees himself into, and how his luck and wits make him see himself as gallant and how other people see himself as such, even though he is presented to the reader under a different light.;Thanks for your comment!I have this bad habit of scratching the surface and leaving... Well, thanks!;It all seem sound, the way you linked the motifs to the characters makes a lot of sense, from my point of view.  The idea of a the rabbit being sad by the loss of a loved one, especially because he thought he had killed her feels like an attempt to deal with death. Like you said, a non-threatening way to show a harsh reality. At first I thought that the use of a figure made of straw could have something to do with her marrying unwillingly and becoming a shadow of her former self, out of sadness caused by her &quot;imprisonment&quot;. Perhaps that (her sadness) has something with her causa mortis? If I am reading correctly, I can only say well done!;</string>
            <string>Hey! Interesting question!I always prefer reading a book/play in the original language (if I can).Reading in English comes more naturally, even though my native languages are Dutch and French.However, I&apos;ve been reading more and more translations of books I really love (and practically know by heart) in order to make connections and see how those works got translated. This is super interesting!;Hi Lucy, my mother language is Brazilian Portuguese.The version I mentioned I&apos;m not sure to be suggested for the course, if I find the notice group.;</string>
            <string>Hoi! Ik kom van Belgi  ! Dus ik ben niet Nederlands, maar telt dit ook? :) Veel leesplezier!  ;I absolutely agree with you: books for children and young adults are often very well written and van be so interesting in terms of ideology!  (Favourite authors here: John Green, Anne Provoost, Philip Pullman.....);I&apos;ve been wanting to start reading Pratchett for a long time but i just don&apos;t know where to start.. any suggestions for my first Pratchett book?  ;oooh! man! I never thought about connections between Doctor Who and Alice! This is fascinating!  And so great to see that Whovians are pretty much everywhere. :p yay!  ;Identity is a very interesting theme to discuss with respect to Alice. So much has been written about it though, don&apos;t know if you&apos;ll be able to come up with a lot of new insights in the matter.  ;Hey- I bought the Penguin Classics edition years ago and I love this version! It has an interesting introduction and notes at the end of the stories. It also includes the manuscript version of Alice&apos;s Adventures Under Ground and Carroll&apos;s essay &apos;Alice on the Stage&apos;. I highly recommend it!;</string>
            <string>I read in English, my native language is Brazilian Portuguese.;</string>
            <string>I think that both men and women are portrayed in a simplistic and dualistic way. If fact, after watching all the videos for Unit 1 yesterday, I think women actually got some benefits they do not deserve in these tales. For example, in The Frog Prince the princess is actually a mean, disloyal woman who, at the end, gets a handsome prince and a happy ending. Some of the women in the tales do nothing to deserve the good things that come to them but they actually get away with having a good life. I also think that men are stereotipical some times, and they get good and bad outcomes. I would even dare to say that men seem less central in these stories that women actually are. Which is surprising if we consider the times when they were collected and the further times when they were passed along orally.;</string>

            <string>In Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll constantly questions the limits between reality and fiction. This is achieved through different literary mechanisms. There is the use of metafiction, mise en abyme, and self reference. Metafiction, according to Patricia Waugh is:    fictional writing which self-consciously and systematically draws attention to its status as an artifact in order to pose questions about the relationship between fiction and reality    (2). The first example of metafiction that we encounter is right at the beginning of the story:    and what is the use of a book without pictures of conversation?    (8). This first allusion about the act of literary creation within a literary creation can be seen as a hint to the reader of what Carroll will deliver in this book: plenty of conversation and pictures. In terms of the mise en abyme, it could be argued that Alice has fallen asleep at the beginning of the story:    for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid    (0) and that, within her dreams; she has created a whole new world which is a reflection of her own. As any mirror image, this one shows backward or altered images of the    real    world and we can find, within this self-reflected universe, several more.   Finally, Alice shows an explicit example of self reference when she says:    When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I   ll write one- but I am grown up now.    (50) These three literary devices serve Carroll to explore the limits and scope of the fictional world and to reflect on the role of the author, the reader and literature. GRADES Your grade is 4.5, which is simply the grade you received from your peers. See below for details. peer 1     Very well written, very good grammar and vocabulary. peer 2     Very well written! peer 3     Excellent grammar, language and structure. The essay is clear and to the point, and the writer&apos;s conclusion both references the initial argument and gives it added depth. The writer has a strong ability to convey their argument through the chosen references. peer 4     I think you are the first student in here to correctly quote and make references. Also, in general, all of your essay&apos;s structure is clear and flows very nicely. Overall: 2.5 peer 1     The thesis is very clear, the arguments with supporting examples are polished, and the conclusion is very logical. Well done, and interesting insights. peer 2     I liked your paragraph very much. I&apos;m very tempted to give you a 3, but I had to google &quot;mise en abyme&quot; for more definition so I will give you a 2 (I know, why should you lose the point because of my ignorance! I guess because of the audience-and-purpose thing, I can&apos;t be confident that everyone in our class would know what mise en abyme is before reading your paragraph). Having said that, your content was almost 3-worthy and I really, really enjoyed reading it. It has definitely enriched my understanding of the work. Well done! peer 3     The writer&apos;s thesis as to the construction of Lewis Carroll&apos;s works is very precise, and examines the books from their literary structure. I think that the argument is very persuasive, if somewhat too scholarly. That really is not a criticism, but a personal reflection. I think the writer has an excellent grasp of literary criticism overall. peer 4     It was nice to find an analysis not focused on the plot per se, but on the narrative structure and literary devices. Very interesting, keep it up. Overall: 2 ;</string>

            <string>In a way, yes - the bible makes use of many literaty tools, including repetition. But the sacredness of the number 3 or the literaty tool of repetition must be much older than the bible and does not stem from this.  ;I think that it might also have the very simple function of making the story slightly longer. If the story was about a person that went into the world, met an obstacle, conquered it and returned home, there would not be much entertainment. By having three (or more) obstacles, or sometimes three sons/daughters where the first two fail the first obstacle and the third makes it by overcoming three obstacles, we have a story that is of a useful length; short enough to be told at bedtime or over a jug of beer, but not so long as to bore the audience or make the storyteller get confused (indeed, it is also easier to remember a story when you have three similar points along the storyline).  This is of course not the only or entire explanation, but it might be part of why there are three obstacles in many fairy tales.;A major difference between Andersen&apos;s stories and Grimm&apos;s is the degree of details. As Andersen&apos;s stories are his own - inspired by the tradition of fairy tales of course, but created by his fantasy - you will find that they in much greater detail describes the looks and feels of the items in the stories. He takes great care to arrange the setting, whereas the fairy tales can take place almost anywhere in the world.Take as an example the introduction to Aschenputtel:&quot;There was once a rich man whose wife lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter to come near her bed, and said,  &quot;Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you.&quot;  And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother&apos;s grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife.&quot;And the introduction to The Little Match Girl:&quot;It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark. Evening came on, the last evening of the year. In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she&apos;d had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she&apos;d not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.&quot;The details are so much more important in Andersen&apos;s stories, as they are his exact words and probably written and re-written many times until *he* was content, while the details - save from a few magic phrases or adjectives that are important for the story later on - are not that important in fairy tales and have probably been changed a million times over the years, with all the different storytellers, until the brothers Grimm wrote them down - and they don&apos;t seem to have been all to careful with the wording, as long as the point was made.  One other issue here - for I need to get back to my essay and not spend my Monday evening writing about Andersen - is the unimportant details, Andersen brings into the story. E.g. &quot;One slipper she&apos;d not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own.&quot; - this comment from the boy is in no way important, we have already learned that the slippers were big, event way too big, and also that they had been her mother&apos;s. But Andersen wants us to really feel with this girl, so he overloads us with details about the mocking. Fairy tales rarely contain anything that is not important to the storyline.;Sorry, forgot to add:  Aschenputtel is quoted from the Lucy Crane edition, The Little Match Girl quotation is Hersholt&apos;s translation, which is a very good translation (http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheLittleMatchGirl_e.html).;I grew up with these fairy tales and it was nice to meet some of the characters again - Mother Hulda, oh I had completely forgotten about her, and I recalled the images of my childhood fairy tale books. Note to self: Must find these books at my mother&apos;s house and have my own kids read them :)As for the two-dimensional characters, I think that it is very important in folk tales and fairy tales to have basic characters with basic stereotypical features - greedy, proud, wise, dumb, beautiful - as it makes it so easy to transfer the stories from one part of the world to another. These stories are quite universal and have been around &quot;forever&quot;, which might have been difficult if the characters were complex. Also, it makes it easier for the storyteller to tell almost the same story each time as he does not have to dwell on or remember details about the characters, places, etc. - just the basic outline of the story. Something happened to someone, he did this, this happened, he did that, then this happened and he won. It also makes the stories perfect to tell over supper, before putting the kids to bed, between songs around the fire in the evening etc.;It is always an hour after the submission deadline, just as we get the results an hour after the peer review submission deadline - so in a few minutes :);On the Home screen to the right there is an Upcoming Deadlines section with the Assignment link. If you click this link you can also see a countdown to the deadline so that you will not be in doubt if it is noon or midnight (for us 24-hour clock people it is not always easy to figure out).;The menu entry Peer Responses also contain a link to the Assignment form, if it is not overdue. Not very logical ;).;Make sure that you have the correct timezone in Settings, then you can see the countdown to the deadlines in Home =&gt; Upcoming Deadlines Assignments - &lt;click the link to the assignment&gt; - the Peer Assessment page (e.g. &quot;due in 1day 22h&quot; is written for me now as it is the time left to grade the other essays). Hope this helps!;It is my understanding that it is at least 4, but 5 if you are up for it. I guess that the remaining essays will be graded by staff in the hour between our submission of the peer reviews and the release of our grades...  ;</string>

            <string>this is a link to a really useful software that allows you to get e books in mobi, or epub format into your ipad or tablet, for ibooks or the kindle app, it also converts from different formats and it is free coded so you can work on it yourself.  http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windowsProject gutenberd is an interesting initiative to preserve literature for future generations, check it out, you may find good reads here.http://www.gutenberg.org/;I haven&apos;t finished the entire book yet, but my favorite so far has to be The Mouse, The Bird, and The Sausage. I laughed outloud at a cooking sausage that placed him (her?)self in the pot to spice the soup. I loved the idea that the three were very content living as they did until an outsider made a comment that made the bird think he was unhappy and that was the entire groups undoing. Also, having never read these before, I just had to comment that when I was reading Rapunzel, I honestly was shocked that they very clearly told us how Rapunzel had never seen a man before, and then, once Gothel put her out of the tower, she gave birth to twins. HMMMM... LOL;</string>
            <string>Hi all. I am from Calcutta, and was wondering how we plan to make the study group work. I am taking two other courses right now, but I really want to ensure I complete this one. I audited this course the last time around, so thankfully I have read almost all the works.  Oh and by the way of introduction, I am presently happily jobless (for two more month, ah!). I am a BA in English Literature from Presidency College, Calcutta and am scheduled *touch-wood* to pursue my M.Phil from Trinity College Dublin (Popular Literature). In the interim period of four years, I worked as a Technical Writer and Content Writer in Cognizant and PwC. Nice to meet all of you.  ;As I am writing the first &apos;essay&apos;, I have a feeling that I am not writing the essay but a note. I wonder what makes an essay and a note.;</string>

            <string>I downloaded in Kindle-friendly formatting (.mobi) from Gutenberg Press, too, and it includes the woodcut-style illustrations. Rather beautiful.Actually, I downloaded most of the books from there.;</string>
            <string>That&apos;s why I began to read way in advance. Now that we&apos;re just starting the course, I&apos;m about to finish my fourth reading (actually skipped Frankenstein because I didn&apos;t want to read it right after Dracula). And I have the same question for Poe. Is there a selection to read? The Portable Poe is really huge and somehow I&apos;m not enjoying the stories.;</string>
            <string>Hi all,For me, the syllabus is quite clear about the readings. The only unit I had a question about is the Grimm&apos;s tales, but that has been satisfactorily answered (i.e. read the entire text)  . I think what threw me off was the description &quot;the specific stories are&quot;, yet I believe this means that there are many more Grimm&apos;s tales than are in that one translation, so by using this translation we are doing selected readings. For the rest of the syllabus Prof. Rabkin explicitly states what stories we are to read.   For example:&quot;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne&apos;s &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment,&quot; and &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;; Poe&apos;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Oval Portrait,&quot; &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee.&quot; All the readings except Ray Bradbury&apos;s  The Martian Chronicles  and Ursula K. LeGuin&apos;s  The Left Hand of Darkness  will be available online at no charge.&quot;Click on the link above to view the entire syllabus for more details.;</string>
            <string>I will say, I was extremely frustrated to wait until today for the class to start and then have to wait again. I viewed the preleased videos and read the first assignment - only to find that now I have to sit around and wait until Thursday to actually see a course video. VERY frustrating. I actually did not like the Grimm tales at all for the most part and was hoping that I&apos;d obtain some thoughtful insight to help me appreciate them a bit more.;It&apos;s such an awesome series. I love the universe  Buckingham created and the personalities he injected into the  characters.  ;</string>
            <string>This is very interesting! I think your post is a perfect example of Prof. Rabkin&apos;s directive to &quot;enrich the reading...&quot; I certainly wouldn&apos;t have connected these tales with Covey or management training on my own, but I&apos;m certain to be seeking those connections now. Thank you for sharing such a fun and thought-provoking new perspective! I also think your comment about the structural function of this asking/compliance will help alleviate some of the frustration and downright annoyance I&apos;ve felt while reading many of these stories. I don&apos;t have a lot of background in literature study, which I&apos;m sure interferes with my ability to approach these tales from a deeper understanding, so I&apos;m often left with the feeling that I&apos;m both missing the &quot;real&quot; meaning and that I just plain didn&apos;t enjoy the stories/characters. So many of the less familiar tales especially seem disjointed, although when I was looking back to find an example to use here, I found I was less irritated than on my initial readings (&quot;Death of Hen&quot;, &quot;The Mouse, Bird, and Sausage&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Korbes&quot;) so maybe I just need repeated readings and a new frame of reference like you&apos;ve offered here. Thanks again!;Wonderful birthday serendipity! I too will be requesting the book. Thanks also for sharing the NYTimes link which at first glance looks very interesting. Now if I can just show some restraint and focus and save it to read for after my essay is done :)  ;Oh, Marla, you are a bad influence for someone who&apos;s worried about keeping up with assigned work :) Really though, thanks for sharing! They sound great.;</string>

            <string>Here&apos;s an interesting review of a new vampire movie.  ;</string>
            <string>If anybody is interested in free audiobooks, you can find in this website all the classic books which are in the public domain:http://librivox.org/The books from Carrol, Stoker, Shelly are there, and probably some more that I have not checked yet. It&apos;s not the best way to &apos;read&apos; a book, but it&apos;s enjoyable in its own way :);</string>
            <string>White and red plays a role in &quot;The Twelve Brothers.&quot; The Queen would raise a white flag if she bore a son whereas a red flag would signify a daughter. It even says &quot;blood red&quot; to describe the flag--and of course, the brothers were supposed to die (hence the blood reference) if a daughter was born. I think, like some others have mentioned, that the idea of blood (red), purity (white), and darkness (black) comes into play. I wonder, though, how black would be perceived in this story. The brothers are turned into ravens, which are black, but then they are once again humans. Thoughts on the colors in this tale?;I was going to mention the reference to the Bible as well, but that has already been stated.   I will say, though, I was surprised that   the Queen was going to sacrifice her children. Was anyone else surprised by this?   A lot of these tales don&apos;t end well for some (or all) of the characters, so the fact that the Queen agreed and everyone was happy about it, indeed surprised me.   In this tale, everyone lived &quot;happily ever after,&quot; which I did not suspect would happen.  ;Very true. In a world where anything is possible, maybe we shouldn&apos;t have been surprised :);I noticed that a lot of the royal characters in these tales don&apos;t have names. They are just referred to a King, Queen, Prince, or Princess. Maybe this is a way of creating the concept of &quot;common royalty&quot; (which seems like an oxymoron), so that readers could relate to the story in that the characters could be rulers of any country, including their country. I could really be going out on a limb with that idea, but I still think there&apos;s something to be said about the nameless characters, royal and otherwise.;Good point!;Whose twins are Rapunzel&apos;s? Is the father the King&apos;s son? Another man? Miraculous conception?  It says that the King&apos;s son wanders for several years and that Rapunzel has given birth to twins, a boy and girl.   It doesn&apos;t say how old they are, so perhaps they are the King&apos;s son&apos;s children.  It may not be significant, but I&apos;m curious as to what other people think.  ;Thanks for the information. I did notice that Rapunzel is referred to as his &quot;wife,&quot; but with the vagueness of the King&apos;s son wandering for &quot;several&quot; years, I wasn&apos;t sure if the children could be his. This now makes me wonder how different the other versions/translations of all of these tales really are.  ;I like the connection you made to Oedipus. I was thinking to myself while reading &quot;Rapunzel&quot; that this is definitely not the Disney version most children are now accustomed to. I, personally, did not remember a version where the male character is blinded by thorns!;My sister is a Disney fanatic (she owns her own Disney travel agency), so I can&apos;t wait to tell her about the versions of these stories that we&apos;re reading, like &quot;Aschenputtel&quot; (Cinderella) too!  ;I was going to basically point out the same thing. The repetition builds suspense because you pretty much know that something climatic will happen on the third time, whatever that may be, good or bad.;Did anyone else think about Hercules when reading &quot;The White Snake&quot;? When the servant had to perform the three tasks, I was trying to think of other stories in which a character had to perform tasks. When he had to retrieve an apple from the tree of life, I was immediately reminded of the story of Hercules in which he was instructed to find a golden apple. Both trees are located at the edge of the earth and both bear golden apples. Can you think of other stories that include this same story line of golden apples?  ;</string>

            <string>So many people have made comments already that I would second. For one, the epistolary format allows for multiple first-person perspectives. I love that about Dracula. Personally, I feel like this is the best format for this novel! I must say, I was excited when the professor mentioned Samuel Richardson&apos;s Pamela as an example since I read that novel years ago. I read that the same semester as Richardson&apos;s Clarissa, a daunting 1,500 pages! Anyone else read either of those?  ;I also like watching the movie after reading a book, so yesterday I looked up the cast of the 1992 movie. Keanu Reeves? Really? That alone makes me not want to watch it (along with Winona Ryder)... though Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins I have high hopes for. We&apos;ll see if I can find a copy of it, and I might give it a shot.   As for other movies and books, I don&apos;t know that I&apos;ve ever come across a movie that was better than the book.  ;</string>
            <string>Thanks for the information!;I just now stumbled onto this post. I, too, noticed a connection between the two works, particularly with Mina&apos;s and Harry&apos;s scars. I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one who noticed it!   And now with Frankenstein, there&apos;s the reference to the philosopher&apos;s stone and the elixir of life. As someone else mentioned, Rowling pulled from so many great works and ideas from the past.;&quot;Learn from me [...] how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.&quot;  I just love this quote!   It didn&apos;t connect with my essay topic, so I had to draw attention to it somehow :)   It&apos;s just impressive to me that Shelley was only 18 when she began writing Frankenstein and came up with a sentiment as intelligently written as this one. I then think of today&apos;s society, and it&apos;s 18-year-olds...;</string>
            <string>No idea Pavel, but watching this thread with interest as I&apos;m in a similar position!;</string>
            <string>If there are any TAs, community or otherwise, their posts are flagged as such.;There is a 10% tolerance on word count (this is also in line with my experience in higher education here in the UK).The question of counting singular possessives as two words but plurals as one results, I would think, from the software simply counting the apostrophe as a word break. If more letters follow then there are two words, if a space follows then there is only one.;Having a word limit is a useful discipline, having a low word count requires clarity of thought and expression. It is far more difficult (for me) to write 300 focused and pertinent words than 3,000 words of meandering stream of consciousness.I&apos;ve not come across any written work in higher education here in the UK that did not have a word limit.;I don&apos;t know what constitutes a note but, for me, an essay (in this context) is the argumentative support of a thesis. It must therefore state, explicitly or implicitly, the thesis, present one or more arguments to support this and have a conclusion to draw together the case. While there are standardised forms for essays (the &apos;five paragraph&apos; frame is common), it is the content rather than the presentation which, in my eyes, is important. An &apos;essay&apos; could, in principle, be contained in a single sentence, while thousands of words could be expended without satisfying the essentials.;I found this very difficult because, although I&apos;ve written a lot over the years (from repeatedly unpublished short stories via political articles ghost written for others through to many technical publications) I&apos;ve no experience of literary criticism or analysis. I was the unfortunate product of an &apos;accelerated studies&apos; project back in the 70s which meant my formal education in English was finished by the time I was 14. This has left me permanently conscious of gaps and weaknesses on my writing.Despite all of that, we can, at least, rest easy under the cloak of anonymity and, to quote the Duke of Wellington out of context, &apos;publish and be damned&apos;!;Just a quick technical point, you say, &quot;I&apos;d just keep an eye on [the word count] since it could become a problem with a more stringent marker?&quot;. As the system won&apos;t accept a submission which is more than 10% over the limit this should not be an issue; if the work is accepted then it must be within the limit!;Yes, I wish this system had been in place on a previous course where word count was a constant source of conflict on the forums. Some refused to accept that writing 4000 words for an essay specified for 700 was anything other than a reflection of their right to self-expression.;Works Cited is the terminology used in the MLA citation system. It is equivalent to the References section in APA or Harvard standards, Any work which is quoted either directly or by paraphrase should be listed in enough detail that the reader can return to that source to verify the accuracy and context of the quotation.Woks Cited is not a general bibliography nor &apos;Works consulted&apos;.;</string>
            <string>I am hoping that when we do our peer reviews, we will be open to the views of othersI completely agree with that although my experience elsewhere is that some are unable to make that separation. I&apos;ve certainly had worked marked down, elsewhere, with the sinlge comment &quot;I completely disagree with this view&quot;.I hope that it is remembered that we are not all Doctoral students,teachers, nor perfect in our English.  Nevertheless we are asked to mark to objective standards, at least in regard to form. A well-argued essay can and should be awarded a 1 for form while gaining a 2 or even 3 for content if it&apos;s presentation doesn&apos;t meet the expectations. The course expects writers to be fluent in English and be able to communicate at a level appropriate to undergraduates.As the Course Syllabus page puts it:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable[my emphasis];To say &apos;a lot of Old English... seems funny(and sometimes not even understandable)&apos; is something of an understatement. Little of Old English is comprehensible to modern English speakers. Take a look at this sample:F _der ure  _u  _e eart on heofonumSi  _in nama gehalgodThose are the first two lines of the Lords Prayer in Old English. It is slightly more comprehensible when spoken but even so is a long way from the language we now know. Shakespeare is generally seen as standing on the threshold between Middle English and Modern English (or more properly, between Early Modern and Modern). We can read Shakespeare today and understand the language despite a few changes in vocabulary. Writing a scant hundred years earlier is far less comprehensible and in the period of Old English (some five hundred or more years before Shakespeare&apos;s time) we are back to just the occasional wisps of meaning breaking through to our modern ears.;What do you feel is stopping you from reflecting on your work and the comments you receive?I reflect on every piece of work I undertaken whether it is a piece of writing, a lesson taught or an engineering project I have completed. I would have assumed this was the case for everyone until I became a teacher when I found to my chagrin that my students had no interest in feedback beyond the grade awarded.;As has been said, the system should not accept submissions more than 10% over the word limit. If I had received such long essays I would have marked 1 on form and only considered the first 350 words for content. The most generous of my former seats of education would automatically apply a 10% penalty, the harshest, disallow the entire work.;I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m taking those figures as overall guidance rather than hard and fast rules in each assessment. To apply strict proportionality in a set of five assessments simply leads to inaccurate assessment. It would be quite possible to draw a set of five essays all of which fully meet the requirements. Would you suggest I should pick one at random and award a 1 in order to meet the quota? Conversely, I could receive five pieces of writing none of which were close to meeting the standards. Should I mark four of them as 2 regardless of quality?;I found similar. Two of the five had no thesis. One had an unclear/multiple thesis. Of the &apos;no thesis&apos; essays, one was simply a list of quotations from various stories with no obvious link between them and no explanation. Twelve paragraphs, only one of which contained a full sentence. The rest consisted of sentence fragments and quotes. The sentences and fragments also contained frequent spelling and grammatical errors to the point of not being able to determine the writer&apos;s intention. I don&apos;t see what I could do but grade that at 1 for both form and content.;Kerryn, you have hit on exactly the same interpretation as I had. I read the story as contrasting the pure and innocent Alice with the corrupted Victorian society. A rigid hierarchy where justice is determined arbitrarily from above (Knave&apos;s trial) where petty officials exercise power through the confusion of language and procedure (the Dodo) but where there is an idealisation of the child as an embodiment of innocence.;OP, while it may be that you gave more attention to your essay than you did this posting, I would point out that just in the few sentences above I noted 12 errors of spelling, grammar or usage. It is very difficult to spot errors in one&apos;s own work, that is why I always have important work proof read before submission.While individual peer assessments may well be inaccurate (in my experience they vary widely), the overall assessment is usually   accurate. Overall, I have found that peer assessors on most courses tend to be too generous in their marking with many choosing to overlook errors.I can&apos;t comment on the the assessments of previous work but would suggest that the focus might have been on other areas. For example, some courses (and teachers) overlook errors of grammar or usage in favour of content. It is also the case that, if your teachers were not themselves native English speakers, marking and grading may not always be perfect. I was surprised when meeting my wife&apos;s Professor of English to find her spoken language almost unintelligible and that her written English combined extremely dated vocabulary with frequent grammatical errors. This was a lady who had been teaching English at university level for over thirty years.Forgive me if my assumption that English is not your first language is incorrect.;By the way, where on earth do they have &apos;contests&apos; of grammar and punctuation outside of primary (elementary) school?;I wouldn&apos;t normally pick over a forum posting as nobody expects them to be grammatically or stylistically perfect but if you want me to mark the errors or awkward usage then here we go:I am finding it difficult to having  [having]  my essay being [- not required -]  judged by students.   One person said my grammar and punctuation were amiss. However, I have written for a very long time and know I had no errors in regards [regard]  to theses  [these]  aspects of my essay. The reviews of my essay was [were]  unnecessarily harsh and widely, overall,  [odd usage, not sure how to correct]  incorrect. I have written college level essays through [for?]  five different colleges,  [&apos;,&apos; not required]  for credits [credit].I have had my writing style evaluated by hundreds of instructors, none have had any concerns about my grammar or punctuation. In fact, I&apos;ve won a few &apos;contests&apos; rewarding these very aspects of writing. I am just perplexed on how I am so harshly judged by people who perhaps are not proficient in writing grade  [grading?]  and judge my work in   [to be of]  such a low caliber.I am not saying my essay was perfect, it was not. I know where I made mistakes. I also do not mean to sound harsh, disrespectful, or conceited, but I&apos;m finding these evaluations simply harsh, unfair and even incorrect in some instances [too many adjectives and repetition for good style].  If someone had many mistakes, I graded them a &apos;one&apos;, sure. However, I graded anyone who made just a couple of mistakes, a &apos;two&apos;. While I was given a &apos;one&apos; for even fewer mistakes. [incomplete - better include in previous sentence].No individual error is &apos;critical&apos; (I&apos;m not even sure what would make a grammatical error &apos;critical&apos;) but an accumulation of small errors can be tiring, Something that is less easy to illustrate is that the phrasing and word choice seem a little awkward overall and, for me, the writing does not flow smoothly. As I said at the opening of this post, I would never apply such a detailed critique of a posting unless asked as, in general, they are far more casual and ephemeral than formal academic writing.;Even more worrying is that they highlight errors which do not exist, make suggestions which are not appropriate to the audience and purpose and are generally a poor guide to writing. As I indicated earlier, my first essay was reported as having over a hundred critical errors. Just out of interest, I have now checked my second essay using the site linked early in this thread and I&apos;m excited to report that I have improved to only 17 &apos;critical&apos; errors!;I&apos;ve had a look at the grammar checker suggested and, to be honest, I would avoid it. I disagree with every one of the &apos;corrections&apos; suggested on samples of my own writing and samples from professional writers. Apparently words such as accurate or individual  are complicated constructions and to avoided. Moreover, the word lady is reflective of gender bias and should be replaced by woman!The OP will doubtless be happy to know that my essay had over a hundred critical grammatical errors. Fortunately, my peers either didn&apos;t agree or were far kinder than his. The problem, or one of the problems, with this sort of program is that it cannot take account of the audience and purpose of a document. It appears to be making recommendations suitable for a Junior High School audience who cannot manage to follow sentences with more than one clause or words with more than two syllables.Look to your peers. if one reviewer makes comments which seem unfair or inaccurate, ignore them. If all your reviewers make similar comments, think how you can address them.;It&apos;s sort of an ego/participation meterNot a terribly good one though. I wasn&apos;t even aware of the &apos;top poster&apos; link until you highlighted it!;I&apos;d certainly agree that the correct use of paragraphs is   important. The details of format such as indenting as specific to styles, such as MLA, and can&apos;t be properly implemented with the limited tools available when pasting (or typing driectly) into the submission box. MLA requires, for example, that all essays start with a header detailing the student&apos;s name, professor, college etc. Should I penalise students for omitting it? That style (as do most academic writing styles) also requires that text be double spaced and have a header, neither of which can be achieved here.Clarity and consistency are more important to me than the number of spaces used to indent (and MLA deprecate the use of spaces anyway for indents anyway, half inch tabs should be set). I&apos;m looking for paragraphs to correctly focus on a single idea and to link to both the preceding and following paragraphs. I&apos;m generally unhappy to see single sentence paragraphs and would wonder whether a three line sentence could not usefully be divided in the interests of clarity.;I&apos;ve yet to see anything which I would classify as deserving a three, certainly my own writing was not of an exceptional standard, objectively. I do have concerns about setting quotas. It is wholly possible that all five papers could be below standard or exceptional although it is more likely that all will meet the requirements and be graded as twos. Working to quotas when marking only five papers normalises over far too small a sample. Even when marking hundreds of papers (as might be the case in a or college school setting) one still needs to be cautious about not deviating from objective standards where the work is for externally accredited courses. Those who do so are far more likely to have their marking challenged through moderation.In the early stages of a course one is far more likely to see work which is clearly far below the expected standards. As the course progresses many of the lowest achievers will drop out (my experience on other courses suggests that those who have a very limited grasp of English are less likely to continue submitting assignments, for example) pushing up the average standard. In all likelihood some   90% or more of those registering will fail to fully complete the course (in line with the normal retention rates for MOOCs). Human nature being what it is, those finding it most difficult or least rewarding are the most likely to drop out.Given the above, I look forward to seeing exceptional work produced both by filtering and practice. I&apos;m not sure how easy it would be, in practice, to score a three for form. How does one more than fully meet the requirement in such a short piece? I can see much more easily how exceptional standards could be achieved in content. I also wonder how many will be able to separate the two elements and mark a well-argued but poorly presented paper as one for form but three for content.;I think there are two parallel and sometimes apparently contradictory aspects. While the writer obviously has some insight into his or her intentions and motivations, even the most self-aware is subject to unconscious influences. When the Grimm Brothers complied their stories did they think &quot;Hmm, we&apos;d better make sure the heroine is beautiful but reliant on men because that reflects our patriarchal view of society&quot;? I think it is unlikely (even if one accepts that interpretation). Writers are products of their society and reflect the attitudes and understandings even where they explicitly reject them.What is important is to consider the context of the writing and here the writer may have a critical input. Tolkein&apos;s Lord of the Rings  was often interpreted as an allegory for the rise of Nazism in Europe but this could be definitively debunked by the author on the grounds that the sections mentioned were written many years before the events they were supposed to reflect.Meaning, my psychologist wife tells me, is constructed by the reader within their own context and doesn&apos;t have any objective reality. I&apos;m not sure, as a scientist and engineer, that I&apos;m ready to accept the strict constructionist approach but it does have merit for literary analysis. What the writer intended to say is not always what the writer actually expresses. I&apos;ve certainly found myself in discussions saying &apos;that wasn&apos;t what I meant&apos; then looking again at what I had said or written and recognising different aspects to those I had intended to express.;I think that first person narrative is harder to do well. As has been alluded to earlier, it can narrow the perspective but this can be to the benefit of the story is gradual disclosure and understanding is desired. The advantage of first person narrative is that it allows far more seamless integration of the narrator&apos;s thoughts and feelings. As Laura says, I rarely notice the voice if the work is well written. Where it is poorly written every word can jar the nerves, regardless of person.;Luis, I rally think you are going to struggle if you are not confident in reading and writing English. machine translations are weak at best, and often wildly inaccurate. it may be worthwhile highlighting what it say in the Course Syllabus under Recommended Background:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable.Even with reliable translations, any direct quotes you take from the text are going to look &apos;odd&apos; if they have twice been through translation.;The article was interesting but not entirely convincing in regard to Dodgson. I had the distinct impression that the author had started from the conclusion and worked backwards to find evidence to justify it. It is true that drug use was far more casual in the nineteenth century than is the case even now but it was almost exclusively opium (which was available cheaply and easily after the Opium Wars with China). Opium was in wide use in all classes of society both by smoking (in the notorious opium dens) and through the widespread consumption of laudanum, a tincture (solution) of opium in alcohol. Sold as a patent medicine it was bought for it&apos;s narcotic qualities (being even cheaper than gin) to the extent that pharmacists would stock up ready for the weekend rush when workers were paid.Initially seen as a working class vice it quickly spread to all sectors of society - the poet Coleridge was famously addicted and wrote under the influence. Probably the most famous work associated with this form of addiction came from Thomas De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium Eater where he recounted his experiences as a laudanum addict.  So far as I can work it out (difficult as he measures his consumption in &apos;drops&apos;) he was getting through about a pint a day - a substantial hit of alcohol before getting to the opium!Dodgson was a churchman and academic. Although he moved in society there is nothing I&apos;ve seen to suggest that he was a drug user beyond the re-interpretations of his writings a century after the fact, in the light of the hallucinogenic drug culture of the 1960s.  ;Amanita Muscaria was then well known as fly agaric and used as a primitive insecticide. It was known to be poisonous and its distinctive appearance must surely have deterred accidental consumption. I don&apos;t recall the mushroom in Alice being described in terms matching this species.;I had the dubious pleasure of reading De Quincey about twenty years ago and have hardly recovered from the effort now. Not the easiest read.;The Apollo programme and its promotion by politicians was largely a response to the perception that the Soviet military-industrial complex had stolen a lead. It is difficult now to imagine the impact that Sputnik had both on American prestige and their sense of security. If the Soviets could place a satellite (however small and functionless) in orbit then they could clearly reach deep into the American heartlands with their weapons.The American people felt let down by their government and by &apos;science&apos; - which was supposed to have been their shield (as was later the case with Reagan&apos;s Strategic Defence Initiative aka &apos;Star Wars&apos;).     We shall go to the Moon  _    was partly political showmanship, given that the President would have been out of office before it came to fruition or failure, and partly a way to justify increased spending on science which had clear military application. Although Kennedy brought focus and set a target for   completion, the programme had already been planned in outline under the previous Eisenhower administration.     Let us not forget how quickly interest waned in the Apollo programme which was cut short before it&apos;s planned completion - only 11 of the planned 14 missions being completed (cutting the landings from 10 to 6 including the aborted Apollo 13 mission). I can remember watching the television broadcasts of the first landing but can also remember clearly how subsequent missions dropped off the news schedules, &quot;in further news,another Apollo mission landed today on the moon. Now, getting back to the Vietnam war reports...&quot;;My essay was not very inspired. It is sound enough and deserves 2s. If I could figure out what a 3 for form should look like then I&apos;d do it but the Alice stories, however much I&apos;d like to like them, just don&apos;t really interest me. Dodgson fascinates me as a person but his writings, although clever, just leave me cold.;I&apos;ve reviewed my share of peers and a few more and was a little disappointed to find the standards were, if not lower, certainly no higher than last time.One essay which was just a whisker off 3s for both form and content.Two which had no issues with form but absolutely no content - no thesis or conclusion and just a random jumble of observations.One which appears to have been through a machine translation, which didn&apos;t work. Even the book&apos;s title was mistranslated. Putting the language issues aside the form was flawed - nine paragraphs in 300 words is just too many. As it stands, over half the sentences are fragments (some having no verb, for example) and it really is impossible to determine the writer&apos;s meaning in a good third of the essay.Content is no better (so far as I can tell, given the garbled translation) with no thesis, common theme or conclusion. Sadly, 1s for both form and content.The rest of the essays were fairly straightforward 2s for both form and content. No more exciting than my own efforts but clearly written and argued.Once again the Works Cited appears to have defeated most writers. Web sites continue to appear in Works Cited when there is absolutely no reference to them in the text. Whether this is because the quotes were cut in editing or because the writers misunderstand the section as some sort of bibliography is unclear.;HiThe point of my posting which, I can now see, was not clearly expressed, was to get a general view on the trend in essays. Each of us sees only a minuscule sample so individually our observations have no statistical validity. I had posted on another thread that I anticipated a distinct upward trend, based on my experience on previous courses and on the usually high attrition rate. I hadn&apos;t seen this among the essays I had read and was interested in how others saw it.I&apos;ve no axe to grind, particularly in regard to those who do not have English as their first language. My wife, who has English as her third language, would certainly have something to say to me if I were to express such bias. On the other hand, I can&apos;t agree with the oft repeated request that we should ignore the quality of presentation because not all of us have the same background either academically or linguistically. A course must have objective standards and these seemed to be clearly stated in the rubric and in the expectations of the course as being equivalent to those expected of a college (ie university) undergraduate.It is important to distinguish between form and content and it should be perfectly possible to score well in one regard while performing badly in the other (within the constraint that the language must be clear enough to understand). The majority of work I have reviewed is solidly in the &apos;2&apos; ratings, as I hope mine is. This is in line with the professor&apos;s expectations. I have slightly more 1s than I&apos;d expect on average but that will almost certainly improve over the course.I always try to give specific and detailed advice to the students whose work I review and would hope that others would do the same. It is disappointing when simple &apos;mechanical&apos; errors mar an otherwise good paper and failing to highlight these does nobody any favours.;</string>
            <string>It wouldn&apos;t be unreasonable to imagine that people that don&apos;t submit an essay might be less likely to submit marksIf you don&apos;t submit an essay then you are not allocated any peer evaluations.The problem is that there is no way to know until the deadline for evaluations has passed whether a student intends to complete  a review. as I understand it, &apos;extra&apos; evaluations are aloocated at random.I&apos;d think it unlikely that staff would be in a position to get involved with assessments. bear on mind tha most courses start with 50-100,000 students enrolled.;All evaluations count and all feedback will be seen whether from the &apos;standard&apos; five or any &apos;extras&apos;. I&apos;ve had 6 on one occasion (on another course) and I know another student reported getting eight! Conversely, again on another course, some students received only one evaluation.;You should not be surprised to find little or no change in your gradings. As the instructions are written, the majority of work will always rate a 2. If you write a piece with a few structural or spelling mistakes most assessors would probably award that a 2 (I would anyway). If you then write a piece with no errors but without being exceptional quality (in terms of advanced undergraduate writing) you will still get a 2. I&apos;ve had 2s on both essays so far and don&apos;t really anticipate getting a 3 as I&apos;ve no background in literary criticism or of this type of writing. Although I hope to improve my writing, in order to improve my grade I would need to move from satisfactory to exceptional and, given that many of our peers are working to a strict 10% quota, that is unlikely to happen.For most students on this course 4 is how they will start and 4 is how they will end.;As a teacher you will know how difficult it is when you first start assessing other&apos;s work. Even more difficult is offering suggestions for improvement. While I would assume that most will be able to make a decent attempt at evaluating the quality of work, it is a big challenge to expect useful feedback from people who have never done this before.When I grade work for externally accredited courses my colleagues and I first mark exemplars supplied by the examining body so that we know we are grading to the right standard. We then moderate each others assessment (that is we mark a sample of our own students&apos; work and compare grades) to ensure consistency. Here we are all just jumping in and trying to do the best we can. As an experienced assessor and examiner (albeit in another subject area) I can only guess how hard that must be for those without any previous experience.;People are struggling enough to decide between fails to meet expectations, meets expectations and exceptional so you want to add &apos;exceptionally bad&apos; to the options? I wouldn&apos;t see it as helpful either to those writing or receiving the feedback.;A 5 point scale gives more granularity but, given that this course is peer assessed, is likely to give less consistent results. Why a five point scale rather than a 10 point or why not mark as a percentage? The answer is clearly that readers are not in a position to make such fine distinctions. Most of us, whatever our background, can recognise whether a work that broadly meets the requirement. Asking much more than that is unrealistic (in my opinion).I don&apos;t think a separate mark for referencing is necessary on this course as the majority of the work I have read required no references. External references are far less necessary in these short literary criticisms as opposed to longer forms or other subjects. I&apos;ve used no external references to date.On the other hand, I have seen frequent misuse of &apos;Works Cited&apos; with web pages being listed to which there were no direct or indirect references in the body of the text. Either citations were lost during editing for length or writers are using &apos;Works Cited&apos; as a general bibliography. Although I always comment on this, I would only penalise if there were other significant errors.;Dodgson wasn&apos;t &apos;fond&apos; of photography, he was considered one of the leading portrait photographers of his generation,;Lucy was amazingly lucky to survive the transfusions - unless she was blood type AB+ (which is rare - around 3% in the UK) then she had a 50/50 chance of fatal reaction on each transfusion!;Well, now that I have finally written my essay, I suppose I have a few minutes to make some general comments. I had read Dracula a couple of times previously but not for some years. I actually found I enjoyed it more this time although it still is far from being at the top of my &apos;favourites&apos; list. I think the style works well, giving a patina of realism, without getting in the way of the story. It also allows for multiple characters to give personal views which is difficult in any other form. The verbatim transcription of accent and dialect just didn&apos;t work for me. Not only were some parts almost indecipherable, it is not credible that a diarist would write in this way - particularly if, as in Mina&apos;s case, the journal is written in shorthand.I found the first half of the book the most effective. Once the &apos;action&apos; started it seemed less interesting and the ending was particularly disappointing, almost as if Stoker had lost interest by that point;Certainly British schools and universities are very weak in teaching academic writing - or to be more accurate, they simply don&apos;t teach it at all (and I say that as a teacher).Given the diverse backgrounds of students it might have been helpful to outline a basic essay structure that would support those with less experience or confidence. The course is, however, advertised as being broadly equivalent to advanced undergraduate level so maybe the expectation is that we should already know the basics.My suggestion, repeated a few times over the last couple of weeks, is to keep it simple:Introduction and thesis - what you want me to believeSupporting evidence - why I should believe youMore evidenceConclusion - link it all together and remind me what it is you are arguingIn general, I&apos;d expect each step to be one paragraph as each presents a separate idea. Given the word count this means paragraphs will be short. Try to avoid one sentence paragraphs as they annoy some reviewers and it can make the reading rather choppy. Keep sentences relatively short to match the very focused structure of this short-form essay.I should warn that one of my reviewers commented that he or she found my format &apos;formulaic&apos; so there is no guarantee that any particular style or format will satisfy everyone. My observation would be that we should always remember the audience and so simpler styles are appropriate here.;Our weather being what it is in Britain, I&apos;d certainly recommend keeping your pants on - and preferably a good stout pair of trousers too!  (For the avoidance of doubt that is a deliberate play on the different usage of &apos;pants&apos; between the US and UK);Noel, it makes perfect sense. I&apos;ve said on another thread that I really don&apos;t know what would characterise a &apos;3&apos; for form, although I hope that I&apos;ll recognise it when (if) I see it. The comment was actually quite fair, my essay was formulaic. I simply took the standard layout and plugged in the information I wanted to convey. There were no errors in spelling or grammar but there was also nothing &apos;special&apos; about it. It was competent and workmanlike, interesting but unexciting which probably reflects my background in technical writing.Having said all that, it is still a useful start for the many writers who are clearly losing out on these essentially mechanical skills rather than through lack of understanding of the subject.;I agree entirely. The suggestion I have made in more than one evaluation is to keep it simple. If you are a post-doctoral research fellow then by all means use your full range of technical vocabulary, while keeping in mind your audience. For the rest of us, stick to language with which you are comfortable and confident. While the tone should be relatively formal, it is more important to be clear and correct than &apos;academic&apos;. These are very short essays and there isn&apos;t room for rhetorical flourishes or meandering diversions. Tell me what you think (state the thesis). Tell me why you believe that (supporting evidence). Convince me you&apos;re right (conclusion).;It doesn&apos;t matter, the figures would come out the same either way. What you are doing is adding together 14 scores and taking the average.You could average each assignment then &apos;average the averages&apos;, or calculate the average of form and content separately and then average those two average - it wouldn&apos;t make any difference at all.Green average works out each assignment separately, red works out the elements separately. Trust me, I&apos;ve tried different combinations and it really does always come out the same!;averaging exactly 2 on  Form  and  ContentIn each of six assignments the student needs to average 2 for the two separate elements of Form and Content and submit a seventh essay (which can average no less than 1) in order to reach the &apos;Pass&apos; threshold.Note that if the scoring were as Joseph suggests then the next part of the quotation  one submission averaging exactly 1  would be impossible to achieve as the lowest possible mark for an essay would be 2 (1 in each of the two categories). It would also be impossible for any student to fail so long as they submitted something (or anything) for each of seven assignments as they would be guaranteed to score at least an average of 2 overall.;but do the math as I have done in my original thread:  6 submissions with 2, 1 with a 1, is 13 divided by 7,  This is were your error comes in, you have overlooked that each score is stated to be an average.Once again, from the page you quote:averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay                            [my emphasis]And, as I noted, it would be impossible to get a score of 1 if the basis were the total of the two marks. It is not possible to leave a score of zero - 1, 2 or 3 are the only options. The Work Expectations page describes the scheme thus:grading scale: 1 (inadequate), 2 (successful), and 3 (outstanding)You would suggest that achieving a grade of inadequate in every part of every essay should be classed as a &apos;Pass&apos;. That does not appear to be in line with the statement on the Course Syllabus page that:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students;If I score 2 for Form and 2 for Content, the average for that assignment  is:(2 + 2) / 2 = 2If I score 1 for Form and 1 for Content my average  for that assignment  is:(1 + 1) / 2 = 1Now I have scored averages of 2 for 6 assignments and an average of 1 for the seventh. My average overall is:(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 +2 + 1) / 7 = 1.85;A piece of work cannot be graded as 0 for one part only of Form or Content. Only 1, 2 or 3 exist as options. If you do not enter a grade for one part then the grading will not be accepted by the system.I really cannot accept that any course would take &apos;Inadequate&apos; in every part as equating to a &apos;pass&apos;, regardless of philosophy. I await with interest any feedback from the course team but I strongly suspect that you will be disappointed.;I agree. Joseph doesn&apos;t - his interpretation requires only 13 points in total from seven assignments.Drat! I promised i wasn&apos;t going to get involved in this discussion again.;Traditionally, academic writing was always in the third person. Even if you were referring to yourself, it was done obliquely, &quot;The researcher observed...&quot;. This is still pretty much the case in the natural sciences but humanities (so far as I can see - it&apos;s not my area of specialism) seem to have taken a more flexible approach in recent decades.Where I would have concerns in an essay is if &apos;I&apos; merely prefaces an unsupported personal opinion. Generally, the advice is to write positively so instead of &quot;I think the changes in size are a metaphor for puberty&quot; it might be better to phrase it &quot;Changes in size are a metaphor for puberty because x, y &amp; z&quot;. If you don&apos;t show confidence in your own thesis why should a reader accept it?;I wouldn&apos;t disagree. I am, personally, solidly in the third person camp, so to speak. I moderated my opinion, as expressed above in response to feedback on this course and elsewhere that indicated, certainly in the US, the use of the first person was increasingly common in humanities. I&apos;m not familiar with academic writing in this area, I am an engineer and teacher of IT by training and background, so when instructors, TAs and many fellow students all tell me I am mistaken I am inclined to reflect that when I give an answer. I use the third person and frequently a passive voice when writing formally. My wife does likewise in her writings in the field of psychology. All the peer-reviewed journals which I read follow the same style. This very topic was the subject of discussions recently with staff on my wife&apos;s Masters course. The advice there was that it would never be wrong to use the third person and that was the preferred style. The first person could be used (in psychology) when recounting personal experiences, for example in a qualitative study based on the participant observer model where the use of the third person might be unclear (e.g. in distinguishing the researcher&apos;s actions from those she is observing) or unnecessarily convoluted.;I can&apos;t speak to doctoral theses as I&apos;m not in a position where I would be reading them. Most of the research I read in peer-reviewed science journals is still solidly in the third party camp. As recently as last week I read an article which used exactly the formulation quoted earlier, &quot;In the course of the interview, the researcher observed...&quot;. The researcher was the writer. This is slightly unusual (which is why it stuck in my mind) as a more typical approach would have been to ignore the observer entirely &quot;During the course of the interview it was observed that...&quot; using the passive voice which is, along with the third person, still characteristic of scientific writing.I did not claim that the use of these styles was universal, even in the natural sciences. I did observe that the use of the first person was becoming more common.;I think we are probably both saying much the same things, just from slightly different angles. Your comment that it &quot;drives me batty to see that tired old third person and/or passive approach&quot; certainly suggests that the style is not unfamiliar to you.  A lot of my reading recently has been from my wife&apos;s psychology journals (she is just finishing her Masters and I am half-way through the Intro to Psychology here on Coursera) and it sometimes seems as if they are trying even harder to appear detached and impersonal than those in the traditional sciences.;We have here perhaps 1,000 students.A little conservative. I&apos;d guess that the number participating is still around 20-30,000 at this point in a course.;I&apos;m not sure that the use of the crucifix or communion wafer are actually &apos;religious&apos; per se. My reading is that they are merely used as amulets to ward off danger. That is to say they are seen not as symbols of faith but as items having inherent power (so a non-believer would enjoy the same protection as a believer).I don&apos;t think I expressed that distinction terribly well.  ;I try to use the third section for &apos;holistic&apos; comments about the essay. Sometimes, even after taking into account the comments on form and content there are overall remarks needed, either in praise or observation. For example, an essay might have one or two easily corrected grammatical errors and a fair content which just needed more focus. Those would be commented in the form and content sections. I might feel though that the overall tone of the piece was &apos;uncomfortable&apos;; too casual or too strained. I might want to congratulate the writer on a very easy and enjoyable piece even if, by dint of poor content, it scored badly.My comments in the form and content sections are very focused and specific. The final section will have far more general comments. Although I think that I have left comments every time so far in the third section, I can certainly imagine that I might not do so for a future essay if I had nothing worthwhile to say.;Have you experienced sarcasm?;Victor is a rather unpleasant and shallow character while the &apos;monster&apos; is more sympathetic, eloquent and intelligent (in the book) than his creator. This is presumably why the misidentification of the creature as &apos;Frankenstein&apos; became widespread so quickly.;Normally (ie on every other course I&apos;ve taken here that used peer assessment), if you didn&apos;t complete the peer assessment then you did not receive a grade at all and that is implied by the Professor&apos;s statement  Each time you submit an essay and return your evaluations of your fellows    essays in a timely way, you will be taken as having made one full submission.  The general notes say  If you have not finished your assigned evaluation tasks by this time [ie the deadline], your own assignment may not be evaluated and you may receive a grade penalty.  But this is the standard text on every course and it is up to the course team how they apply this. There is nothing to indicate that any penalty has been implemented for this course.;I have checked through the terms and, as I expected, there is nothing about ownership of assignments so normal intellectual property rights apply (that is to say, the creator holds the copyright). So, in principle, if the monkeys get lucky, any insights are their&apos;s and subsequent use should cite them.It is worth noting that for anything posted publicly on the forums or course Wiki you &quot;grant Coursera and the Participating Institutions a fully transferable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use, distribute, sublicense, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such User Content.  &quot;;by today&apos;s standardsDodgson does not live today and society then was quite different. There is no evidence that the children were &apos;sexualised&apos;, in fact, quite the opposite. Children were idealised as symbols of purity and the depiction of nude children was a common artistic theme and even on appeared on   Christmas cards.;The general rule on Coursera says &quot;If you have not finished your assigned evaluation tasks... your own assignment may not be evaluated and you may receive a grade penalty&quot; but it is up to the individual courses to decide how they implement this. Although the Professor says that a complete assignment consists of both submission and evaluation, from reports last time there appears to be no penalty.;I&apos;ve no problems with any argument being advanced so long as some support is shown in the text. On the other hand, my experience to date both here and on other courses, is that unpopular views are less likely to be well-rated regardless of merit.;If an essay fails to meet the expectations then it should be graded as a 1 - &apos;Inadequate&apos;. The course is Pass/Fail so I&apos;m not clear why you should want a lower grade.You cannot substitute essays in the way that you suggest; you are required to complete the assigned evaluations. In practice, it doesn&apos;t seem that any penalty is set up for those who fail to complete their evaluations (despite the generic warning that your work may not be evaluated or you may be penalised). Should you decide not to grade an essay then your &apos;non-mark&apos; will simply be ignored in calculating the overall score. I don&apos;t know what the situation would be if your peers all take the same line and there were no marks available, my suspicion is that a &apos;Pass&apos; grade would be awarded - but that is only a guess, I&apos;ve never seen any statement or come across this actually happening.;I can&apos;t get my head around pronouncing Mina as the prof. does. I had read it as &apos;Meena&apos; matching the pronunciation of the name of which it was a familiar or diminutive variant. I&apos;ve never actually come across anyone using this form so I&apos;ve no idea how others pronounce it. The only &apos;Wilhelmina&apos; I know is a great-aunt who was always known as &apos;Ina&apos; pronounced &apos;Eye-na&apos; just to ruin my theory! Incidentally, thinking about name choices. In the case of my great aunt, her father had wanted to name a son William but had eight daughters. On his wife&apos;s last pregnancy he swore that, come what may, the child would be christened as William. Fortunately, some sense was restored when his ninth daughter was born although it only stretched as far as taking a feminine variant. She was born (in Scotland) shortly after the turn of the twentieth century so not too long after Dracula was written but even then the name was seen as dated and cumbersome - hence its never being used in full.;</string>
            <string>How are the guidelines &apos;loose&apos;? The instruction from the peer evaluation page (as quoted by Patricia) seems perfectly clear. If we choose to quote from the &apos;Work Expectations&apos; page then why ignore:   Form    in this context refers to the writing itself, everything from spelling to grammar to clarityand from the Course Syllabus page:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable. For those also participating in the writing and written responses, which is recommended, some experience in writing about literature is desirable;Anyone taking part in the forum   can vote a post up or down by clicking the arrows next to the number. They should be used to highlight particularly interesting or valuable posts, not necessarily those with which the reader agrees. A poster could make an interesting and well thought out argument with which you totally disagree - but you should still vote it up! In practice, most of those who bother voting seem to behave as Maria describes, up if I agree, down if I don&apos;t.One small correction in terms of when you might use the &apos;flag&apos;. It should only be to bring serious problems to the attention of staff (the image below is the screen the flag brings up) and certainly not just because you disagree with a post. They might choose to remove a post or even, in extreme cases sanction or ban student.;Wow! I can&apos;t imagine what part of that posting caused someone to down vote it. Does someone not like my great aunt?;Professor Rabkin pronounces the name as Min-na to rhyme with &apos;mini&apos; - as he himself highlights specifically when identifying it as suggesting small.Although the pronunciation caught my attention, the observation would be valid anyway as she is the only character to be routinely referred to by a diminutive - nobody is calling Jonathan &apos;Johnny&apos; for example.By the way, how is the name pronounced in the film versions?;I agree overall; marks for content and form should be independent (so long as the work is readable - I had one which made no sense at all and I guess had been through a machine translation). There is no reason to leave rude comments but some are maybe just not too confident in expressing their suggestions.I don&apos;t support the idea that lower standards should be applied to those who do not have English as their first language. This is a literary course presented in English. If I were studying a course in another language I would expect to be judged on my ability to express myself correctly in that language. It seems rather patronising to suggest that non-native English speakers should have a more generous grading (and how would you know anyway - some of my own High School students produce far worse written English than many of the non-native speakers here). My wife has English as her third language but has strongly expressed her opposition to special pleading on that basis. In her studies here in the UK, both under- and post-graduate, the only concession was to be allowed the use of a bilingual dictionary during exams.;I&apos;ll just bring together a few points that I&apos;ve made in different posts. Professor Rabkin has taken the decision to make the &apos;grading&apos; as simple as possible - Pass (meets the requirements) = 2, Fail (Doesn&apos;t meet the requirements) = 1. To be honest, it might have been best to leave it at that point but, presumably to give an incentive to excellence, he also includes an additional Outstanding (significantly exceeds expectations) = 3.As those of us who are teachers should be aware, assessment is difficult. Giving useful feedback is even more challenging, especially where the assessor is inexperienced in assessing or the subject. My experience in this and a number of other courses suggests that peer evaluations will be close to the grade that an expert assessor might have awarded but that feedback is far more variable. My interpretation is that people can quickly learn to recognise the features which make for a Pass or Fail but are less able to justify this or to make suggestions for improvement.Are comments unnecessarily negative? Possibly, but I think this reflects the inexperience of the assessors rather than any malice. In trying to find suggestions to make readers often focus on the areas in which they feel most confident, so you may see detailed discussion of spelling or a particular grammatical point, for example. Comments on content often reflect the reader&apos;s own interpretations or a strict adherence to a particular model of essay writing.Going back to the original post, a score of 4 or 4.5 is fine. Professor Rabkin guided us that most work should be rated as 2. I&apos;ve received 4&apos;s for every assignment and am perfectly happy with that (it also matches my self-assessment). I&apos;ve awarded no 6s to date and won&apos;t be worried if I go through the course without doing so. I&apos;ve seen perfectly competent writing and some interesting ideas but nothing that strikes that spark of &apos;outstanding&apos;. To a degree this is all rather subjective, which I why I suggested it might have been better to leave it at a straight Pass/Fail but my impression is that most students, trying to be fair, err on the generous side of grading.;Unfortunately, it wouldn&apos;t be possible to assess the same peers each time.The drop out rate is such that most of those remaining at the end of the course would have nobody left to assess. Typical completion figures are in the region of 5-10%.;If you&apos;ve achieved 4 or more on the first three assignments then you are, effectively, half way to a pass (given that you can submit &apos;anything&apos; for your seventh and get a 2). You need to have scores under 4 for five or more of the essays before you need to really start worrying.;One reason you might be seeing a drop in your assessments is that the expectations of your peers is increasing both because they have more experience in this course and because many of the &apos;weaker&apos; students will have dropped out by this point (typical figures would suggest that around 80% of starters will have gone by now). Even if your work improves, it may be that the expectations are increasing faster. I&apos;m not saying this is right or wrong but this is my best guess.;I&apos;m not quite sure how you reach that interpretation from what I said. To clarify, from my experience as a teacher, the expectations of those who have less expertise in an area is generally lower than those with a greater level of expertise, even when guided as to the objective standards expected. If I know little about literature and have no experience of academic writing, I am likely to judge the quality of a piece of work more highly than if the same piece were evaluated by someone with a strong background in literary criticism and a familiarity with the conventions of academia. I&apos;m not claiming this to be a universal rule but it didn&apos;t seem controversial to me to me at the time of writing and nor does to seem so now.Most of us are here for self-improvement and pleasure. If we find we are struggling to keep up or to access the material effectively then it would seem natural to drop a course and find something more suitable or appealing. Given that 90-95% of all registered participants fail to complete most MOOCs, it seems that most people share that view. I have certainly dropped a number of courses because they were not as I expected or were just too difficult, given my current learning. In the latter cases I then had to decide whether I was interested enough to do more preparation and try again on the next offering or simply to leave it and move on.Nowhere did I suggest that one should &apos;make the competition drop out&apos;, nor would it make sense to do so. Firstly, we are not marked competitively - nobody knows or cares whether my final grade places me in first or ten thousandth place. Secondly, if my assertion is correct, that weaker students will grade more highly, it would surely make sense to encourage their continued participation in order to garner higher scores.  Going back to the original question of why grades might appear to fall,   Professor Rabkin said in the introductory video (00.03 How to Write for this Course): Notice that the hypothetical  student, the intelligent, attentive,  fellow student in the class with every  unit will know more than was known before.  Will be more sophisticated than before. So  this assignment. Enrich the reading of the  intelligent, attentive fellow student in  the course actually is more and more  demanding as we go from unit to unit.;  I do know also, that most people read at the 8th grade level  Francine, with your training I need hardly remind you, &quot;audience and purpose&quot;...;I could have given someone a lower score not knowing that this week they have vastly improved their understanding of the workWhich would have been correct as we are marking whether a piece meets the requirements, not whether the writer has improved. Within the bounds of subjective judgements, the marking is absolute, not relative.;Forum participants can vote a posting up or down by clicking on the arrows below the post or comment. In principle, by highlighting exceptionally informative or interesting posts they can be seen more easily by other students. Conversely, posts which give inaccurate information or are needlessly argumentative can be &apos;down-voted&apos;.I said &apos;in principle&apos; because, in practice, the points don&apos;t seem to have much effect. Unlike some other courses, the default sort order for posts seems to be date order rather than &apos;popularity&apos; (although it&apos;s also possible that I&apos;ve just fiddled with my settings and everyone else is defaulting to popularity!). Moreover, the voting often seems more to reflect the reader&apos;s agreement (or disagreement) with the post than being an objective indication of quality; so a well-written and argued posting putting forward an unpopular position is unlikely to gather much support.;Laurie, thanks. I know that you can choose the order but the default here seems to be date order. On some other courses it defaulted to &apos;Popularity&apos; or (&apos;Top Threads&apos; when viewing a forum). If I change the sort order by clicking the button, this choice is not remembered when I come back or even when I move to another thread. Now that doesn&apos;t bother me as I want date order anyway but it does seem to make voting &apos;pointless&apos;, if you&apos;ll excuse the pun!;There are, based on the postings I have read, a number of teachers (myself included) on this course and active on the boards. What is easy to forget, when one is experienced in assessing work, is just how difficult it actually is to give useful feedback. I&apos;ve received feedback which is vague, contradictory and just plain wrong, but I&apos;ve no doubt that the vast majority are making an honest attempt to do their best.My experience, the comments on forums both on this course and others and the available research all suggest that peer evaluators do pretty well, as a body, in grading. I&apos;ve seen relatively few complaints on that front beyond a few &apos;Why aren&apos;t I getting 6s yet?&apos;. What is far more difficult, and something that I&apos;ve not seen any research addressing in detail, is giving individual feedback to explain the grading or to suggest improvements. Even in my own specialist area, IT, I sometimes find myself (metaphorically) scratching my head to give my students feedback on how to move a piece of work from a Pass to a Distinction. In those cases I often have to fall back on a point by point analysis of the mark scheme (i.e. rubric) to identify where they lost points even though I was able to accurately assess the work quite quickly. Here peer evaluators don&apos;t have detailed guidance and the grading is a very broad-brushed Fail/Pass/Outstanding. I don&apos;t find it surprising that many can give only fragmentary advice or that, given the varied language and cultural backgrounds, the comments can seem curt or even insulting.Peer evaluation and feedback is an imperfect tool but the only realistic option for free courses of this type. Even when you feel that the real root of poor feedback is that the reader simply didn&apos;t understand what you were saying, this has value because, as Professor Rabkin highlighted in his introductory videos, we don&apos;t write in isolation but rather should always consider audience-and-purpose.As I said in a posting way back at the start of the course, those who can&apos;t live with peer assessment have two choices, audit the course without submitting assignments or go to your local college or distance learning provider and pay for a professionally assessed course. By way of example, the Open University here in the UK (where I earned my first degree) will charge   2563 for UK or EU students to take the course  20th century literature: texts and debates  which includes 6 professionally assessed written assignments and individual tutor support (by email or telephone). This is, of course, a far longer course anticipated as taking 15 hours of study per week 30 weeks and equates to 17% of a full Bachelors degree.;The comment in regard to the options for those who can&apos;t accept the limitations of peer assessment wasn&apos;t particularly aimed at any of the posters here but was for the wider group and harking back, as I indicated, to a discussion in the first week of the course. I included the comment because I had just looked at the Open University site and had been surprised to see how much the fees had increased recently. Rather than being   500 to   1,000 as   I remembered they are now   1,200-  2,5000.I should say that they only way I could afford to take a degree course was to do so on a part-time distance learning basis while working full-time throughout the entire six years that it took to complete. Even now, I certainly couldn&apos;t justify spending   2500 to satisfy a casual interest in literature. Although I&apos;ve been involved in some sort of education or professional development for most of the last twenty years or so, every minute of that was aimed directly at career development... until the arrival of MOOCs. I greatly value the opportunities that are presented to learn the things that interest me rather than advance my career but I think it is important that we recognise the limitations of the format. If we have an unrealistic expectation of our peers&apos; ability to give specific and helpful feedback then we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. I would, of course, encourage everyone to consider how they can improve the feedback they leave and how they can   get the best value out of the feedback they receive - which I think was the point of both the original post and my earlier contribution.. We should remember that most participants in MOOC courses never access the discussion forums (figures suggest that around 10% access the boards at some time with maybe 1% being regular visitors) so whatever encouragement we give here will be reaching mainly those who are already predisposed towards community involvement. In a way we are &apos;preaching to the converted&apos;. This is also, in part, why every discussion of feedback starts &apos;I always give great feedback - how come I get   one word comments?&apos;, because the people posting here are not typical students. Based on research, the typical MOOC student views some of the videos, does just enough on the assignments to pass and drops out when interest wanes. The typical &apos;frequent poster&apos; (i.e. a student strongly involved with the community aspects of a course) studies all the videos in detail, follows up additional research, discusses and develops the ideas and strives to achieve 100% in all assignments. They are also far more committed and more likely to complete a course; there is a strong positive correlation between the time spent on the discussion forums and the likelihood of successful completion.Sorry if this post has gone on rather too long and drifted from the original discussion. I&apos;m spending way too much time on the boards as I&apos;m &apos;home alone&apos; while my wife and son are away visiting relatives overseas.;One of my (many) grammatical failings is the overuse of commas (or, failing that, the use of parenthetical comments). One of my pet hates is the misuse of apostrophes. A perfect post.;Isn&apos;t that what the (anonymous) opening post said, albeit in a more light hearted way?;Surely the peer assessment page is quite clear, for each part; 1 is Fail, 2 is Pass and 3 is Outstanding?I think Professor Rabkin&apos;s explanation is a little unhelpful, perhaps statistics is not his strong suit or maybe he wasn&apos;t familiar with the constraints of the Coursera marking system. Talking of students getting an &apos;average of 2&apos; on an assignment can lead to some confusion as Coursera doesn&apos;t display or calculate the results in that way (in fact, Coursera&apos;s whole progress tracking is very weak compared to, say, edX). As we can see, the marks for the two parts are added rather than averaged, so the target then becomes 4 points for a &apos;Pass&apos; on an individual assignment.To achieve a Pass overall students need to have an average displayed score of 3.6 from the seven best marks which equates to 26 points overall.Ignoring the possibility of 5&apos;s or 6&apos;s, and for most of us that should be a fair assumption, this means that from the available ten assignments you need to pass six (and submit a seventh, regardless of mark). This would give:((6 x 4) + 2) / 7 = 3.7I have three assignments with 4 on each so far. That means I&apos;m nearly half way to a Pass. Three more 4s plus 2 for the seventh would meet the minimum grade.If you are lucky enough to be getting grades of 5 or 6, or unfortunate enough to have grades below 4   then you&apos;ll need to do a little maths to get your total - just add the seven best scores and divide by seven.;Yes, an essay must have a clear thesis. This doesn&apos;t have to be explicitly stated &quot;My thesis is...&quot; but it should be apparent to the reader and ideally stated in some way in the first paragraph. Overall, I&apos;d say that about half of the essays I have read either didn&apos;t have a thesis or has an unclear thesis (for example, one appeared to have three unrelated theses raised in the first paragraph, but no further reference appeared in the rest of the essay to any of them).;</string>
            <string>With respect, I don&apos;t think that is what Alan is wrote. He says that it is acceptable to pursue a number of theses so long as these are clearly outlined, with which I would agree. The point of an essay in this context is to propose a view and show how that is supported, not to undertake a general orientation in literary analysis. This is also in line with the guidance on marking which calls for a clear structure including thesis, evidence etc.;</string>
            <string>As has been highlighted a couple of times in this thread, receiving an essay that doesn&apos;t directly address the assigned material would tend to set alarms ringing. This is a fairly common tell-tale   for plagiarised work. Instead of reading, digesting and interpreting the readings, some dishonest students just make a quick search for something that seems relevant. Cut&apos;n&apos;paste to size and Bob&apos;s your Uncle - job done.Sorry to sound cynical but I&apos;ve seen it often enough among my own students and have seen some blatantly copied work on various MOOCs. If you can&apos;t keep up or the work is getting out of your grasp then skip an assignment (as I did this week - I just didn&apos;t have time to do the task justice), drop out or go to an auditing role. Don&apos;t waste your own time and that of your peers by blindly copying someone else&apos;s work.;</string>

            <string>Many text editors, as well as OpenOffice and LibreOffice, also have a word count tool. And if you happen to be familiar with the command line in Linux or Mac OS X,   &apos;wc&apos; will return the number of characters, words, and lines in a text document.  If you&apos;re used to think in terms of characters, the average number of characters in an english word being about 4.5 your essay should contain between 1215 and 1440 characters.In my experience, a good way to deal with space limitations is to write the first drafts without trying to be exacting about them and then pare the final drafts down to regulation size.;Can we add titles to an essay? This comment is an experiment to find out if we can.;The title did show up. This is what one can do: There are three tabs at upper right corner of the entry box: Rich, MD,     and HTML, each one of which corresponds to an entry mode. I believe MD     is the default mode. To enter the title just write, while in MD mode, the     text inside the quotes: &apos;### Title&apos; Do not type the quotes. If you know HTML you may instead choose HTML mode and use the h1 tag. With HTML it is easy even to insert pictures:                     ;When I wrote the comment &quot;Can we add titles to an essay?&quot; I assumed that the essay form had the same options as a comment form. It does not.The only way to include a title, should one be needed, would be to use boldface.;Word limits and other constraints may in fact enhance the creative process.My freedom thus consists in my moving about within the narrow frame that I have assigned to myself for each one of my undertakings. I shall go even further: my freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I surround myself with obstacles.

Would it be nonsensical if I put some on my pan fried tarantula? ;Alice in Wonderland, mad as it is, might not be far from being a realistic metaphor of madness in the real world: the madness of global warming, unbridled greed, and pious murder and suicide.

In an strict logical sense you can&apos;t. Our brains construct meaning from both what we perceive and what is in our memory. You might want to ask instead if your interpretation is reasonable enough to be accepted by your intended audience.This posture might take us, I know, close to the quicksands of propaganda, advertising, and other forms of deceit.So you just have to trust your judgement   and the judgement of the community that in turn interprets your interpretation.;South of Venezuela, my home country, there are indigenous communities     that to a significant extent still preserve their traditional ways. Some     years ago, while visiting a Yekwana village, I spoke in Spanish with a     teacher at the local public school. I asked him what sort of work they     did.

            <string>Folktales are not &quot;there&quot; to teach children something, they are &quot;community or family   entertainment&quot;. The edition of some stories and their adaptation and didactisation targeted to children came only later. If you find that too drastic to read, just have a look at your latest TV programme. Also, back then, children did not live such protected lives. Most of them have seen several siblings die, even in wealthy families.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_RomanticismHere is a short link to German romanticism. The Grimm Brothers were mainly linguists, they wrote an enormous handbook of the German language (how the meaning of words changed over time) that is still in use. The folktale collections were just a side project for them - but mediawise they were very advanced. for example they did not really travel that much from place to place to collect these tales, but they put adds in the newspapers and asked people to submit them or to meet them so they could take notes. Many of the tales are also variations of even earlier French tales. All of that happened around the time of the French Revolution - and I think partially these stories and their effort to conserve the German language has to do with the turmoil all around them. They wanted to create a German &quot;nation&quot;, with one language and a folktale tradition of their own   (which did not really exist back then, there were just many different districts and small states, only loosely connected through a language).;   It&apos;s not about &quot;a&quot; moral, I think. In Hans in luck, you can see how the rhetorics of  advertisements have worked on him. He always finds desirable what he  does not (!) have, after having listened to a good pitch. But once he  has it, it becomes useless, because he finds out that it does not fill  him with the satisfaction he desired, and there is always something  wrong with it. At the end he can let go of everything, because what he  really wanted   was being with his mother again. There is no moral like  &quot;never trust a stranger&quot; or &quot;every property is a burden&quot;, but the text  tells is something about how belongings, cravings, needs and desires are  often mismatched.;I don&apos;t think   it is a &quot;second part&quot; - just another story where the female character has the name &quot;Else&quot;;Karishma, they are not necessarily supposed to have &quot;morals&quot;. Grimm Brothers just published an edition for children with those stories that could be used for educational purposes, and they took the most cruel stories out (for example there is one where a father cuts off the hand of his daughter, to prevent her from marrying someone), but that does not mean that all of them were supposed to   have a simple &quot;message&quot;. ;I just mean &quot;meaning&quot; is almost never - or only in very bad texts reducible to &quot;a&quot; message or moral. for example they tell a lot about family dynamics... how power shifts, when 2 become 3 or 3 become 4 (Hansel and Gretel), or about the emotional engineering of becoming greedy. For example in Hans in luck, you can see how the rhetorics of advertisements have worked on him. He always finds desirable what he does not (!) have, after having listened to a good pitch. But once he has it, it becomes useless, because he finds out that it does not fill him with the satisfaction he desired, and there is always something wrong with it. At the end he can let go of everything, because what he really wanted   was being with his mother again. There is no moral like &quot;never trust a stranger&quot; or &quot;every property is a burden&quot;, but the text tells is something about how belongings, cravings, needs and desires are often mismatched. These texts rather tell us something about how we feel and function - they don&apos;t teach us how we should act. I don&apos;t know why you find them lame - I don&apos;t. ;</string>

            <string>Hi, sorry that I couldn&apos;t possibly read through the whole thread. But I do think that in Dracula, female characters often are used as a coppula or medium   through which   &quot;more important&quot; exchange (of text or body fluids)   between men (!) is organised. In Lucy&apos;s case it&apos;s her actual body through which blood of different men circulates, in Mina&apos;s case, it&apos;s her task as some sort of &quot;secretary&quot; that connects the documents of different men and creates their symbolic union. There is a latent male homosexual dimension to this - but its problem is rather that it isn&apos;t open , but still needs these 2 females to distribute or channel it.;</string>
            <string>The settings in these   stories are medieval but also have touch of Gothic romance.The castles, demons and supernatural beings create a highly fantacized situation. These stories are still read and enjoyed and quoted because they have universality of human behaviour. The issues presented in these stories are still alive in every societies and can be realized.;When the maiden blindly obeys her mother she gets into trouble. In that I agree with Selena. That was my first feeling when I red the story.This maiden is not a fool, anyway. So getting into trouble turns out to be a way of learning. She becomes sort of a trickster and escapes her quasi-slave condition in the rabbit&apos;s hutch. I think the rabbit as a corruptor is a fine figure, Cesar.So, it would be nice to know that next time mother and daughter will talk to each other before making decissions. Mothers don&apos;t know everything after all.;I also thought of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; while reading this tale. While reading the passage in which the maiden goes away with the rabbit, images from Tim Burton&apos;s film were sort of called up.;I love that too. The way she manages all by herself to get free... it&apos;s great.;&quot;Seeing structural violence as well as physical violence embedded in  stories as the natural order, or what is morally right, time after time  after time, though, can be wearing.&quot;Thanks a lot for the good thinking, Karen.;Thanks for sharing that interesting info.

            <string>Interesting thread Anna.

Aylmer looked cheerfully into her face, with intent to reassure her, but was so startled with the intense glow of the birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a strong convulsive shudder. His wife fainted.&quot; [Position 100]Instead of locking her in that lab without windows, he should have lived happily with her out in the sunshine, where the mark would have become diluted in Georgiana&apos;s healthy face.But in that case we hadn&apos;t got this beautiful story to enjoy :)Trying to focus, I think this story is a good example of one important theme in Hawthorne&apos;s work: the obsession, and the hiding of that obsession.;This answer to the last question is going to sound infinitely naive: Take our money out of the bank where it is now, if that bank is not transparent enough?

I feel that Kropotkin was a very interesting person (in an attempt to make a graphic novel a couple of years ago, I gave him a role in the story). If you get to like him, perhaps it can be useful when we come to H.G. Wells. Wells was a student of Thomas H. Huxley, who has relation to Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution by Kropotkin.You know much more than me about William Godwin :)About Frankenstein and anarchism, I would propose a different connection: Mary Wollstonecraft, the mother of Mary Wollstonecraft-Shelley.

Perhaps I misunderstood.;Surely you are right. Only allow me a little speculation.I can imagine that Lucy is covered in blood because there was a blood exchage similar to that between Mina and Dracula (Mina drinking from Dracula), but we readers are not told about it. That can be biased for having seen Coppola&apos;s film before my reading.I can also Imagine that marks on the children&apos;s necks are smaller because Dracula adapts his fangs to his victims.

In this film there is a teacher of science who is great, in my opinion.The last difference I&apos;m going to mention: the boy&apos;s relation to his family.

In the biography of Hawthorne I&apos;m using, I&apos;ve found the following:&quot;His first readings had been allegories: The Pilgrim&apos;s Progress by John Bunyan (1628-1688) and The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser (1552-1599).&quot; But in the video 04.02-&quot;From Romance to Science Fiction&quot;, Professor Rabkin says: Sydney (07:03), and Philip Sydney (14:10).I don&apos;t know yet if I will cite &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, but if I do and I say it is by Spenser, am I making a mistake?

It remembered me of another video: 02.07 Fantasy and the Continuum of the Fantastic. In particular, what he says about &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; by A. Christie.;Great info :);When I was 14 I read some stories by Isaac Asimov. But a year later I found one of my favourite writers of literature (without adjectives) since then, Stanislaw Lem. I fell in love with Ijon Tichy in DZIENNIKI GWIAZDOWE, which in spanish is Diarios de las estrellas. I&apos;m going to wiki, wait a moment...The Star Diaries.

On the other hand, when Griffin says: &quot;And I, a shabby, poverty-struck, hemmed-in-demonstrator, teaching fools in a provincial college, ...&quot; That sounds like the young Wells working so hard that his health deteriorated.Maybe I need a little distance from Wells&apos; life... but it is so interesting!;While watching the video 05.04, I did scribble this: &quot;the dramatic structure is Oedipal [...] a conflict of power between one generation and the next&quot;;Great post!

It made me think of another wonderful piece of art, a graphic novel by Apostolos Doxiadis, and Christos Papadimitriou:Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth;I had a great time with this story. I&apos;m not telling how it ends. But the end is something. It brought to my mind one of the most disturbing endings in science fiction, the one in FIASCO by Stanislaw Lem.Have you got a favourite science fiction end?;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>The term &quot;child logic&quot; and &quot;adult logic&quot; is very appropriate.   Alice, very innocently, gives us moral and social values such as speaking truth, showing courtesy to others, keeping things clean and tidy and asking permission for taking things. The rural environment, the animal companions symbolize purity and honesty that makes us more cultured and decent. Thus, I feel I grow and grow and grow.;I had read just one story of Alice quire casually but now I have developed interest in reading more of it. Now I realize the word-play and the world-building is reality fascinating. The way she enjoys her knowledge of words such as longitude and latitude is really humorous. The rural setting, her innocence, her love for animals and gardens take us to a fascinating world where every thing happens as we wish. In fact this world is more soothing to elders than small children. Lewis Caroll has gone deep into the psyche of a child. His pun, humour and visual images are wonderful.;</string>
            <string>I completed my second assignment and saved it but it could not be submitted due to error in my system. Can my saved work be considered ?;</string>
            <string>Reading big volume with small font is quite hectic particularly a classic novel. But, I am trying hard on it.;Very true. Mary&apos;s experiences regarding love and relationships have varied forms but beyond her personal life I find   violation of the universal bond between the Creator and the Creation. God created man on the basis of true divine love and created the Earth as a gift to him. But in this novel the creature&apos;s ingredients are not pure Earth rather, body parts of corpses are used and the intentions behind this creation is not love or intimacy but a sense of pride and victory, feelings of having knowledge and power equal to the supreme power. On the other hand, the creature also doesnot have love and intimacy for the creator rather, he developes feelings of revenge against   his own maker. Thus, the relationship between the two main characters is based on quest of knowledge farther than the limits   allowed by the Supreme God, attaining super power, selfishness, violence and hatred.;</string>
            <string>The comparison is very helpful and thought provoking.   It proves that science can provide facilities and comforts to human life but it is not the ultimate end. It can not conquer nature that is the supreme power.;</string>
            <string>I have just read the story and found it very interesting.   I think it is   about the acceptability of our defficiencies inflicted upon us by nature and cpmpatability with nature.. Nature is never harsh or cruel. If it takes one abilty it bestows some others to compensate it as in case of these blinds. Nature had taken away their eye sight but had sharpened their other senses. I also observed that those people adjusted themselves to their surroundings and lived a normal life   because they were living in pure nature without the   havoc of the modern science and technology.   Anyhow it is my opinion.  ;</string>
            <string>You might look at it as something to fear, but not getting a course achievement document is the only risk you have. You could always stick around and learn, but not necessarily take the whole thing on as a challenge on your plate. It&apos;s different from school in some very useful ways.;I agree with Casey.   Life is short.   What are you waiting for?   Get on with it and give it a go. Frankly we are all our own worst critics.   I&apos;ll not hear anything more of it.   You must do this course and you must do it now!;</string>
            <string>Like Georgia, one of the reasons I took this course is to develop my skills as a writer.   The word-limit is huge for me, as in I&apos;m challenged when keeping writing to 500 words.   I also wanted to find out what an &quot;attentive&quot; reader is and how to become one.   I have always read rapidly and know I absorb much more when I reread favorite books.   However, I want to learn how to read more thoroughly and with greater understanding the first time through a book.   In addition, reading fantasy and science-fiction has been a lifelong love of mine.   There was a time when I refused to read anything else.I&apos;m going out on a limb here and let you in on a closely-guarded secret of mine.   I fully intend to finish writing a fantasy book this year and to begin a science fiction one after that.   The primary reason I&apos;m taking this course is that I think, if I&apos;m a better (more attentive) reader, I&apos;ll be a better writer.In fact, I don&apos;t know anyone where I live who devours fantasy and science fiction like I do except for my son.   I am in need of a few people who could read and critique my book when I think it&apos;s finished.   (My son wouldn&apos;t be unbiased.)   Then I would be able to do my rewriting with much more confidence.   Anyone interested?   It would be very much appreciated.   Keep in mind, it&apos;s not likely anything will be ready for a few more months.;I think the point about patterns is a good one, especially when we look at the tales from an oral perspective. It&apos;s like in the Odyssey where there are set phrases that repeat again and again.  Nice.;</string>
            <string>The problem summary:I tried opening up the Grimm assignment on my computer. I found (not to my surprise) that the adobe pdf reader was slow and cumbersome. As someone who uses my home computer every day for my job, I am used to fast programs. The adobe PDF reader is not fast. Scrolling down is a chore in the program. In a word, abode sucks.Instead, let&apos;s try using a kindle.  If you have a physical kindle, this page will explain how to transfer files from your computer to your kindle.http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_navbox_usb_200375630?nodeId=200375630&amp;#usbWhile I did try testing out amazon&apos;s kindle program for the computer, I found that the pdf files did not synchronize with the kindle program just by adding it to the folder where it was supposed to be. The program synchronizes with your physical kindle and vice versa.Types of files you can read in the kindle (that I know of):-.txt files-.pdf files-amazon.com public domain (ie, free) books;That&apos;&apos;s the way I understand it.   The Syllabus says, &quot;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane  translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online  through Project Gutenberg.&quot;   Since, later on, only certain stories by Hawthorne are to be read, it seems to me that all the stories in the Lucy Crane translation are to be read, no matter where you find them.   Of course, why go hunting when a link is provided?   :-)   Hope this helps.;</string>
            <string>Peter summed it up nicely.   Like Elizabeth I, too, am an older student.   While we had, at home, the rewritten Disney fairy tales, I was in elementary school when I discovered not only the Grimm brothers but the Red Fairy, Blue Fairy, Green Fairy, etc. books at the library.   (Gutenberg has them.)   I could lose myself in so many different worlds.   Yes, parts of them were scary.   No, I couldn&apos;t read them on the level we as adults read them.   However, I definitely picked up the message Peter stated so succinctly.   Ten or more years ago I remember reading something about many of the Grimm brothers&apos; fairy tales being &quot;sanitized&quot; for the same reasons Elizabeth questions their being read by children.   I thought then that was going overboard, and I still think it.   Many children&apos;s movies have adult connotations and jokes that children aren&apos;t going to &quot;get.&quot;   Children still enjoy the movies.   Much better a child read fairy tales, including the Grimm brothers, than watch horror movies as I&apos;ve seen many parents let their children do.;</string>
            <string>The Grimm&apos;s Tales book is too large a file to go over WiFi or the whisper net. I put mine on my kindle as a PDF and open it through adobe. I do have a fire, so the app is required to read PDFs on it.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m using the google docs app to write my essays.  It&apos;s free and has the added benefit of being visible from other computers. ;I don&apos;t remember not being able to read.  I know both of my parents spent time reading with me and there was a bookshelf in every room.  I&apos;m never without a book, even if it&apos;s the kindle app on my phone. ;I agree.   I think it would be helpful to have the background lectures before writing our essays, much the same way a survey class like this would work in a typical college course.   ;</string>
            <string>This was my experience as well.  I just completed my BSN so I&apos;m still in my scientific writing, APA mode.  It was challenging to switch back to a different style of writing.  I got a 4 and I&apos;m happy with it.  I also received some good feedback.   ;</string>

            <string>Now I feel really unoriginal.   :)   I wrote on the Birthmark as well, it definitely resonated with me.   It also helped that it was the first of the stories that I read so I had more time to digest the material.

            <string>Sharla, you share a last name with one of the greatest Sci-Fi authors! Also, I spend a lot of time out in Tacoma, so I&apos;d be more than willing to meet up around your area now and again for some discussion! Do you like coffee/tea?;One of the things that stands true about the Grimm tales as opposed to audio files for other readings, which Professor Rabkin commented on in the introduction video, is that originally these stories were told orally. I definitely agree that often times you get a different feel for something when it is read allowed but in this case, I don&apos;t think you&apos;re cheating yourself one way or another. The Grimm brothers collected so many stories and are the reason we still have many of them but they were not written to begin with.I think it&apos;s easier to picture the stories being told around a hearth after the sun has set with the noises of the outdoors beyond a family&apos;s door if they&apos;re heard aloud. I think you can get something incredible from being able to picture and interpret the stories though this context. It will likely be very different from what someone holds on to if they&apos;re reading the text and can easily go back to reread a sentence, but it is just as valid.;It probably also makes them more meaningful to the audience. While stories like these were probably told in taverns and at larger town events, a large part of the audience was children. A child often understands and identifies better with another child. The lesson or point of the stories aren&apos;t dumbed down any but the cultural spin and inclusion of children in the stories makes them more easily accepted by the children hearing them.;</string>

In the tales, these journeys represent the hero&apos;s coming of age, and his recruits and items represent the skills developed in his journey towards manhood.While this trope is present in different tales, one key aspect that changes is the degree of awareness the hero has about his development. In  The Queen Bee, the hero is unaware of the troubles he will face, and is only concerned about following his instincts and thrice rejecting to cause suffering to innocent creatures.  The White Snake  presents a similar premise, in which the hero goes a step further; he tries to quench his curiosity by eating the snake, and receives the ability to understand the creatures that suffer. After helping the creatures, he becomes aware that he shall be rewarded.The Knapsack, the Sack and the Horn, present a hero in a later stage of development; he is aware that he needs a set of special skills to overcome his brothers. Through his journey not only does he collect items but learns to use them to the point where he can defend himself when one of his treasures is used against him. The hero&apos;s development reaches its maximum in  Six Soldiers of Fortune, where the protagonist is fully aware of the components he needs to amass in over to overcome his final challenge.&quot;Now, I am a made man and it is time to go home again and see how my brothers are faring&quot;[1]. The increase in awareness is a sign of growth; and being aware of his own development, the hero discovers what skills are worth learning and mastering.Here are the comments for FORM (grade: 2)peer 1      The sentences are correct, the words are properly used and the arguments are clear.

Nice piece of thoughts emerged on the paper.Here are the comments for CONTENT (grade: 2)peer 1      The essay shows a possible interpretation of the tales cited and the arguments are sound. The student should try to focus on one or two specific tales and try to find more patterns between them.  peer 2      The main argument of the essay was persuasive and insightful.  peer 3      This essay shows and offers us good understanding about the heroes in Grimm tales and the arguments makes sense and reveals the significance of insight and this essay also had given us enough details that is needed.  peer 4      Analysis is coherent and well argued, with compeling examples. Well done.  peer 5      As I said before, this text has everything what has to be. Speaking about signs and symbols in the text, with good score about metaphor, deep metaphor about life and growth of mankind, or one man particularly, are all what one text need to have on it&apos;s own. Thoughts in essay are clear and deep, and mentioned without question what is the thing that writers (brothers Grimm) wanted to say the most.

In the first story, Alice is quick to judge the inhabitants of Wonderland and call them on their &quot;nonsense&quot;; whereas in the second, Alice is more receptive to the idea of Looking-Glass Logic. In Wonderland, Alice is confused by the citizens&apos; behavior because she compares them to her &quot;real world&quot;, while in LGLang she is more understanding due to comparing their actions to a &quot;mirror&quot; paradigm instead.In Wonderland, the Mad Hatter explains that Time works different for him than for Alice, yet &quot;[his] remark seemed to have no meaning in it, despite being clearly English&quot;, so she dismisses the subject. Contrastingly, in LGLand she shows more openness once she is explained that cakes should be handed around first and cut afterwards, &quot;[it] sounded nonsense, but Alice obediently got up, and carried the dish around&quot;. This openness is due to her being aware that looking-glass things, such as books, work differently from normal ones.In her first encounter with the Queen of Hearts, Alice immediately chastises her for wanting to hand out a sentence before a trial was   conducted. Oppositely, in her encounter with the White Queen, Alice is aware that the former is living &quot;backwards&quot; and is willing to let her explain her logic regarding the same issue. As it has been discussed in psychology, behaviors that are considered irrational when compared to a traditional model, could be considered perfectly rational when compared to an alternative paradigm [1]; this could explain why Alice is more forgiving in LGLand.Works cited:Craig R.

Just a few faulty constructions, like &quot;As it has been discussed...&quot; which should be &quot;As has been discussed...&quot;, and &quot;once she is explained...&quot; which should be &quot;once it is explained to her...&quot;peer 2      The comparison of Alice&apos;s behavior in two stories with examples is straightforward. The theme is interesting and examples helps the understanding. May need an explanation for a terminology.peer 3      The form was good. Grammar and spelling were find (though you did have a typo when you said it would be said Looking Glass Land would be referred to as LGLand and then wrote LGLang). The paragraphs were well laid out and logical.peer 4      Nicely set out and written. Couple of spelling mistakes but not enough to be distractingCONTENT (3.0)peer 1      This is a fascinating thesis, and one that is well-supported by evidence and argument. I would have liked a little more introduction to the mirror element.peer 2      Alice&apos;s methods of entrance to the worlds are different, Alice&apos;s reaction to the inhabitants are different. The author made connection to these differences. The comparisons and the explanation of the difference are interesting. Might have been better if the author wrote the conclusion part with his/her own words.peer 3      Your thesis was interesting and well supported. You used a lot of evidence from the text without falling into the trap of unnecessary recapping. It was also nice that you went outside the text to another source to back up your argument. All around it was a very strong argument.peer 4      Your essay topic was good, and was something that I hadn&apos;t considered so fit the brief well! I thought you could have argued your point a little more though, I would have loved to hear more about itGeneral remarkspeer 2      What is &quot;mirror paradigm&quot;? I know the space is limited and there&apos;s not much room for detailed explanation, but at least needs some comment about the key term.;Hi Laura, the quotes were taken verbatim from my edition of the book (I used the free version from Amazon.com);After going back to the book I realized that you are indeed correct. The Kindle app doesn&apos;t allow copy-pasting so I must have paraphrased the bold parts by mistake, thankfully there was no change in the meaning.Thanks for that, I&apos;ll be more careful in the future.;The explanation of the grade refers to the average of form and content, not the addition. If you were talking about the total grade of each essa, the expectations are doubled.What it all means is that in the end your 7 best essays should have an average of 3.6 (an average of 1.8 in form and content) or better to receive your statement of accomplishment.;On your original question:  How to relate to a character that you find egotistic, stupid and a drama queen?A: Pity him/her;If there was any eroticism it was severely watered down in a pink-prose style;However, it was Jonathan&apos;s duty to visit the Count at the beginning of the novel due to his work.;On behalf of all of us, anal-retentive ESL speakers: you should be ashamed of your laziness. *profusely cries over his porridge*;flag it and give it double 1&apos;s I think;</string>

            <string>The links provided to us in the course syllabus have an icon that indicates it is a  &quot;Kindle download&quot; link, but I just get HTML code gibberish when I try download the Kindle version onto my Kindle Fire.Any tips for downloading from this website directly to a Kindle Fire?I also tried to download onto my computer (to perhaps transfer to the Kindle),  but it does not recognize the format.Thanks for any techie tips.   It may have been covered already (above), but honestly, I could not follow some of the technology suggestions.  Can anyone explain how to do this in simpler language?   Assume very little experience with Kindle downloads (newbie Kindle user).My goal is to get a version downloaded of each book so that I can go offline for reading time.Looking at the Kindle store for free versions - Project Guttenberg, etc.Thank you for your time and expertise.;I don&apos;t have an opinion one way or another about the videos that are intended for viewing after we&apos;ve read the assigned material, but I would really like to see all of the &quot;Before You Read&quot; videos posted immediately. I made a running start on the class and am now halfway through &quot;Dracula,&quot; so I had read &quot;Alice&quot; long before its first video was released, and of course the same will be true of &quot;Dracula.&quot;;Does anyone here have a French translation of the works handy? I&apos;d be curious to see a couple of brief excerpts of sections where there&apos;s a lot of English wordplay--perhaps some of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and another section. I had the same question about translations when I read the books. (And other people here have brought up interesting points beyond the puns that would make translation a challenge.);Very cute, Christopher! Thanks for posting it.;Mary, could you post one or two examples of those overlong essays here? Now you&apos;ve got me curious about them!;Hi, Mary. Whew, I&apos;m glad you got that figured out! Was your Android repeating the existing text of a single assignment, or displaying text from multiple essays, or what? That&apos;s an odd browser bug I&apos;ve never heard of.;Trying to make the percentages work in a single assignment would almost certainly force us to be unfair to someone. We would HAVE to give one set of 3s and we would HAVE to give one set of 1s. I&apos;m aiming for a reasonable balance of grades over all the essays I review throughout the entire course.;Martin Gardner, in the Introduction to my annotated book writes: &quot;The  fact is that Carroll&apos;s nonsense is not nearly as random and pointless as  it seems to a modern American child who tries to read the Alice books.&quot;Indeed. Remember, these books were written by a mathematician. They are not &quot;nonsense&quot; or &quot;madness&quot;; rather, they are very precise.;Frederico, you&apos;ve missed the deadline for the Grimm Bros. essay, but you have another couple of days to submit one for Lewis Carroll, so you aren&apos;t much behind schedule. Just be sure that Coursera has you in the right time zone so that the countdown timer on the Peer Responses page is correct for you.;Those of you who were lucky enough to see the National Theatre&apos;s 2011 production of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;--either live in London, or via one of the worldwide cinema broadcasts--already know what an amazing play this is. For those of you who haven&apos;t seen it, there&apos;s great news: NT Live will be providing the recording to theaters again starting October 31st. (Yes, Hallowe&apos;en!)Danny Boyle directed the play and made the brilliant casting decision to have two strong actors rotate the two lead roles. This decision ended up with an Olivier Award shared by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. If your local NT Live theater cooperates, you should have the chance to see both versions: one with BC as the Creature and JLM as Victor Frankenstein, and the other with the roles reversed.Venues for the encore screenings have not yet been announced, so bookmark this page and keep checking it:http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/16546-frankenstein And to answer your next question, no, the play is not available on DVD. :-( The NT folks have been asked about that many times, but they have always said that they did not obtain the necessary clearances for a DVD release. So do try to see it if it plays at a theater near you later this year.;Sinisa, I&apos;m not sure there is a topic about Alice that would be entirely new! But you might have a different take on a topic that someone else has mentioned. I think you should go ahead and use one of the ideas you came up with.;Hi, Samantha. This isn&apos;t a very current example, but I saw the live production of &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Jeremy Brett years ago, and it was wonderful! The sets were by Edward Gorey: all black and white except for one little spot of red in each scene. And oh yes, did they play up the sexual themes. :-) Although in a very subtle way--all innuendo, no actual nudity or anything like that.;:-) Sorry to make you feel bad about having missed the play, Andreja! It was really something...I see that Langella starred in a 1979 movie version of the story, with Laurence Olivier as van Helsing. It isn&apos;t the same production, but if you can find it, it should give you a good idea of Langella&apos;s take on Dracula.;Interesting, Catherine.I don&apos;t see any mention of garlic, wild roses, or communion wafers; perhaps Stoker added those?;It&apos;s hard for them to keep up on all the new ways of reading books, isn&apos;t it? :-)For this class, though, I imagine that only a small percentage of students are familiar with MLA and other standards, so I think we can just be very minimal in our citations, e.g. author and title. That hardly even seems necessary in the units that are comprised of a single work (as opposed to, say the Grimms&apos; &quot;Household Stories&quot;), but I saw a report from someone last week that they were not able to submit their essay for review until they put something in the Works Cited field.;Alan, I had some troubles at first with the Coursera software&apos;s word count, too. I suggest that you trim your essay a bit, paste it in again, and then see whether Coursera accepts it.FYI, I ran a test to identify the word-count differences between MS Word and Coursera, and the difference is exactly explained if Coursera is counting contractions as two words. So if you have any contractions in your essay (I had a few just from the text I quoted from &quot;Alice&quot;), they&apos;re probably putting you over 320 words in Coursera&apos;s view. Trim your essay down to about 310 MS Word words and see if that works.;Alan--I, too, and using Word for Mac and haven&apos;t had any problems with extraneous characters being added when I paste my essays into Coursera&apos;s web-based forms. But if you do have trouble, you might try saving your work as a plain-text file, then re-open that and copy and paste.Paul--Yes, you&apos;re right, I should have said &quot;contractions and possessives.&quot; Anything with apostrophe-&quot;s,&quot; Coursera seems to count as two words. As for the 1,000-word problem, I only saw that mentioned by one person, and it turned out to be a display problem with her Samsung Android phone&apos;s web browser. The submitted essays were not over the prescribed length. If you&apos;re seeing the same problem, try doing your peer reviews from a different device.;I thought Quincey shot at the bat precisely because he thought it might be the Count.As for Mina, that puzzled me, too. Didn&apos;t her own husband notice punctures on her neck??;</string>
            <string>Thank you Patricia.;Sorry, been travelling and offline (although I got Dracula finished :), I can&apos;t check my desktop for a couple of weeks now, but I&apos;m pretty sure it auto-converted to &apos;amazon native&apos; as default (not PDFs) on the right click file option and the drop-on-icon option in Mountain Lion OSX. I may be entirely wrong though, it&apos;s not unknown :) ;Thanks Patricia, unfortunately I&apos;m on a visit to Australia for a week and travelling light I only have my iPad and paperwhite. That&apos;s a good tip though for when I get back - appreciated! ;I&apos;ve only seen Spirited Away once, but now that you mention it, I do recall some similarities with the Alice stories.BTW, Christian Bale fans will definitely enjoy Howl&apos;s Moving Castle. :-);Elizabeth, the guidelines on the Peer Response pages say, &quot;Please grade the FORM of the essay you have just read on a scale of 1  to 3.  FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure.&quot; [Emphasis in the original.] So we do need to take grammar mistakes into account. Personally, I&apos;ve only been giving a &quot;1&quot; if the grammar, usage, and structure were so bad that I had difficulty understanding what the writer was trying to say. Otherwise, I make a brief mention of the errors but then give an overall satisfactory grade.;Actually, the only time in the book when Quincy Morris drops into Texas slang is when he&apos;s proposing to Lucy. As she says herself in a letter to Mina, &quot;I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn&apos;t always speak slang   that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners   but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things.&quot; In all the interactions between him and the other men, he speaks more formally.;Kerryn, the only Hawthorne and Poe stories and poems that everyone is expected to read are the ones specifically listed on the Course Syllabus page. I don&apos;t know how one should evaluate essays about stories/poems that you were not asked to read. I guess you just should hope that no one you&apos;re asked to review does that!;Aleksandra, were you trying to include a photo with your essay? I doubt that the Coursera software allows that.;</string>
            <string>Anonymous do you mean the time difference between where you are and where the University of Michigan is? You don&apos;t need to fuss with time differences. If you have your timezone set properly in Coursera, the countdown clock on the assignments page will be accurate for your location.;You&apos;re right, Maitane, there&apos;s no excuse for people to be rude, or to mark you down for usage errors in the Content section of the grading form. I think most of us are trying to &quot;give a little slack&quot; to peers who seem not to have English as a primary language.;Martin, have you tried adding line breaks manually within the Coursera page? That would at least solve the immediate problem until you can figure out why your word-processing software is using line-break characters that Coursera doesn&apos;t understand--or maybe why your browser isn&apos;t retaining line breaks when you paste the text.;Dioni, are you asking whether the text of the novel itself changed? My understanding of Prof. Rabkin&apos;s video was that there are two different introductions, but I&apos;m not aware that Shelley changed any of the text.;If a reviewer really did say &quot;Your comma crazy,&quot; then s/he should be spending more time learning the difference between &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&apos;re&quot; and less time fussing about your alleged overuse of commas. :-);I suppose this doesn&apos;t quite qualify since it has only played in theaters at certain times and isn&apos;t available on DVD, but Danny Boyle&apos;s National Theatre production of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was outstanding. I hope to see it again this fall when it&apos;s broadcast to theaters again.;Interesting theory, Sean! I wonder whether anyone ever asked Steinbeck about that...I haven&apos;t seen the Meredith/Chaney version of OMaM (hah! Lon Chaney playing the &quot;monster&quot; again!), but I have seen the Sinise/Malkovich version. I&apos;m convinced that Sinise was born to direct and act in Steinbeck&apos;s stories; it&apos;s an excellent film. (He also did a wonderful &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; for PBS years ago.);Rhona, is there any library near you that can get it for you?;Hi, Francine. 320 words is definitely a challenge, but as you&apos;ve probably seen from reading other people&apos;s essays, it&apos;s entirely possible to address a specific topic in that number of words. You just need to focus on something that can be discussed in 3-4 paragraphs.600-word essays would be much harder for us to review. :-);Ana, I&apos;m not aware of any way to turn in an essay late. With tens of thousands of students in each course, Coursera really has to have firm deadlines to keep classes on schedule. But if you&apos;ve done all the other essays so far, you&apos;re fine, because you only need to do 7 out of 10 essays to get a certificate of completion. (Assuming that you get passing grades on those 7.) You could post your essay for other students to enjoy if you like!;I hope that listening to Poe doesn&apos;t scare you just when you need your sleep to recover! :-) If you&apos;ve done all the other essays then you&apos;re still fine. I hope you feel better soon!;:-) He&apos;s a cutie! Portuguese water dog?;In honor of his 130th birthday. Too bad he isn&apos;t around to see it, because it&apos;s very cute. Should be up until 9:00 p.m. PDT (U.S. West Coast time) Wednesday night. I just checked a number of other countries and they&apos;ve got it, too. But some don&apos;t, so if your country&apos;s Google home page doesn&apos;t have it, check some other countries.;Wow, Anna, that was great synchronicity!Yes, the interactive doodles are a lot of fun. But this one was nicely done.;</string>
            <string>Nopes, the button isn&apos;t there at all...weird, huh?:/;Certainly the people we will first send to Mars will be well behaved. What comes 50 or 100 years after that, I&apos;m not so sure...;Adriana, that other thread you posted in said that photos were required for people taking a class via Signature Track. Are you doing that? There&apos;s no &quot;Signature Track&quot; label next to your name on your postings. If not, then you don&apos;t need a photo to pass the class.;Dorothy, are you using a lot of contractions or possessives? My word counts have usually only differed by 4 or 5 between Word and Coursera. 20-30 is a lot.I&apos;m surprised that Coursera is maintaining superscript formatting. I would expect it to make them regular numbers.;Okay, that&apos;s interesting about superscripts. Yeah, if you&apos;re checking it with the &quot;Review your work&quot; link and it looks fine there, then that should be exactly what peer reviewers see.;I read somewhere that the software will take up to 10% over the word count. My current essay is 329 words and was accepted okay.I haven&apos;t seen word counts when reviewing other people&apos;s essays.;Out of curiosity, Catherine, what did your own text editor&apos;s word count show?;Funny you should say that, Anna--those are the two stories I chose for my Unit 5 essay. :-);&quot;I think, from now on, instead of picking apart the stories, I&apos;ll just focus on their writing style.&quot;Writing style is a perfectly valid aspect to analyze. If people think they have to psychoanalyze the characters or something like that, they&apos;re misunderstanding what&apos;s required for a short college-level essay.;&quot; I agree that the darkness, rainfall and dreary cold weather during the  Swiss holiday set a mood that most likely influenced the tone and  scenery of the novel.&quot; In fact, the contest among the writers was specifically to create a horror story, right? So they were all writing stories with a similar mood.;Ana, there&apos;s an interactive doodle on Google.com today, if you can get to that site. It&apos;s a series of postcards from a family trip across the United States, in honor of Independence Day.;Bonjour, Kathleen. I just got a similar comment on my &quot;Frankenstein&quot; essay: &quot;Your analysis is very interesting. However, I do think you could have  been even further in your argument by using outside sources. So, for  next time, I would like to encourage you to cite works in your paper.&quot; I have enough trouble getting my thoughts on a book trimmed down to 320 words as it is; trying to add in citations about the book from another source would have me tearing out my hair! I expect that your 30-page thesis had plenty of citations, but a 320-word essay???;&quot;Anonymous,&quot; I&apos;m talking about--and I&apos;m pretty sure that Kathleen is talking about--citations of OTHER sources. Some reviewers have suggested that we should read and refer to writings other than the book itself. For example, in the case of &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; these reviewers might have wanted to see citations from essays about the hubris of science, or the effects of cold parents on their children, or some other analysis of the story. ;Dolor sit amet!:-)Are you getting low grades, or the comments are annoying, or...??;300,000?? Good heavens, what course was that?;The only Hawthorne stories required for the course are the ones you listed. Don&apos;t forget the required Poe readings, too!;Beautiful! Thank you for the pointer, Vivian.There&apos;s a slideshow of the garden (and also stock photos and information of the individual plants) on the NYBG website:http://www.nybg.org/wildmedicine/index.html;Olga, I don&apos;t know what rubricating is, but it sounds like you&apos;re having trouble with the formatting. If it&apos;s something easy like line breaks, just add them manually after you paste in your essay. If it&apos;s something more complicated, maybe you could try a different text editor to generate the text.I notice that your apostrophes in your message above are the same as opening single quotes instead of closing single quotes, so if you pasted that message in from a text editor, that editor is definitely having compatibility problems with Coursera&apos;s software. Or maybe your web browser is making changes to the text on its way in. Either way, I suggest you experiment with different software.;Hi, Olga. &quot;Rubricating&quot; may be exactly the right word; I&apos;m not familiar with a lot of academic terminology. :-)I use Word myself and have no trouble copying and pasting. But I&apos;ve read comments from other people who do have trouble. So maybe you should try a different web browser? Also, do you use the Preview option after you&apos;ve pasted in your text? That should show you exactly how it will look to reviewers.;Olga, I completely understand your reading the assigned texts in your native language. However, when it comes time to write your essays, you do need to back up your thesis with details from the book, so those need to be in English. Once you&apos;ve read the material in your own language (Russian?), you know the book and should be able to quickly find the sections you need for your essay in the English versions.;Dorothy, where does it say that we have to provide a counterargument??? All of my essays have only supported my thesis.;Interesting. I have enough trouble fitting a couple pieces of evidence for my argument into 320 words, much less adding a counterargument! So I think I&apos;ll stick with the simpler form. :-);Anonymous 1, I have encountered many essays that appear to be from non-native English speakers. However, all the ones I&apos;ve gotten have had generally good English, so I&apos;ve given them &quot;2&quot; for form and mentioned that the person&apos;s English is very good for someone who appears not to be a native speaker. If it were really bad, I guess I&apos;d have to give a 1, but fortunately that hasn&apos;t happened het.Dominick, do you think that assignment was unintelligible because the person really didn&apos;t have good ideas, or because they were struggling to express their ideas in English? I know it can be hard to tell, but when it&apos;s the latter, I give them a good grade. As for being one block of text, folks should be using the Preview function to make sure that their text has kept its formatting when pasted into Coursera&apos;s web forms.;Okay, then yeah, that would have to get a 1 on Form and maybe also on Content. Too bad.;Byurakn, it sounds to me as though your grading was appropriate. The essay was supposed to be about at least one of the specified stories; if they didn&apos;t do that, they failed the assignment.;Anonymous 1, there is a tiny little link called &quot;flag&quot; at the bottom right of the essay. You can use that to report inappropriate submissions. I think you can go back and do that even if you&apos;ve already submitted grades for that essay.;</string>
            <string>Megan, why would you waste your time reading two stories that were not assigned? That part of the essay failed. If the writer did a good job on the Hawthorne part of the essay, I suppose you could still give it a passing grade, but it&apos;s a toss-up, since the person didn&apos;t follow the requirements of this unit.;Yes! Read the Work Expectations page:http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html ;James, when you say, &quot;I was only shown one of my peer reviewers comments and evaluations,&quot; that kind of sounds like there were more comments that you weren&apos;t shown. I doubt that&apos;s the case. It&apos;s much more likely that the other reviewers simply didn&apos;t make any comments.;James, yes, that&apos;s what I meant: apparently only peer 3 made any comments in those sections.In the final section, peer 2 also commented. Peer 1 didn&apos;t make comments in any section.;Never occurred to me, but it wouldn&apos;t hurt, I suppose.;As it happened, I discussed one Hawthorne story and one Poe story in my essay, but my understanding that I could have just written about one author (or even one story). I can see how that reviewer might have thought otherwise, though. Just one of the pitfalls of peer reviews, I&apos;m afraid; the people giving you grades may not quite understand the grading criteria.;What I found amusing about &quot;The Star&quot; is that once again, Wells is correct about Neptune being the outermost planet. :-);</string>

Hoping a study group will keep me motivated!;So... Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad (sorry - California), Mumbai and New Delhi. Nice. Exactly how are we planning to connect? I&apos;m not very familiar with either Coursera or study groups, so please do let me know. Thanks.And just btw, how come I haven&apos;t seen you guys on the other discussion forums?;</string>

But then I left. Got bored, (fortunately).So, you too, huh? And are you following that &apos;lump of Gold&apos; thread? Its hilarious and very valid at the same time!

Very insightful comments all over the place, if you ask me.;Very lucky of me, more like. That was two years ago, (I&apos;m 20) and I&apos;m now working as a scriptwriter, concept artist and production supervisor for a media production house. Its an extremely lively industry and you get to meet all sorts of people (which is both good and bad) and it keeps you up and running, both physically and mentally, 24X7, so I&apos;m not complaining. I&apos;m pursuing multiple grads at the moment, one Mass-Com and the other English, so the parents aren&apos;t complaining either.A Law student looking for a non-Law job. This is the second reason I left. :P    How about doing something in political science or going for the Civils? Your law background should give you an edge in either one. Either that, or a job involving corporate law, which would get you work regarding corporate strategies and policies, but none of that boring filing work. Just a suggestion.And yeah, hats off to Greg. He&apos;s a right sort of debater too, if you&apos;re following our little argument about the splat.I&apos;ve yet to finish the Grimms.

So... what about everyone else?;Also, thanks for the suggestions. Will have a look.;No problem. And I apologise for the loquaciousness - haven&apos;t had any intelligent conversation in quite a while. One of the drawbacks of being a supervisor in the media.;Thanks for bringing this up. I&apos;m using another version too and I&apos;ll check it against the link.I also noticed that &apos;Cinderella&apos; is &apos;Aschenputtel&apos; in the Grimm brothers&apos; books. As Faith put it, It must be a translation thing.  ;</string>
            <string>Sarah from Mumbai, India;As Karen has noted, it makes perfect sense. Fantasy tales in general are extremely rigid when it comes to social structures playing a part in what trials and tribulations a hero (or heroine) faces.  Another point. Its not just luck. Anyone noticed that heroes of low birth have their virtues, skills and values taught to them, while the &apos;nobler&apos; ones seem to already have a predisposition for them?  And whenever we see that our hero happens to be a very fast learner, (I&apos;m looking at you, Paolini) or has exceptionally strong values and character, surprise! He had noble blood all along, and now it makes perfect sense.  There are exceptions of course, but thats the general trend. I do realise I strayed from your point a little, but this tendency seems to crop up everywhere, not just in the Grimms. It seems our ancestors were very taken with genetics.  Possible causes according to me: 1. During the times the stories came up, Kings and nobles were seen as having a &apos;divine&apos; right to rule, and were seen as &apos;superior&apos; in terms of blood. A boy with amazing luck/virtue would be more believable if he were of noble blood. 2. Tales would be passed on to the nobles, who would obviously want to be seen as the good guys. The convention gets encouraged.  Uhmmm... Any other possible reasons?;Hi, People of Madrid  I think it could be a nice idea to meet us to direct peer-review and also to help to those that, as me, have big-ogre problems with the English.

Hope we all learn well together.;Also the idea of storing or concealing the pot of fat in the church and thinking nobody would steal it from there. I think it talks about the pious and sacredness of a holy place and also talks about the conscience..  ;Or can we put it this way.. The care that has to be taken in choosing people who will around us all the time. That could be a lesson for the reader about what is going to happen if the friendships are not proper. The insult the master had to face just because of trusting Grethel blindly and being in a bad company.. Thoughts please..;Perfect.. Tom and Jerry they are... Loved your comparison with Animal Farm.. They could be pretend to be close to serve the situation, but can never be friends..:);This tale speaks a lot about the faith and the need of people, who hold lead positions having faithful people. In this tale the loyalty shown by John to his king was remarkable because he gave up his life for that. And the foresight of king about John&apos;s loyalty speaks about &quot;experience of a person sharpens his ability of judging people&quot;. And the young price can be taken for those who take decisions just by instincts and not a thorough thought process. The raven&apos;s warnings to the help received before going to do something impossible. Why raven..? May be because they tend to travel all sought of places and have a facility of watching everything that happens from above. Young King&apos;s anger on John shows his love and protection for his wife above anything in this world. But when he sacrifices his children for John, we can infer that he is now a matured leader who could sacrifice his own children for the sake of his subjects. And he putting his queen for test about the children, I think talks about his conscience. When the queen turns up saying the same thing he is relieved. And they lived happily ever after. So it speaks about leadership, faith, loyalty, and family. This is my understanding.. Thoughts please..   ;Cutting the heads of children I think could not have been obvious. I feel, the children being the allegory of the most loving and desirable thing of one&apos;s life and cutting their heads is an allegory of sacrificing that most desirable thing . And when it comes to leadership, the leader should be able to sacrifice anything for his followers whatever it is. And to scare people from doing evil and give a picture about tough situations of life, I think the writer could have used such horrible example.. This my thought.. Please share yours.;Or may be they could have predicted the most horrible things that are going to happen in the future.( As we are seeing these days). We came across a little boy killing his fellow students and many such incidents. So i presume they could be predictions of horrible things that going to happen and good thing is that they also spoke about the lesson people are going to learn after being evil. My thought...;Generally when it comes to rain, it is considered for merry and a sign of happiness and is always awaited. But here in this tale, Rain is implied for grief. If rain is to be compared to weeping what else in this world could be a greater grief. Expressing the highest degree of misery and grief. In love with this expression. Please share your thoughts..;Thank you for the response. I totally agree with your point of winter being sad and gloomy. Coming to my point of thought, Yes, farmers are the once who welcome rain. But the reason for that is &quot;If it rains they are going to have proper farming and in turn produce food grains&quot;. Production of food grains is merry to everyone. So, I thought everyone would welcome rain with joy. Please share.;As per my understanding, I couldn&apos;t find Alice&apos;s age at least in beginning chapters. I am sure this would help in analyzing. As the thoughts of children differ and depend on the age. Thoughts please...;I felt the conversation between the caterpillar and Alice was much like a conversation between a manager and his employee. :) Please share thoughts.;</string>
            <string>Hey there, Sunil. Welcome to Coursera.;Ashutosh from Pune. Nice meeting you all.;Hi both of you. It&apos;s generally  very  refreshing to see people from engineering and science backgrounds who love literature.  ;</string>
            <string>I almost forgot!Nandini - thanks for starting this forum. :);</string>
            <string>Frederico, if you go into a forum, do you not see a &quot;Start new thread&quot; button? It should be right next to the &quot;All Threads&quot; title.;This is all I see...I only see &quot;All Threads&quot;, nothing more.;You have to choose a sub-forum first - e.g. General. then you should see an option to start a new one. ;Thanks, I was wondering about the specific tales too! I think perhaps it would be &quot;safer&quot; to try and make a connection between one of Poe&apos;s stories and one of Hawthorne&apos;s...I don&apos;t know. On the other hand, Poe has some recorrent elements in his writting, so maybe it would be better to focus on them?;Reading Do androids dream of electric sheep, written by Phillip K. Dick, or watching Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, I noticed the constant subject of eyes and vision in the story. The test to tell humans from replicants, the strange glow in the eyes of the replicants, the way Pris paints her eyes, the glasses of Tyrrell, the way he dies at the hands of Roy, the asian eye manufacturer and so on.It reminded of what Prof. Rabkin said about the symbolism of eyes, as pathways to our souls and so forth. I think it&apos; perhaps the sci-fi work in which this symbolism is most evident and now I wonder if other works follow this same trend. And I also wonder what each particular eye reference means in the book/movie.;That&apos;s true. By the way, that&apos;s one book series that still hasn&apos;t got a really good adaptation for cinema and TV yet.;I believe the origami simply indicates that they knew about Deckard&apos;s dreams and memories....exactly the way Deckard knew about Rachel&apos;s, what make Deckard a replicant as well. Why they wanted Deckard to know he was a replicant? I suppose it was a sort of &quot;farewell gift&quot;, a present from a job well done...after all, Deckard and Rachel didn&apos;t have much time left, so knowing that they are both replicants and being left alone with whatever time they had left was all they (&quot;they&quot; here being the police) could do to thank him for catching the other replicants.;I ask this because I only got Hawthorne&apos;s essays for peer evaluation. Now I wonder if i did something silly and it was only about Hawthorne (I wrote about Poe)...;Phew, that&apos;s a relief! Thanks, guys!;It&apos;s funny, because I thought Poe would be most student&apos;s choice, since he is - I think - more famous and cited than Hawthorne. It came as a big surprise to me to get no Poe&apos;s essays at all...and yes, &quot;The Birthmark&quot; seems to be the most reviewed story in this unit. I wonder why. It&apos;s sad for me, because I have been a Poe fan since my teens and I really wanted to engage in more discussions about him.;Agreed.;</string>
            <string>The last one? Ha-ha! Sorry, but I just did not enjoy them. I&apos;d never read them before, although of course, I knew many of the stories, I had a mental image of Grimm stories being &quot;dark&quot;, but after reading this selection I have to say that I did not enjoy them. I didn&apos;t like the repetition; or the fact that base, mean, selfish, duplicitous, conniving people/things/objects often won the day; I hated the inconsistency - why is it that animals, even needles can be animate and talk, but in Tom Thumb when an animal &quot;speaks&quot; they know it&apos;s something weird and out of the ordinary; why is every step-mother evil; why didn&apos;t Cinderella&apos;s (Aschcenputiel) father step up/speak out for her? I could go on, but clearly, I&apos;m ranting. I am hoping that this class and my wonderful classmates can help me appreciate this!;</string>
            <string>Wow I never thought of it that way- I didn&apos;t hear about the Grimm stories till I was older. I definitely agree that we all need to be aware of a story&apos;s power because just like a lie it can have unforeseen consequences.;My dad read these   Grimms&apos; tales at bedtime (it&apos;s funny - I had a difficult time reading these tales to my daughter because they are frightful   Things do change after 20 years).   My book at the time had no illustrations - it was up to me to picture the scenario in my mind.   It&apos;s hard to choose a favorite, isn&apos;t it?   Tom Thumb.   The Frog Prince, The Bremen Town Musicians, The Fisherman and his Wife, Hansel and Gretel, Little Brother and Little Sister...   My dad imparted a very important rule to me when I was younger:   always be nice to the little old lady.And as for Ms. O&apos;Hara - you bring up important thoughts.   Maybe some of the themes you mention reflect the culture of the time? Not the animals or inanimate objects, but even the base, mean, selfish, etc. people who win the day - doesn&apos;t that happen today albeit differently?   And many children do see their stepmothers as evil - even if that&apos;s not the reality.   I don&apos;t know enough of the thought process that went into the creation of these stories.   Perhaps the authors were speaking from a child&apos;s imagination in how the kids interpret the introduction of a new woman who captures their father&apos;s time as threatening.   Or a jealous woman who acts out.   But again, I have no idea.   Just thinking out loud.;</string>

            <string>If for example you are writing about Little Red Cap, you would be expected to have a look at Little Red Riding Wood by Charles Perrault and Freud&apos;s Psychoanalysis on this particular tale. Then, of course, you would need to confront your point to theirs  or support your ideas thanks to their arguments. So, you would need to include them in your references.;I live abroad. My mum brought me my pretty old copy of Alice in Wonderland and Through the looking glass in French during her stay a few months ago before I even  knew about  the course... The illustrations are from Dusan Kallay.  My mother  brought  the book  for me to read to my children along with the complete work of Charles Perrault, the 1001 nights, and many more tales I used to keep under my bed and read and re-read and re-read, and re-rea... Alice is the only book I have not read 20 times at least because I was never that hooked by it.   I am now re-reading it and thinking... Wow, how amazing that this book  was written in 1865...;Hi Ma Del Mar Palma Gonzalez... I am Anonymous 1, but you can call me Manue....  and I can&apos;t stop giggling after reading your first sentence... :)  I think I am going to follow Anonymous 2&apos;s insight... Applying the percentage technique on 5 essays does not work for me. But thanks for responding to my post, I appreciate... it might help someone else.;;) Actually, I like your name, I think you should keep it that way.  It fits this course perfectly, carrying its own story and colorful pictures...;Thanks a lot Florencia. Actually, I have no problem calculating the percentage.What I am saying is that out of 5 papers, it is only chance that will allow you to grade in a fair way and  at the same time end up with the same percentage announced by the professor.  To be sure to end up with such a percentage and at the same time grade in a fair way,  you need a lot of copies to correct. At least this is what I understand from the laws of probability. This is why, after thought, I ended up concluding for myself that you need to grade fairly without sticking too much to the percentage if you start with only 5 copies...Anyone specialist in probabilities out there?!;I guess you did an analysis on the Almond Tree...;Hope this will help... Now, I would like to suggest you to just trust yourself. Really, I mean it. Trust that you have something to bring up. Constructive feedback is not only about pointing out mistakes but also about saying what you enjoyed reading, what you found interesting. Also do not hesitate to say if you thought one point was not clear enough. FORM:peer 1     Your first paragraph was constructed well, but from the second sentence onward the structure isn&apos;t quite there. Watch for repetitive use of &quot;The&quot; as a sentence starter, and try to move away from to-be verbs (is/was/are) in favor of stronger, more specific verbs, like &quot;contains&quot;, &quot;represents&quot;, &quot;interweaves&quot;, etc. Some sentences are worded in a way that the meaning is unclear, such as &quot;A group introduces anonymity.&quot; and &quot;This idea is present in all religions of the book.&quot; I think I understand what you mean, but I&apos;m not certain. peer 3     A well written and structured essay. I like the fact that you have a closing paragraph and would have liked to see more of an opening one, perhaps the sentences regarding the symbolism with the ants and the bees could have been moved to a new paragraph and that first sentence could have been followed with another introductory sentence, because it&apos;s currently a somewhat cold open, we jump right in to a list of symbolic elements without much explanation. This is also apparent in the third paragraph in which you&apos;ve simply mentioned the main lesson of the story but there isn&apos;t much explanation regarding it, everything is presented in a very sudden manner. The grammar is great, though it could do with a slight edit as I feel some words were left out while you were typing. All in all, a very well written essay,CONTENT:peer 1     This essays feels very unfocused to me. You mention symbols of fertility, the importance of the number three, group dynamics, and the Commandment against killing. I see that you tried to tie them all together in your closing statement, but with so many themes it is difficult to explore each one deeply enough for the last sentence to resonate with the reader. I would suggest picking one theme and dedicating a full essay to it rather than try to cover everything that stood out to you.  peer 3     I&apos;ll be honest with you, reviewing this particular essay has been very hard for me. On the one hand, I love the observations that you&apos;ve made, it&apos;s obvious you&apos;ve deeply analyzed the story, and yet on the other hand I feel like I am being bombarded with on the surface observations and not a lot of explanation and analysis. I have a feeling this is due to the word limit the essay has, but even so, you could have picked one of the issues you&apos;ve raised and delved deeper into it or you could have removed the last two lines of the second paragraph (the part about the number 3 and groups) and used that space to elaborate on your closing paragraph a bit more. The way it currently stands, you have decided to analyze everything in the story and because of the word limit, you&apos;ve only been able to mostly list those things, and while the issues you&apos;ve listed are extremely fascinating and enriching, they would have been even more enriching had you picked a specific aspect and analyzed that deeply. However, you have a great analytical mind, very good job.;Thanks for the share, it made me smile!  ;</string>
            <string>I am pretty sure that overall, the final grade for nearly each one of us will be very fair. Here is my personal experience in another course if that can motivate some of you out there... In The Modern and Postmodern class I felt I had been downgraded at least once and did not even get a single comment justifying that. Another time, I got a very high grade and only spent minutes on my essay because I had no time to work on it. I thought... This is crazy!   Then,  I re-read all my essays and compared what I wrote in the beginning of the course and what I wrote last... I considered the possibility that the  paper was actually  fine and concluded that it was more accurate to say that after a few weeks of training I was able to write an essay in a rush! Overall,  the average  grade I thought I  would get was  pretty fair in my opinion.  I was very surprised to  obtain a  100/100 on my certificate! I understood that I got that grade  because I handed over more essays than required. We might not get the chance to do so in that course, however,  I would like to advise you not hesitate to over exceed expectations, you might get well rewarded... if not with a higher grade, at least with an interesting rewiring of your brain! Here is my blog about my learning experience if you have time to have a look at it... www.emmanuellemoukarzel.blogspot.com;Oups... Experienced some issues with my blog right after posting the link... Sorry... Hopefully it is now fixed. Did you find some mistakes? Did some links not work? Did some pics failed to show? Any constructive feedback would be greatly greatly appreciated!

But I will definitely do my best to keep on posting some material...  Any suggestions are welcome!;I agree Anonymous. Personally I tend to make this remark when grading: if you need to use &quot;I&quot;, do so only in your conclusion when it is &quot;ok&quot; to entirely write from you point of view. However, avoiding &quot;I&quot; is recommended in academical papers (including no personal experiences or self directed scientific experiences).  ;I enrolled in both classes. However, I am moving countries in two weeks... I have so much to do before and while and after I move!... I am also taking a third course. So, I had to make a decision... I will quit &quot;The Fiction of Relationship&quot;. I believe it will come up again in the future anyway.  All the best to the ones following both courses!!;</string>

            <string>Hello,I referred to the course syllabus and wrote a paper on the Masque of the Red Death. I felt I had done really great this time. But, one peer gave me the minimum of points because he said, this story was &quot;not part of the unit&quot;??? Ok, this story was not in the lesson, but it was part of the syllabus thus.  But... Really??? Was I not allowed to choose this story for my essay?What were we supposed to read or not to read?Thanks...  ;Thank you for your responses Daniel, I appreciate. Yes, well, I tripled checked too. I have to say I made a distinction between what the professor was going to analyse in his lesson and what we could write about. But, it does say &quot;the specific readings are&quot;, so... I will have to read more slowly next time, and if I hesitate next time, I will go on the safe side! Never mind thus! I feel I wrote a very original and outstanding essay, at least compared to my previous work (I understood this opinion was even shared by the peer who heavily downgraded me :)... No regrets!Best of luck to you in this course Daniel.  ;We learned the hard way!  ;Sure William, you can find it here:http://emmanuellemoukarzel.blogspot.com/p/after-all-i-learned-on-coursera-i.htmlWent and checked your blog &quot;graphomania&quot; (I would have like to read your essays too.);Florencia, you can find my essay on my blog:  http://emmanuellemoukarzel.blogspot.com/p/after-all-i-learned-on-coursera-i.htmlLast week I moved to another country of residence, so I was in a hurry!

            <string>The criticism that fairy tales lack logic is  particularly  interesting because they aren&apos;t meant to be logical if you equate logic with an accurate reflection of reality. I would disagree that the simplistic nature of the fairy tell reflects the time period because the idea of proposing on love at first sight is as  preposterous  as it is today, perhaps even more so because economics and alliance play less of a role in marriage.  I recommend Bruno Bettelheim&apos;s  The Uses of Enchantment  to anyone interested in a Freudian interpretation of fairy tales. It in part explains the simplistic nature of fairy tales through their connection to children. The children&apos;s sense of morality is different than ours and the endings we see as cruel or harsh actually have a sense of justice to them. On the other hand, evil sometimes wins and fairy tales introduce the notion that &quot;life isn&apos;t fair&quot; in a story that is short and more easily digested.  Anyways, I enjoy the stories for what they are, but I agree that they cannot be enjoyed if you do not realize that they are simplified, not because times were more simple, but because the stories are more symbolic and akin to Aesop&apos;s fables.  ;are we supposed to read all the stories from the gutenberg ebook?  ;Lauren, me too and Voyager is my Fave. I actually am even on the Bring Back Captain Janeway group on Facebook that campeigned for Janeway&apos;s return in the novels. It worked. :)  That aside, even the Voyager naysayers cannot deny that it was the lost innovative of the Treks since the original series with its ship designs, alien species, and planets.  As with anything Trek, Voyager was ahead if its time. If it were released a decade later, the female captain thing wouldn&apos;t be an issue...or as much as one, I stil meet backwards- thinking individuals who say a female captain is wrong and that hate Janeway because she&apos;s a female captain or they the Mulgrew, etc. Sad. ;Disclaimer: I came into Who during the Tennant years, which in some Old Who circles makes anything I say about Who instantly invalid. ;)However, I&apos;m a huge Douglas Adams fan, and one of the things I love about Who is the slight camp nature of it (though, sadly, that seems to be falling by the wayside in the Moffat era of MORE SFX!)... so I immediately went back and devoured everything I could get my hands on, starting with Pirate Planet and then watching in order from the beginning. And I found things to love in every Doctor and almost every script. That experience leads me to believe two things:1. Old Whovians who complain so bitterly about New Who have a fundamentally different view of the show (perhaps colored by nostalgia) than someone who came into New Who and goes back to look at everything in Old Who as objectively as possible.2. New Whovians don&apos;t go back and look at Old Who nearly often enough (which probably feeds the animosity between the two groups - as a long time Beatles fan, I know the huge influx of Anthology fans *often* drove me mad with what I saw as stunning ignorance of everything that came before the Anthology, the importance of the Anthology to those of us who had been waiting for it for decades, damn kids get off my lawn, etc. I&apos;ve been there).If there is any Doctor who fits less into the mold of &quot;The Doctor&quot; for *me*, it&apos;s Eleven... I find him to be disturbingly morally *ambiguous* (as opposed to &quot;morally following a different code to humans&quot;) in a way none of the others have quite been. That&apos;s not a criticism of Matt Smith as much as the actual writing of Eleven - he&apos;s written in a more mercurial, more unpredictable way than any of his predecessors, to my eyes. But plenty of Old Whovians tell me I&apos;m wrong and he reminds them of Troughton - I see what they mean, but I interpret it differently. A chacun son go  t!;Considering that this is a sci-fi and fantasy class, and therefore there are some literature buffs amongst us, I would also recommend: &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot; (Season 3, Episode 2, Tennant). It has a very different flavor to the ones above, more fantastical with a little bit of history (and, of course, a little sci-fi). There&apos;s also some great stuff about the power of words.Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love all of the episodes above, but all but one were written by Steven Moffat, and there are many other talented writers in the Whoniverse.Edit: Oh, and lovers of steampunk, the episode you want is called &quot;The Next Doctor.&quot; ;If you have any more specific questions, let me know.

            <string>I agree, but scarely, dystopians have far more truth in them than utopias.     For example, 1984.   When Orwell wrote that book, it was almost purely fantasy, science fiction.   But, now many of things he mentions in that novel exist today.   The idea of being watched at all times (Snowden anyone).     Any other dystopian future, Brave New World, Gattaca, Slaughterhouse 5, A Handmaid&apos;s Tale, Hunger Games, etc.     They are by far fantasy--they deal with unreal places that only exist in imagination--but they are grounded in the realities of the world within which they are written.   And scarily, many have been amazingly prescient.;I don&apos;t think its that his books are too long, I think it mind be the fact that what I know of his books they are more in the genre of &quot;adventure.&quot;  I feel that this course is more about works that muse on the human condition than to live whole-heartedly within in, which Verne&apos;s books do well.;Harker&apos;s get-away occurs &quot;off stage,&quot; but the reader does see his mental preparations after he climbs into Dracula&apos;s chambers and attacks him with the shovel. I&apos;m sure it involved a lot of climbing and theft from that pile of gold that was gathering dust.  ;Wow. Never read that particular poem. We all know that Plath was not happy with the world of dreams, and embraced the darkness &quot;meaning to last it out...&quot; (see &quot;Lady Lazarus&quot;), whereas Carroll wanted to sooth his troubled mind with the comfort of fantasy, wordplay, and logic. Thanks for sharing! I&apos;m going to add that to my poem bank for teaching!;Three words:  Brave New World.  Why the hell don&apos;t we have feelies yet?;I felt a little odd with all the death talk in the lecture videos. I rather saw it as the scariness of life, and how it doesn&apos;t quite make sense after all the things we do to complicate it. Am I alone?;It&apos;s a &quot;knight&quot; going out to brave the wilds and fight the Jabberwocky and bring its head home as a prize.;We are the people of this &quot;modern world&quot; bringing our views to the books that we read throughout this course. Books are not passive experiences, yet allow the reader to interact with them. Shakespeare is old, but in Huxley&apos;s  Brave New World (written in the 1930s) there is new life brought to Shakespeare&apos;s words when the protagonist finally has the life experiences that motivated the characters and events in  Othello and  The Tempest. Huxley&apos;s words ring true today, though they aren&apos;t too far from being a century old. Though Grimm is &quot;ancient&quot; and Bradbury &quot;old news&quot; in our class&apos;s genres, they still have themes worth discussing and exploring.There are bound to be a lot of omissions from the &quot;relevant&quot; list of Fantasy and Sci-Fi novels, but much of this list has seen the test of time. I would never have picked up  Alice  on my own, and though it&apos;s not a favorite, I have a newer way of looking at the world now.;So for &quot;Dr. Heidigger...&quot; and Poe, I&apos;m thinking drink recipes... :)I&apos;ll have have to see if I can think up some baked goods/recipes to share.;If you&apos;re into looking at the Global machine of Disney, I&apos;d suggest viewing &quot;Mickey Mouse Monopoly&quot; or reading The Mouse that Roared. Disney uses fairy tales much in the way that Grimm does: to reinforce social values and morality. The video is particularly enlightening on the subject of the way Disney depicts women in different eras.One of the Disney films that would be a particularly good study for this of recent years is &quot;The Princess and the Frog.&quot; It&apos;s one of the last traditionally animated films, and was largely swept under the rug by the &quot;princess&quot; movie  Tangled.;Hawthorne has some redeeming qualities, but Poe. Man, I&apos;m an English teacher who&apos;d divorce her husband in a hot minute for him if he were to be reborn. I have a thing for the sensitive, fragile ones.  Oh, the feels!;Hmm. Since when was being a paragon of Christian morality a requirement of romantic worthiness? To each his or her own. I merely prefer his unabashed exploration of his passion and his nightmares in fiction.  Also, was he a destructive alcoholic? Yes, to himself mostly. And to his finances at different points in his life. But with a relative that is trying to struggle with nearly 40 years of unchecked alcoholism, I know that it is a disease and not merely a sin of gluttonous proportions. I still love this family member.  I&apos;m not going to even touch on the 13 year old bride. Jerry Lee Lewis suffered for this as much as Poe has to certain critics. I guess I just have to settle with the fact I&apos;d not be his type. ;Also, a list of personal pain for Poe:-Birth father absent from his life.-Birth mother died.-Adopted. Yay!-Adoptive mother diess.-Adoptive father rejects him and leaves him penniless.-Finds love. Yay!-She dies.I&apos;d probably be abusing something too.  Ha(w)thorne:-Ancestor condemned &quot;witches&quot; to death.-Life of moderate comfort and support.-Friends with some of the great minds of his era.Kudos to you, Nate! Still a didact--but then again so is  The Crucible&apos;s  Arthur Miller. And I still can appreciate his work...;Just read all of the Poe stories indicated by Prof. Rabkin, they are truly Poe&apos;s heavy hitters, including the detective story that is said to have sparked a thousand literary sleuths. Big things with Poe are unreliable narrator, the power of human imagination/the mind, and the perversesness that humans are capable of.;i also agree that cult of personality may be more appropriate here than Renfield having been bit. And we try can&apos;t try to make any assumption that Renfield was completely sane or insane before this all happened. He is most importantly a plot device. Thanks for pointing out the pattern with his zoophagus behavior! That made me laugh.;It was written in VIctorian England. People who did not want to refer to chicken by &quot;breast&quot; and &apos;thigh,&quot; therefore the terms &quot;white meat&quot; and &quot;dark meat&quot; arose. Of course it&apos;s watered down.;Stick with me here, as I have to build upon a little bit of back story. Dracula&apos;s main object of sexual attention is Lucy when he comes to England. Lucy has just recently been won by Arthur, leaving two other men thwarted in their heterosexual desires. But Dracula usurps Arthur and the others in their desires, snatching Lucy away. After she is corrupted, they have no choice but to kill her and free her soul. By doing this, the men are left only with their friendship and unity over love for Lucy. There is an intense bond between these men, which seems to be typical of male friendships in the 19th century as depicted in literature. They use this bond as strength against Dracula, often not bothering to consult Mina, as Prof. Rabkin notes in his video lectures, which is exactly how they begin to lose her. Mina is the paragon of proper womanhood and wifeliness, all something the men would love to have, but the hypersexual Count once again steals this away from them, thwarting proper homosexual relations and the progeny that could spring from it. Heterosexual sex, biblically and functionally (especially in the Victorian era) was for having children only. Yet this was a period in history when women were medically treated for &quot;hysterics&quot; with the first vibrators, thus being introduced to another means of achieving le petit mort, specifically without a man involved. And the New Woman was one not necessarily dependent on men--what are men supposed to do without women, with all their desires and sexual urges? The Ancient Greeks had a way of doing this, that was also meant to help their noble women remain chaste and virginal: homosexual relationships. There were always prostitutes, but you had to pay for that, you could easily catch VD, and you couldn&apos;t go out on a hunt with them afterward (I&apos;m extrapolating here). While there are absolutely no overt displays of homoerotics or homosexuality in this novel I can, however, understand that the bond between the men in this novel could be misconstrued. What I think that Stoker intended out of all of this was that men needed to keep the natural order, but should not dismiss women from the equation.Sorry if I rambled, this really got me thinking... Also, keep in mind that Stoker &quot;stole&quot; Wilde&apos;s woman, yet they remained stalwart friends. And Florence Stoker was notably frigid toward her husband, and as cited in the introduction to Barnes &amp; Noble&apos;s annotated edition, much more of an &quot;ornament&quot; for her beauty, than a willing recipient of Bram&apos;s sexual attention. Therefore, where could Stoker himself find companionship and relief for sexual frustration?;I&apos;m terrible with French, I apologize. Thank you for letting me know!;I would love to take a look at your essay if you would like to send it to me privately, or link it to me through Google Docs. I will willingly give you feedback and discuss your exploration. I am not opposed to homosexual interpretations of historic works.Also, please note that   I made an addendum to my post after re-reading the introduction of my copy.;Re: Stoker as the homophobic homosexual--could he possibly be frightened (as Jonathan Harker) of his magnetism to vampires (read: the Count himself)? Is Renfield a manifestation of what Stoker thinks would happen if he were to give into homosexual urges? Oh the possibilities... :);This is something that I have to wrestle with as a 7-12 educator, and I would like to say that, regardless of personal belief, I have been consistent in my grading. I will say that once Efthymia posts her her essay, I am bound to dig into it critically because I am so invested in the topic she is exploring. This goes along with your statement that an &quot;essay that makes you go back and look&quot; is a good one. For me, based on my reactions to students&apos; work in the past, the ends of the spectrum are what challenge me most in grading, both positively and negatively, but it is the middle ground that is hardest to be kind to...;And it was Stoker&apos;s duty to be around the theatre and the creative minds of his era because of his work. Many of them were homosexual.;Just because we have some people who seem well versed in Christian theology, is it not sacrilegious, as a Catholic, to wear a rosary, and to use the Host in any manner other than the Eucharist?;What contribution I&apos;d like to make to this discussion of &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Faith,&quot; is the literary era in which this novel was written. Romanticism was over, but their are still fragments of it in this book. Stoker wrote of the social condition of the time, but was able, among the half-true scientifics, to construct a villain and a quest that appealed to the human condition, therefore transcending time into literary infamy. Stories constructed around social issues, often pandering to the middle-class, were highly typical of Victorian British literature. Sexual desire was almost a social disease, which had to be curable or explainable through phrenology, lobotomization, and other quasi-scientific explorations. Victorians were not the minds of the Enlightenment, nor the Restoration, nor the rational Augustans. They were the children of the Romantics, living in an ever shrinking world, trying to deal with the influx of foreign ideas and people when the great railways of the world were being laid.   This books is not  centrally science versus faith,  but us versus &quot;the other&quot; or &quot;the predator.&quot; I think I&apos;d like to explore this concept further as we go into Frankenstein though...;Even still are the Lamia of Ancient Greek myth. Not exactly our vampires, but we have seen the &quot;originals&quot; evolve into sparkly-fairy, nearly pedophiliac symbol of Mormon temptation within a century...;Snarky commentary on  Twilight (the author is Mormon, no reasoning behind that part of my comment other than that). Edward is over a hundred years old and falls in love with a teenage girl. His sexuality is tempting, but Bella does not give it up until marriage. And this marriage between a mortal and vampire and the resulting child upsets the vampire world and leads to an  almost all-out battle.Might be entertaining to some, but it has little value beyond the superficial.;</string>
            <string>Oh man. I have the perfect &quot;dark and stormy night&quot; tea in my stash. Scottish Toffee Pu-erh from Wild Orchid Teas. There&apos;s also a black tea at a nearby coffee house called &quot;Starry Night.&quot; It has a hint of vanilla to it.  ;Beautifully written.

I don&apos;t think many people are very cognizant of audience within their essays  and responses. We are all here voluntarily, and not for course requirements (for the most part). Can we be a little bit more open and vivid with our writing voices? Or do you think that Prof. Rabkin doesn&apos;t want that?;As a secondary Language Arts teacher, I have to whole heartedly agree with the &quot;to a man with a hammer...&quot; comment. The sad thing is, that even college professors don&apos;t necessarily know how to give proper feedback. I fight with it with every paper I grade, every comment I make. I&apos;m working with 6-8 graders right now and MAN are they a sensitive lot. A spoonful of sugar (and appropriate language use and educational scaffolding) helps the medicine go down for sure, Ratka.;Have you been hitting the discussion boards at all? I&apos;m absolutely in love with what&apos;s going on in the &quot;Homosexuality&quot; board in the Dracula unit thread. Maybe you should find some thoughtful yet critical peers to try to appeal to within discussion board posts and don&apos;t put too much into your essays?;At least you get a rebuttal that way.;I&apos;ve studied the creative revision process extensively, so I&apos;d like to count myself as someone who  knows better.  If you really have something to say, you can ask and count on me to engage you in productive discourse.;I understand (with a bachelor degree in News Editorial Journalism) how you have to be very literate and good with words in Public Relations. I&apos;m getting the same criticism of my writing as well. I just  love the people who say I lack clarity because my syntax is just too complex for them to wrap their heads around.;My syntax was probably more convoluted than complex. Small bit of improper diction resulted in arrogance. I can be guilty of it sometimes, I will admit. It&apos;s just a defense mechanism, has been since I was little. And Laurie, you have every right to be worried, especially because you are taking this course of your own volition. Complaints should be given a voice so that if there&apos;s a true issue it can be given attention and attempts made to address it. ;Maybe you can start a way to share your drafts of your essays with people who are interested in feedback (and find a native English speaker like myself) who is willing to be constructive and kind with feedback. There is a forum were you can start &quot;meet ups&quot; and study groups.;                This is a doozy. Please don   t comment    TL;DR.    Please only respond if you are willing to discuss and work toward enlightenment on this topic.                 I am not including my essay here to use as an example for grading, because after careful review and reflection, my essay deserved the grade it received, a 4. It was a last minute effort because I was working on a project that has bearing on the degree I am working toward. Shame on me. I know I can do better.                 But as for those who are indeed grading the essays, I would like to prompt you to reflect on what feedback you are giving and how you structure it. This peer grading process begs for a highly structured rubric or process to ensure constructive feedback for those who truly want to learn. What has led me to say this is some reviewers seem to be under the impression that they know exactly the right answer, when with literary discourse, a right answer isn   t always the point. If it   s not from the horse   s mouth, so to speak, any literary analysis is speculation--theory. Getting down to philosophical brass tacks, what may seem to be purely empirical in literature is not necessarily so. Literature, on the receiving end, is an interactive process. Each one of us brings a particular understanding of culture and language, especially if English is not a first language.                That being said, I   m going to bring in a quote from our grading prompts to begin commentary on the    form    aspect of our responses:         An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.       I interpret Professor Rabkin   s preferred structure of response (correct me if I   m wrong) as giving the writer a compliment (with justification) and a suggestion for growth (with justification).                 So, to the person who wrote this for their review of my form:         peer 1     Your writings in several places are not academically fit in such kind of essay. The structure is a mix up that may lead to a confusion.            _shame on you. There is no constructive feedback here. It is lazy   without justification. I   m making the assumption I have a multi-lingual reviewer here. I warn you, before you read it, that what I have to say next will be slightly petty and aggressive. While the verb tenses agree,    such kind of essay    is not a    writings.    How can this reviewer tell me my structure is not    academically fit    when, firstly, she or he does not state precisely how it is a    mix up,    and struggles with conventions of usage of the English language her- or himself? Is it that she or he doesn   t understand how loaded the phrase    academically fit    is? Does this person mean something like,    In several places, the structure of the essay does not suit the parameters of the assignment well    instead?                            It is true that structure is very important in an academic essay. I will admit that though I separated my two body paragraphs into two opposing elements of imagery, I could have more clearly defined how I was going to do so in my thesis. We all have room for improvement. I, for one, did not come to this class to learn how to write, though. I do not understand why the grammar and structure should be graded at all by people who do not necessarily have an advanced degree in English composition or another appropriately credentialed field of study.                 My point with all that is please focus on the content of the ideas and the discourse they are attempting to spark. I wanted to talk about how light and dark were not mutually exclusive elements in Dracula, and that the opposition they represent within the book is a key to understanding the purpose of the novel. (Literally: day vs. night; fair/beautiful vs. dark/ugly. Figuratively: east/   the other    [dark] vs. west [light: e.g. enlightened west]                        (Man, I just said it infinitely better there than in my essay  _)                     And as for the peer who commented on terseness. I hate it. That   s why I left the field of journalism. I hate it with a passion, because this black and white approach to writing is very limiting, especially in the understanding and revelation it does little to encourage in the reader. I   m like Carroll, I like puzzles. Give me the baroque and rococo any day! (If you are lost in that last statement, see the story    Nativity, Caucasian    by my favorite author, Allan Gurganus.)                 Terseness and simplicity have a better place in industrial, interior, and product design (think IKEA) so that the products themselves do not distract from the function of the product. My form follows function, and it simply does not do to explore literature in a straight line. Also, to do such is indubitably boring. Because I cannot talk with you all face to face, I want to see    you    in your writing.                Okay, I   m done. Off the soapbox.    ;You definitely have some valid points. One thing I&apos;d like to say, though, is that is it too much to ask that my peers to attempt to take the same care they take writing their essays with their reviews? I doubt many have taken a class on how to grade or give feedback. I have taken several, and written a scholarly paper on it. My rant is more along the lines of identifying lack of self-reflection and the need for more constructive feedback.i will point out that we have  very clear parameters for reviewing the essays: one positive thing the reviewer liked, and an area for improvement. Some of the reviews that I didn&apos;t include here were borderline  scathing, but buried in ill-chosen connotation and phrasing, there were valuable observations and advice--and compliments.Also, I prefaced my picking at the reviewer&apos;s grammar with its pettiness. What I  really disliked was the lack of effort taken, and the fact that it was nothing but negative. What I posted was  the entire review.;As to the &quot;take a course you pay for comment,&quot; I don&apos;t know if you understand the infeasibility of that for me. I currently am living at the poverty line with luck enough to have Internet access and the ability to take out loans for school relevant to my chosen area of study (of which college level discussions of literature is not). There is an individual on another thread that revealed she was middle aged and taking this because she never got a chance to take classes like this before.  What I aimed for in my post, besides including some colorful ranting, was to ask for my peers to reflect on their contributions and consider changing how they evaluate. I am even reflecting now on how I need to structure my own responses. ;On the contrary, you do not stray too far from the purpose of my original post. This last post of yours is perhaps the most enlightening, especially with the information on MOOCs. This is what I hope to start with my original post--discourse. Thanks for the statistics you shared. On a different vein, I have taken Internet courses for my university where discussion bird posting was mandatory. I had an interesting experience with students from other areas of study that did not understand my professors requirements for posting. She was there to intervene though. As this is a free course, I know I can&apos;t expect that, but we can at least talk about it :) ...and try to encourage the ability for a responders to be responded to, as is the option in other courses. I would imagine that if Prof. Rabkin plans to improve or redesign, he might try this based on forum discussion. ;BAHAHAHAHAHAA. You just made my day! I  love commas, by the way, and think that they are effective syntactic tools.;I&apos;m glad not many people seem to understand or mind my &quot;em dash&quot; asides--I&apos;m veritably addicted!;The TV show  Once Upon a Time&apos;s take on Frankenstein is interesting, though it&apos;s heavily embedded in the premise/context of the show.;</string>
            <string>I always thought that the Grimm brothers&apos; stories were reinforcing the social values of the time (for the most part.) If you stray from the best path, there are consequences. I even read an article once that said the act of gossiping in modern times reinforces what behavior is considered acceptable by the group and what is not (i.e. worth commenting on and meriting disapproval.) The author was arguing that gossip through the ages had strengthened society by encouraging people to conform to socially accepted moral behavior.Perhaps the Grimm brother&apos;s fairytales had a similar purpose?;The id, the ego, and the supergo. I do not completely buy into the Freudian  interpretation, but it is an interesting viewpoint.  Three plays a  particularly  interesting  role in math.  The Pythagoreans also gave numbers attributes. The number three was the first &quot;male&quot; number. Odd numbers were considered masculine, one being neither masculine or feminine. Three was considered by them to have power because it was a tiebreaker. There is a power in  tie breaking, which relates back to their idea of masculinity. The triad has other properties attributed to it, which you can read about here,  http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa06/Hobgood/Pythagoras.html  ;I think that the punishment was inevitable once she started asking beyond a cottage over a hovel. I don&apos;t think the point was asking for divinity is deserving of punishment, but if you are the kind of person who wants more and more, you will never be satisfied. As she progresses in material status her level of contentment does not. Ultimately she is thrown back down to where she started and she is as full of discontent as when she was a king. She will always want more and will never have contentment.  ;</string>
            <string>Abigail, it&apos;s an interesting thought about gossiping elaborate social norms and compel people to following them. I might soften my inacceptance of gossiping and regard it in more complicated way. Thank you! And I think your idea about the fairytales is very reasonable: it&apos;s like social system strenghens itself by their means. :D;A reluctant bride gives her bridegroom a comeuppance in this one. The bride, a symbol of innocence, is uncomfortable in the presence of her bridegroom. The story gives a picture of her as a sweet, innocent girl as it refers to her as the &quot;pretty bride&quot; who should not go where &quot;evil things betide.&quot;I was also intrigued by the line, &quot;Death will be your spouse.&quot; The image of the bride being devoured by her husband seemed reminiscent of the way woman were thought of as property during medieval times. By getting married, you were giving away the right to make your own decisions and your own personhood.The imagery of the peas and lentils having budded overnight also stood out to me as being about lost innocence. Peas bud when fertilized, and the girl lost her innocence by watching them eat the other girl. ;Thanks! I think it probably will be.;I really like your analysis of this! That is intriguing on the multiple natures of society. The interesting thing about fairy tales is that most characters are either all bad or all good, which is never true in real life. Even the best of us flaws, and even the worst of humanity has good moments.I think the gender roles are important in that the mouse is the one who had to stay home all day keeping house, and so she missed the chance to &quot;eat the fat&quot; or see all the world has to offer. The cat is also dismissive of her contributions and opinions, saying, &quot;That&apos;s because you are always sitting at home in your little grey frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying all sorts of things.&quot; In the end, she ends up getting taken advantage of and killed. It is interesting that another story, &quot;Hans in Luck,&quot; also seemed a warning against being too trusting.;I agree. Clever Gretel in particular bothered me. Looking at it from a strict morality standpoint, you wonder why she gets away with it all. The purpose of that tale almost seemed to be to teach children not to trust others, and perhaps they would have an easier time of it than if they had to learn the lesson the hard way- through life experience. There&apos;s still a part of me that thinks, though, they will learn that the world is not all good, life is not fair, ect. soon enough, why not let them enjoy their childhood innocence a little longer?;I wonder if in some instances it did have religious implications for the  author/reader, especially considering the time period in which it was  written. I noticed in Faithful John, there were three ravens discussing  the three tragedies/tests that would befall the King before he could  marry the beautiful woman. The story reached a turning point for the  better when both Faithful John and the two prince&apos;s lives were saved  (three lives!) while the Queen was at her prayers in the church. The authors could have had her be anywhere. I think in this case it was deliberate references, considering the importance the number three has always had to the church. ;Is anyone else here from Oklahoma?;I had read many of these tales as a child, but I was amazed by all the stuff I missed when I was younger! It was fun to analyze them as an adult rather than just hearing them through the simplistic viewpoint of a child. Pretty sure I missed all the symbolism back then and just focused on the plot.;</string>
            <string>It was definitely five, because a message popped up that I had completed the assignment when I did five. I think it would mark you as incomplete if you only did four.;I think that is a great idea! I was intrigued by the scene when Alice was trying to go through the door into the garden and was always either too big or too little. I think it was a commentary on the changes that occur when growing up, when you outgrow some activities but are still too young to participate in some of the rituals of adulthood.;In the first book, Alice is moving within a clearly defined universe, with only so many stopping places that are all intertwined. She starts in the rabbit hole, which leads to the small room with a door to the garden and a key. Then in traveling around Wonderland, all the characters are interrelated to each other, with the tea party characters, the Duchess, the  Cheshire cat  and the white rabbit showing up later at the Queen&apos;s croquet. Wonderland seems to revolve around the Queen and her croquet, as even she is not present, the Cheshire cat, the white Rabbit and the Duchess all mention her and seem very interested/involved with her.;I agree that programs used to spot grammatical mistakes do not catch anything but the most obvious mistakes. ;Carrol seems to have captured the feeling of a dream perfectly in both stories, both with Alice&apos;s vague sense of frustration with the logic of the things that happen and with the scenery shifting so abruptly. I frequently have that happen in dreams. First I am one place, then another, with nor rhyme or reason to it.;I just gave an essay a six for the first time in this course. It had a unique thesis that made me think about the story in a new light, and was proved by examples from the story and the author&apos;s interpretation of those. It had impeccable grammar and sentence structure, and I could not think of a single way that the author could improve his/her essay within the word count allowed. In fact, I wished the word count was higher, so the author could give more examples and develop it further. So, for me at least, that is what makes an outstanding essay.;I am going to an Alice and Wonderland-themed fundraiser in my hometown for a nonprofit later this week, so I think it&apos;s pretty pervasive. It is also referenced in numerous pop culture and literary works, including being a running theme in the Matrix movie trilogy.;I found Carroll&apos;s use of morals in the scene with the Duchess at the croquet game to be interesting. Especially after just reading the Grimm tales, where the morals were the main point of the stories, it seemed that Carroll was gently mocking that genre of literature. The Duchess finds a moral in everything, and they rarely make much sense. For instance, at one point, she says, &quot;Flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is- &apos;Birds of a feather flock together.&apos;&quot; Here Carroll is having the Duchess spout out common sayings during the Victorian period as morals, often contradicting herself.Carroll also used her morals to show off some of his amusing wordplay. I loved the line, &quot;There&apos;s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is - &apos;The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.&apos;&quot; What do you all think the point was of the scene involving the Duchess and the morals?&apos;;I really like third person, especially if the author allows you to see the same scene from multiple perspectives. You don&apos;t have to use first person to be in someone&apos;s head. One of my favorite authors of all time, Orson Scott Card, tells the exact same story from two different perspectives in Ender&apos;s Game and Ender&apos;s Shadow. Another favorite is the Time Traveler&apos;s Wife, where you shift back and forth between Clare and Henry&apos;s perspective, all while staying in third person. For those of you who like first person, what are some examples of your favorite writing that uses this?;</string>
            <string>I do think the author had it be more about saving souls than anything else in the end. When they kill Dracula, Mina says that &quot;I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.&quot; I don&apos;t think the author primarily intended the story to be an action/fight book.;I also thought the use of the communion wafer to keep them safe was interesting. Bram Stoker seems to be Catholic, as some of his terminology - the rosary, calling communion the Host - is specifically Catholic. In communion, many Catholics believe the wafer, or bread, becomes the body of Christ and the wine becomes the blood. The blood of Christ has healing, redemptive power in Christian tradition. It is the symbol of forgiveness of sins.As Peter points out above, Lucy is rejuvenated through pure blood. Conversely, when Dracula forces Mina to swallow his blood, it binds her to him. He says, &quot;And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin.&quot;I found these references to blood and the Christian tradition very interesting.;Very good analysis! I do think Bram Stoker purposely made this analogy, since he uses Christian symbolism, such as communion, the rosary ect. all throughout the book.;</string>
            <string>I think if the monster had asked for a bride before he killed for the first time, then he might have gotten a different answer. That said, I think Mary Shelley purposely made the monster a thwarted Adam- an Adam without an Eve. We are sympathetic because we cannot imagine being the only one of our kind in the universe. Shelley is telling a different kind of creation story than the one told in both Genesis and Paradise Lost, as Natasha noted above. A flawed man can only create a flawed creation.;Like Dracula, this book contains references to Christianity, particularly in its discussion of the relationship between creator and creation. This can be read several ways. The monster resents his creation in such a form that all others despise him, and he was given no mate. It is interesting that Paradise Lost, Milton&apos;s dramatic retelling of both the fall of Satan and the fall of mankind, was one of the three books the monster read early in his development. The monster himself wonders where his place was in the story, when he says, &quot;Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for  often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter  gall of envy rose within me.&quot;Satan was rumored envious of God&apos;s throne, and in Paradise Lost, staged a failed coup to try to take it.Later, when vowing his revenge after Frankenstein has denied him his bride, his Eve, he says, &quot;I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.&quot; The snake (Satan) waited in the grass in Paradise Lost, to tempt the woman to eat the apple. The monster remains focused on ruining his creator, just as Satan in Paradise Lost is waging war against God, his creator, by &quot;ruining&quot; humankind through temptation and the fall.What do you all think of Shelley&apos;s hints that the monster might be Satan in the creation story?;I think Frankenstein&apos;s monster represents the darker side of Frankenstein himself and humanity as a whole. I think Mary Shelley intended the text to have an actual monster, but for the reader to infer that Frankenstein represented something more. ;Yes, that is interesting. The monster when he can be viewed as an abstract creation - a work of art, really - is beautiful, but a breathing, moving, thinking monster is horrifying. ;</string>
            <string>I was intrigued by the fact that Georgina&apos;s birthmark was in the shape of a hand, and that it could not be removed without killing her. What do you all think it symbolized?I could see it being taken two ways:As her only imperfection marking her as mortal, it symbolizes original sin and her place in a fallen world.This is supported by the fact that Aminadab, who is described as representing &quot;man&apos;s physical nature&quot; says he would never remove it, while Aylmer, who was described as &quot;type of the spiritual element,&quot; was disgusted by it. Or the birthmark symbolizes her humanity. By trying to perfect her, her husband is attempting to with science remove all the problems of humanity. Perhaps the author is hinting at science trying to create immortality?I was also intrigued by the story mentioning that Georgina&apos;s other admirers credited it to a fairy laying a hand on her. What does everyone else think   the hand represents?;His mother died when he was two of tuberculosis, then his wife died at age 25 (after 12 years of marriage) of the same disease. Perhaps these experiences made him think about death more than most?;</string>
            <string>I am writing my first assignment on The Queen Bee. I think that this particular fairy tale is still a great story  which can help  us adapt  to the world we live in now... (Even thus, I always am a bit annoyed when the hero chooses a girl to marry and she  doesn&apos;t seem to have a word to say about that  ;) Anyway I will not discuss any of those aspects in my paper, and instead I will look at highly interesting themes, the way they are symbolised and articulated together.;A car or a wain drawn by the horses is an ancient symbol of the sun  travelling along the firmament. It is very archaic for it is shared by  many cultures. White horses = morning sun, red ones = noon sun, black =  night sun being carried beneath the ground (according to the ancient  belief).The folktales were retold through centuries, passing from  one generation to another. The surroundings and ways of life changed,  much of the older myths and traditions were forgotten, meaning of some  was lost or transformed. New traditions were created, new details that  concerned current life were added. Each fairy tale developed as a living  organism, changed, aged, gave its offsprings, merged with others. And  writing it down means stopping this development. Printed word could be  only reprinted, misprint is a fault (we can play it at the stage, make a  film etc., but it&apos;s quite a different story).&quot;The Raven&quot; is a good illustration: it contains very archaic elements as well as rather modern. For example, the letter and the maps.  I&apos;m sure they were added lately. But not before the words on the paper became a common thing: in this tale the literate person is a  magician or a sorceress. A land-chart is a miracle! You can find any town you want:  what an amazing thing!(And just a little guess. The giant  mentions a child left in the house. I think it&apos;s a snatch of older plot  layer: there might have been three brothers, big, middle and little, but  the original episode was replaced to the one with maps though this  irrelative child stayed. Just an assumption. :D)And one more interpretation of red. Fire? White and black: day and night? Light and darkness?White - red - black may suggest to a contemporary reader changing feelings: hope - alarm - despair. :);Thank you!The article is googlable.;I&apos;ve just finished this story and it stroke me that in addition to other interpretations it might contain some implications of adultery: the cat takes a husband&apos;s role and the mouse stands for a wife (in the translation to my language both the cat and the mouse are &quot;she&quot;, by the way), the pot of fat symbolizes the marriage (or maybe its physical aspect), hiding it in the church    \approx wedding and vowing, even the kittens may stand for children born outside marriage. Different species may even symbolize an unequal match. :D;I like your interpretation!;That&apos;s nice! Intrapersonal relations instead of interpersonal ones!;&quot;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: the neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!&quot; ( Luke 12:22-24) &quot;And he said: &quot;Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (Matthew 18:3)But Hans does not show awareness of this position.

That&apos;s one more reason for me to prefer authored stories over folktales.);And about the duty. Isn&apos;t Hans&apos; duty to take care of his mother? And squandering his possessions away is not the best way to perfom it.))I always think of problem of responsibility in the connection to this philosophy.

            <string>Would you? :P :D;Karen, funny, I thought the same when I first heard about Karoline Leach&apos;s studies.;</string>
            <string>Reading these stories yesterday I was surprised to find how many were familiar to me from childhood. We had a collection of   books of fairy tales at home (perhaps a grandparent had collected these old books?) and although I didn&apos;t recognise the wonderful illustrations by Walter Crane, I must have read the Lucy Crane translations.The story Rumpelstiltskin fascinated me with its   associations of alchemy, spinning straw into gold.;</string>
            <string>Oh, my ultimate favorite is Six Soldiers of Fortune. I&apos;ve already read the whole book and there is no other tale that made me think as much as Six Soldiers of Fortune did. It&apos;s such a wonderful model of teamwork!;</string>
            <string>Ooohh. Now I have to reread that one. I think I&apos;m am becoming numbed to the &quot;they got married&quot; parts I missed it.;I&apos;d love to pick a favorite, but ... I hate absolutely every story the Grimm bros. wrote. Each and every one seems to lay out what looks to be a moral, and then either end it in some sort of pointless misery, or end up teaching the exact opposite of the expected moral. I can see the humor in it, and I can see the literary importance - but I just can&apos;t get myself to actually enjoy a single one of their writings.;This is all making me wonder about how people in early 19th c. rural Germany conceptualised &quot;luck&quot;. I know that the concept of individual identity was quite different in some ways, so was &quot;luck&quot; more like the modern notion of random chance or the idea of &quot;luck&quot; as an inherent quality you carry about with you (which was prevalent in my neck of the woods, and still continues with the idea that a person can be innately &quot;lucky&quot;).Not very helpful. Just mulling.;I think that luck itself plays an extremely important role in most of the fairy tales. Like, even if luck is not directly mentioned, a person can be lucky by being cunning and intelligent (like in clever Gretel, six soldiers of fortune, and the rabbits bride) Gretel is lucky because she doesn&apos;t get caught due to her intelligence, and the six soldiers use their skills to outsmart the king which is complete luck in itself that they all came together. Also the maiden in The Rabbits Bride is lucky that she was able to trick the rabbit and return home. Luck also plays roles in many stories of heroism, and the like.;One of my favorite editions of &quot;Household Tales&quot; begins with an introduction by A.S. Byatt and she does a fabulous job of outlining what makes these tales so enduring. That introduction is well worth the read. ;OK;Rebecca, that is really insightful. We tend to lump the Grimm collection together as &quot;fairy tales&quot;, and because fairy tales have become morality tales, it&apos;s hard to get round our expectations of what the Tales were at the time.  ;What I think is interesting is that there&apos;s so much scope for acting out these tales, as Anahita mentioned in relation to her grandmother. They&apos;re so succinct and spared of detailed description that they make the imagination work really hard and that provides huge artistic licence when it comes to taking it from the book and back to oral tradition where it came from. I think the point about patterns is a good one, especially when we look at the tales from an oral perspective. It&apos;s like in the Odyssey where there are set phrases that repeat again and again.  ;As I said, much argument in many directions. I thought it an interesting perspective, in current times as well with LOTR and Song of Fire and Ice (Lewis obviously used symbols from his tradition, yet still honored ancient motifs)...it&apos;s nice to know that the old themes still ring true.In terms of Disney, he was speaking mainly of Fantasia, the use of having Mickey as an apprentice to a Sorcerer, he contrasted that with books that had been banned at the time for obvious witchcraft symbolism...;I love that you figured this out.   No, it&apos;s not actually important to understanding the story, but the effort behind it makes me smile.   I pictured the gold as a gold coin, the circumference of his head.   Anyway... that&apos;s quite a lot of money to trade for a few stones that you then lost.   ;The false bride story recurs a lot in Household Stories.   Any theories about what&apos;s going on here?I naturally went looking at the greatest literary analysis resource ever (TVTropes.com) and found plenty of examples of the Bride and Switch, but no real insights about the meaning of it.;It seems similar to the fantasy (or fear) children have of finding out that their parents aren&apos;t their real parents, too, but I feel like there must be more going on.   I thought of the &quot;You&apos;re not the woman I married&quot; thing, but the constant recurrence makes it feel like the switch addresses some more intense or primal fear.;So we&apos;ve met the lecturer, but are there community TAs (or, since this is a UM course offering, GSIs ;) ) we&apos;ll being seeing around the forum?   Who else is on the course staff?;</string>
            <string>I think Six Soldiers of Fortune could be well served to be written from a point of view like you mention, Rebecca. The retribution the six soldiers get would be well suited for a retelling from a modern veteran&apos;s point of view.;Cheri, I think you&apos;ve hit the nail on the head for me, thank you - Irish tales have depth of character (and, often, development of character). Even if you look across versions, the Fionn from the Salmon of Knowledge tale is not quite the same Fionn from the Giant&apos;s Causeway tale - and not just because he can access greater knowledge by sucking his thumb. He has grown and developed in that time. There is a sense of forward momentum.Karen, your point about the greater development of Irish tales is well taken. If there is a difference between the Grimm tales and Irish tales in that respect though, I would suggest that it&apos;s more due to *cultural* underpinnings than historical ones. My ancestry is not terribly distantly German and Irish, and I have noticed that my German relations tend to tell their folktales the same way each time - small details may differ, but on the whole, it is the same tale. That&apos;s not a criticism - consistency across versions may well be why the Grimms were able to compile the tales in the first place. Irish culture, on the other hand, encourages the storyteller to make the story their own. There are as many distinct versions of Cuchulainn/Setanta as there are people who know his stories - and more. There are some versions which feel like heresy (and which ones those are will differ from person to person) and everyone is convinced that only *they* know the &quot;right&quot; ones. I *have* encountered that with Grimm and other germanic tales, but not often. I have also heard Irish storytellers tell &quot;their versions&quot; drastically differently on two different nights, because &quot;the night is different, so the story must be, too.&quot; (Woody Guthrie made many similar statements over the years regarding his music.) This aspect of Irish folktales sounds very romantic, but it can often be very *frustrating* - a close friend of the family once told the best version of Children of Lir I&apos;ve ever heard, and he&apos;s not repeated it since. Not because he doesn&apos;t want to (although that may be true), but he literally doesn&apos;t remember it. So, I&apos;m stuck with hazy memories of a particular night when I was 12, and a particular version I loved, don&apos;t remember the details of, and can never hear again... but, my friend points out, am I not better for hearing it the once?Irish culture *embraces* the transientness and individuality of oral storytelling with an enthusiasm unlike any other culture I know of. The most important part of the story is the experience of hearing it - the words are seen as the vehicle, not the destination.That&apos;s not to say the Irish have cornered the market on that notion - I have known fantastic storytellers of all nationalities. But the Irish have a sort of cultural endorsement at their backs, that of *course* everyone&apos;s story will always be different and of *course* there is no one &quot;proper&quot; tale - just the right tale for the right experience on the right night with the right people. This notion goes all the way back to the social position of the bards in Ancient Irish culture - the bard was second in status only to the King, because the bard held all the history.On Irish Nationalism and Home Rule - I could write a thread&apos;s worth of posts on that, but they&apos;d be outside the scope of this course, and I don&apos;t want to bore anyone to death. :) I will say you&apos;re correct to a certain degree - if you look at very early versions of Irish fairytales, they are less romanticized than the ones we tell now. However, they are less different than you&apos;d think. With the caveat that I do not *speak* Sean-Ghaeilge (the kind of Irish we&apos;re talking about if you&apos;re going that far back in history, pre-Home Rule) I speak enough Modern Irish to have puzzled out pieces of the early written versions. (There are also still a bare handful of Sean-Ghaeilge scholars who are busily translating everything they can get their hands on into Irish and English before those manuscripts are lost to us - their work has been invaluable to me in my poking around.) That&apos;s not to say that the history of Ireland hasn&apos;t affected the stories... that would be an impossible and ridiculous claim to make. Morgan Llwellyn is probably one of the best known authors who retells the old tales through an oft (but not always) Republican/Nationalist lens, and is a good author to check out if you want to compare those retellings to other ones. But it&apos;s important to remember that, as with the Germanic tales, Irish tales so predate written language that the people who tell them tend to resist allowing political machinations to make much of a dent in the way they tell the story.;Jacob (Isaac&apos;s son) fell victim to the bride and switch, yes, but it was never put right the way the Grimms&apos; stories do: the sisters were bitter rivals, and the competition for sons got pretty ugly, right down to sending their servants in for Jacob to impregnate.;Don&apos;t be ridiculous.   *Everyone* at Michigan is cute.But I was more interested in knowing who we should be paying close attention to in the forum.;In Grimm, the tails of furry woodland creatures seem to be a popular mode of transportation, even for male protagonists.

It&apos;s not wrong to put your own experience in, but it may not be the most effective use of your limited words.   Say you wanted to make the argument that the Grimm stories are scary.   You could support that with information about your own personal experience (&quot;I was scared by them as a child&quot;), but your reader could easily say, &quot;I found them boring, so why does your experience carry more weight than my experience?&quot;On the other hand, you could support the claim with another kind of argument (&quot;The Grimm stories tap into universal primal fears of abandonment by parents&quot;), which is a stronger argument, because to refute it, the reader would have to come up with some reason that abandonment isn&apos;t a universal fear.;The legality of the whole site (as with any site with &quot;Bay&quot; in the name, these days) is questionable.

So I frame the question in terms of sin: is it sinful to write about sin?   I mean, if you ask the average Christian bookstore patron, they could not reconcile the idea that a book might both be written by a Christian *and* contain a sex scene or an F-bomb.   Can you write a story that depicts something you despise?The problem is, without sin, there&apos;s no plot.   There&apos;s no story.   Every plot needs a problem, and the problem is always, in one way or another, caused by sin.   Now, you can pick and choose the sin- kids shows on the Disney channel are light on drug abuse and physical violence, but they substitute plenty of relational aggression- or you can be very delicate in your depiction of sin.   But there has to be sin to make the plot go.   Kind of like gasoline is smelly and dangerous, but you have to have it to drive anywhere.(Of course, my short answer to my bowdlerizing funda-gelical fellow Christian is usually, &quot;God depicted plenty of sin and used strong language when writing the Bible; does that mean he condones it?&quot;);I suspect we will find out in the upcoming lecture videos.;If it takes 100 words to state your thesis, maybe it would help to start by narrowing your thesis!;I think an essay is the literary equivalent of a proof in geometry: You make a claim, then you support it.As long as there&apos;s a claim and evidence, an essay can have whatever length, style, language, etc. the author deems effective.;Yes, but since the fruit was enshrined in medieval art as an apple, it kind of doesn&apos;t matter much for the purposes of a literature class.

Sometimes high schools or small colleges rely on distance learning to expand what they can offer their students, so they&apos;re often willing to honor work done for Coursera classes or other MOOCs.;Olivia, the reading load is typical of an upper-level undergraduate literature course.   But keep in mind that there are still 9 more weeks, and you don&apos;t even have to do them all to earn a Statement of Accomplishment.   You can skip a few if they seem like too much reading, or if you&apos;re just having a busy week.But if you have 100 pages of highlights, it sounds like the problem isn&apos;t the amount of reading; it may be that you need a more focused note-taking strategy.   You might find it more effective to do a quick overview of part of the book, to find a theme or pattern you&apos;re interested in following.   Then you can go back and do a more in-depth reading of the material, taking notes only on that one theme.

Why shouldn&apos;t others dock you for using a five-space indent?Maybe this is because I&apos;m in linguistics, and we spend too much time writing for journals in various disciplines to get picky about MLA or APA or any other style guide.   But this seems silly.   There are conventions which are (nearly) universally applicable to written English (spelling, punctuation, etc.), and we should stick to those.

First-  and third-person narration are tools with two different functions.I know Stephen King says you only get to write your first novel in the first person; after that, you have to grow up.   I then stack Stephen King up against Kazuo Ishiguro, who writes exclusively in first-person, often with unreliable narrators, and decide King could not possibly have meant that as a hard-and-fast rule.;A very small handful of extremely skilled writers may be able to get away with an *implied* thesis, without including a one-sentence thesis statement.But explicitly stated or not, every essay needs to *have* a thesis.For essays in this course, not stating a thesis is usually a sign that there isn&apos;t one.   That&apos;s a problem.;In some ways, it probably is cultural.   We know that some cultures expect the reader to do the work of inferring the meaning of a story, and some expect the author to make things explicit.   Western culture tends toward the latter.;I have found many of the videos downright silly in this regard.   There may be many ways to demonstrate that a story incorporates themes of fertility, but &quot;A tower is shaped like a penis!&quot; doesn&apos;t seem a particularly strong argument.I also have trouble with student essays which try to apply women&apos;s studies theories of the past 20 years to the thought processes of people writing 150 years ago.   Seriously, not *everything* has to be about women&apos;s (dis)empowerment.   Not only are some of these arguments unjustified based on the text, they&apos;re also tedious to read over and over and over.   You start to get the sense that people aren&apos;t interacting with the text at all, just rehashing their own narratives about the evil sexist past.;Anonymous, that seems unreasonable to me.   This isn&apos;t a class in MLA format!   If I&apos;m quoting from an Alice book, and I&apos;m framing it so that you know where in the story I&apos;m quoting from, I shouldn&apos;t have to eat up my word count on your favorite method of referencing a page.   I&apos;m assuming good faith on the part of a fellow student-reader; if you want to know the exact context, it&apos;s very simple to search one of the electronic editions for the text.Now people who are using quotes from introductions by other critics would need to cite them.   But from the main body of the work?   That&apos;s unnecessary.Besides, the MLA was not handed down to us on tablets of stone.;Peer reviewers, what have you seen in essays that make you reach for the 1 button?What makes you facepalm?What do you never want to see in an essay ever, ever again?(Without singling out any individual, of course.)Here are mine:Don&apos;t think of teh childrenz.   In each round of essays, I&apos;ve had one that spent all 300 words complaining about material that was inappropriate for children, in the judgment of the author.

At least, in general, one doesn&apos;t use it correctly.   One also makes one&apos;s writing sound dull and stuffy.   One might do better to come up with a noun substitute.

No breaks, or five or six breaks, is often an indicator that something is seriously wrong with the organization. ;I&apos;m of the opinion that your paragraph breaks should correspond to the major points that would appear if you were to outline your text.

            <string>I would have to readily agree this is my favorite as well, though I enjoyed reading most of them, and enjoyed several of the others as well. The stories of the 12 brothers, or the Raven with its mountain of glass were good ones. I enjoy the timelessness of the tales, but I think reading these really makes you think about what a cruel, cold and uncaring world this can be. The story of the death of the hen set that tone, but it is strong all the way through this collection. I am sure for maybe most of the world this is what the world is like for them. I guess maybe that makes some of the other stories where a character like the sister in the 12 brothers, acts in humility and self sacrificing love for her brothers who were so hatefully treated, helps to right the wrong and make the world a better place?  ;Could it be connected with wedding traditions of having bridesmaids (so that evil spirits will mistake a bridesmaid for the bride, leaving the bride safe from any harm) and wearing a veil?;</string>
            <string>They also act as &apos;evidence&apos; that these fantastic/supernatural events &apos;actually occurred&apos; - because it&apos;s not a realistic story, the different sources can corroborate what&apos;s happening and make it seem more real;It&apos;s also funny when emergencies happen and the person doesn&apos;t just drop the pen and go but keeps writing that there&apos;s an emergency  - finishes their diary entry - and then goes.

Generally I think the different forms of writing are well-justified but there are  one or two emergency  moments like this  when it&apos;s not very believable.;I found this webpage that looks quite useful, about the development of vampire characteristics (powers,  limitations)  in poetry and stories before Dracula.   It doesn&apos;t go into characteristics that might have existed in folklore and superstition, so it won&apos;t tell you whether the authors created the characteristics themselves or if they were already part of the vampire legend, but it looks quite interesting:http://www.simplysupernatural-vampire.com/vampire-characteristics-preDracula.html;Perhaps, although it does give a list of other things Stoker added and doesn&apos;t mention them.

            <string>I thought at least part of the reason why Walton admires him is so that we are inclined to side with Frankenstein from the beginning (before we find out what he did).   Also because he&apos;s the title character the reader might be primed to be on his side (although this doesn&apos;t work with every title character - Dracula).   It&apos;s only as we find out what Frankenstein did that this changes and we have to judge him for ourselves (there&apos;s a lot of judgement in the book - Justine&apos;s trial, people judging the monster on his appearance, the monster judging the whole of humanity);I&apos;ve not seen the recent Frankenweenie film but it&apos;s based on a live-action Tim Burton short film that is also worth seeing.   It&apos;s here on youtube  after the Vincent short:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rcPe9sojpc.   It seems more sinister in live-action black and white.;There seems to be a lot of criticism of Frankenstein in the forum, so just for balance, I thought I&apos;d start a thread about how good it is.   The first time I read it I did find the writing style hard to get into so I can relate to everyone who says that here, but re-reading it for this course I&apos;ve found it surprisingly engrossing (perhaps after reading more works from that era).   In my opinion it&apos;s much better written than Dracula and this time I&apos;ve been able to appreciate the poetry in Shelley&apos;s writing style.   I think this is  about the third time I&apos;ve read both  Dracula and Frankenstein and I&apos;ve been noticing how  (only sometimes) badly written Dracula is and how well-written Frankenstein is.   Frankenstein as a character can be difficult to admire but isn&apos;t that the point?I know from the forums that lots of people don&apos;t agree and that&apos;s fair enough but if anyone else wants to defend Frankenstein maybe here would be a good place to do it?;</string>
            <string>I am also loving this course.   I&apos;d read some of the books before but having to think about them more deeply can be really enlightening.   A lot of people moan about the nature of the assessment but for a free course I don&apos;t think we can complain about being graded by peers rather than staff, otherwise it wouldn&apos;t be free or open to so many people.   I think I&apos;m getting more out of reading and evaluating other people&apos;s essays than from the grade and feedback I receive for my essays.   No matter what score I give to other essays, it&apos;s always useful to see the work from someone  else&apos;s perspective.;I think it was just a coincidence that you only got Hawthorne essays to evaluate.   You could choose to write about both Hawthorne and Poe or just Hawthorne, or just Poe.   So don&apos;t worry - you didn&apos;t do anything silly.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m still getting fluctuating standards in essays.   In Week 2 the majority of the essays I evaluated were great and made me want to step my own essays up a gear but in Week 3 most of them were low-average.   In Week 4 again they had generally improved but this week  I didn&apos;t give any 3s, mostly 2s and one 1.   It just depends on the luck of the draw.   I&apos;m not sticking to the expected percentages for 1s, 2s and 3s each week but I think over the whole course it should balance out to match the percentages quite well.;Religion&apos;s also being made fun of in The Invisible Man (more light-heartedly perhaps),  with the invisible man targeting the vicarage for burglary and later taking all of Reverend Bunting&apos;s clothes;</string>
            <string>What really jumped out at me about this tale was how the witch was wronged. She had that high wall around her garden and still had her garden raided. I assume that as a witch she was an outcast character but still she disserved justice, and that   s what I see initially here is that she got justice, though she set it at a terrible price for the parents to pay. They seemed to be the initial instigators of this story? What were the standards of unusual punishment then? I think the penalty for a lot of crimes, was death. Yet I think we see that the witches harshness to Rapunzel justified her freedom in the end.  ;Kind of like loading the trap with cheese huh, it&apos;s a thought.;Fantastic comment.;I think her rights might depend on the culture? In our society when she became an adult she would be free to make her decisions, but I   m not sure if they would see it that way, a couple hundred years ago, in a different culture?  ;Wow that was very interesting. I didn   t know that about Medusa. It makes you see the story differently when you see the witch as Athena. Very good!   ;In the Old Testament law of the Bible, if a woman was raped in the country she had an excuse, because it was assumed she screamed for help and no one heard, but if she was raped in the city, she was subject to judgment along with her rapist. Here she was in the country, but had to allow her attacker in herself? Is that how this situation would be understood?  ;Some good thoughts!;I wonder if it has anything to do with where the stories came from? Who was telling the stories and who was the audience? Were the stories told mostly by women in the house? Were they told to mostly to children? Do you suppose the men in their circles and amongst themselves told different stories? There were a lot of stories with girls in negative roles but also a lot of them had characters in which the girls were very positive. The goose girl, the story of the sister in the 12 brothers, Grehel, there are a lot of situations where there is a humble industrious girl as opposed to a lazy self-centered girl? Do you think these were mostly tales to encourage girls to live such lives? There don   t seem to be as many similar portrayals of boys?   ;I don   t see men as the evil heart of these stories. In the Hansel and Gretel tale Hansel initially takes the actions to save Gretel and himself, but in the end Gretel has to find the courage to take action and save them both. Another story that comes to mind is the Raven in which the woman initiates the action to free herself, but the hero needs to first rise above his weaknesses, and find the strength to free her. She initiated the action first though. I don   t see characters in any of these stories that are the bulging heroes in the movies we have today, male or female. Again the Raven has the example, seen in other tales where the hero goes out into the world, and attracts the characters of strength that actually overcome the hurdles. He is only the determined leader. Also As I   ve asked other places, do you think these are tales told by men, or women in the societies. I think they are more likely to be the tales the women have passed down and told to the children. I don   t see these as   tales the men would tell in their circles?  ;Wow thanks for those references. They were very interesting as to why these tales were written and apparently where they were coming from. My German isn   t the best, but it looks like the Grimms were motivated to try and preserve a sense of German culture before it was buried under the French culture. Also that these were not gathered from the old farmers across the German country side, but from the daughters of a few Huguenot families? So they were more French tales?  ;That was very insightful! I hadn   t understood it that way.  ;</string>
            <string>I agree. It&apos;s people like you, who posses that terrifying level of reading analysis, that I respect immensely.;</string>
            <string>You are absolutely right about how different these sets of tales are, but the reason is that Anderson creates literary fairy tales while the Grimm&apos;s take from the oral tradition.   Anderson creates his stories out of his own experiences, so they reflect his own life concerns.   He did not feel he fit in, he did feel lonely, and he did yearn for closer connections to others as you note.   As the artist, his concerns passed through the crucible of his imagination to emerge as his tales.   Good for you for noticing Anderson, as the sole creator of his tales, has a consistent theme; however, The Grimms, who recorded the oral materials and tried to produce a finished tale by including what was common to the oral stories they recorded, produced material that widely reflected the concerns of a whole culture rather than one artist.   ;My take on Alice is that the Identity theme is the predominant one in the text but Carroll is exhaustive in his exploration and questioning of what constitutes one&apos;s identity.   He starts with the concept of time with the Rabbit whose watch constantly tells him how late he is.   Carroll questions all aspects of how the individual understands language and our use of language impacts our construct of time.   So, the Mad Hatter and March Hare ask Alice if she knows time to which she replies that she can beat time when she plays music.   The Hatter notes that Time will not stand to be beaten so she can not know him very well.    For Carroll, what is time?   Because we define it in language which is a human construct, does time exit as the human conceives it, does it shift with perspective (Einstein&apos;s relativity theory), or does it exist only in the physical universe with the sun&apos;s movement from light to dark??    Carroll turns Alice&apos;s brain upside down and inside out with his language explorations, and isn&apos;t the the child&apos;s experience of the world as she grows within time??Just some fascination with Carroll&apos;s concern with time and its impact on everything, but especially on creating the framework that limits our understanding of the world.   A lot of questions......;I would call applying Freud&apos;s Electra Complex theory to Gretel the &apos;subtext&apos; of the story rather than &apos;back story&quot; which is a confusing and non-technical term.   Another parallel to &apos;back story&apos; might be to see a Greek myth as the &apos;bones&apos; on which the Hansel and Gretel was built.   The technical term for this is &apos;palimpsest&apos;, but the phrase &apos;back story&apos; could be used to avoid the technical term but using layman&apos;s terms leads to confusion.   To apply psychological theories to literature has been very popular but the Freudian stuff is from the mid twentieth century.   Why not apply other, more recent psychologists for interpretation?   Why not see Gretel&apos;s finally separating from Hansel&apos;s protection and taking the independent choice to save both of them as her development of a new identity separate from her dependence on her father or brother??   Piaget&apos;s Stages of Cognitive Development would apply here.   Why not apply Erickson&apos;s stages of psychosocial development to her??   Erickson&apos;s theories would work too!!   Why Freud??   Sex Sells!!!   To interpret, one needs to a new way of seeing the old story and to shock the reader while doing so.   How many times does someone say to himself, &quot;Now, why didn&apos;t I see that!   What is wrong with me?&quot;   Isn&apos;t that how we feel in the presence of &quot;The Professional?&quot;   So, I am proud and pleased that my fellow students do not swallow interpretations whole but question them no matter whose they are!!   Healthy questioning makes us better students and develops what we all need: confidence in ourselves.   In the long run (cliche here!!) maybe interpretations, whether sexual or not, show us more about the interpreter than about the story itself!!!;</string>
            <string>Thank you so much for the site!!   Besides the Grim ms, it has wonderful materials, too, on so many other writers!!!   Thanks for providing what we would probably not find on our own!!;Thank you for sharing your frustration with us!!   I, too, am outraged at the accusation of plagiarism with no evidence other than &quot;it seems likely,&quot; and &quot;I wish I could think otherwise.&quot;   What further bugs me is the possible background of this evaluator.   Is it an undergraduate student who is so used to poor writing that anything decent sounds &apos;too professional&apos;?Or is it an educator used to evaluating student work who, again, expects poor writing so anything good must be plagiarized? Either way, the accusation itself is very serious and needed to be handled by the course staff.   The program should be set so that if the word &apos;plagiarism&apos; occurs, the evaluation kicks off to the staff who investigate the situation and rectify it.   As an educator myself, I know that students plagiarize frequently and think nothing of it.   On the college level, the professional obligation is to educate students not only as to what plagiarism is but also how serious it is by treating it   as a serious ethical offense with consequences.  The lack of response from the professor and the staff is very disappointing and, unfortunately, will lead to more of the same.   I applaud your &apos;perfect&apos; essay, so please see that most of us responding to your plight know your essay is not plagiarized.;I agree that any writer needs to make the reader&apos;s job easier; however, that paragraphs have 3 lines and that not paragraphing about 300 words is an imposition on the reader&apos;s eye is a perception of form that does not jive with the concept of well developed paragraphs.   The demand for &apos;paragraphs of 3 lines (not sentences)&apos; and to &apos;make the format pleasing to the eye&apos; is a result of advertising, television, and other popular media training the present generation to short bursts of information because their attention span is too short for media handled by previous generations.   USA Today began the trend to short bursts which has been followed by our popular newspapers and magazines, but to everyone&apos;s detriment.   Content is then sacrificed to a &apos;pleasing&apos; format.   Brevity is not always the best goal and brevity may even train patience out of readers who refuse to use perseverance to gain worthwhile insights.   Some sense of the history of media and how it shapes our perception of reality as opposed to our shaping it would be most helpful.;</string>
            <string>omg...that half thought that was a whole thought or was it a young thought or a little duck.....mixed metaphors??   Thanks for the laugh before I go to bed!!;</string>
            <string>As a child, my favorite story of the Grimm used to be  One-eye two -eyes and three eyes,  but now is The robber bridegroom; I never before read it and is (if my memory serves me correctly) the first fantasy    story  so really crude  I read.    Leaving aside the good fortune of the girl, I loved the end: the bravery with which she faced the fear that her boyfriend caused her, trying to do the right thing. It&apos;s a message as valuable now as it was then.In any case, it is the first time I scan a literary text as deep as I can and as required by the class, so i have not too much to say yet. Just sharing my fav tale.;</string>
            <string>Jacob,You make a good point, but I was just reading Maria Tatar&apos;s commentary in my annotated version of Snow White. She writes:&quot;Snow White&quot; may vary tremendously from culture to culture in its details, but it has an easily identifiable, stable core in the conflict between mother and daughter. In many versions of the tale, the evil queen is the girl&apos;s biological mother, not a stepmother. The Grimms, in an effort to preserve the sanctity of motherhood, were forever turning biological mothers into stepmothers.  ;</string>
            <string>I think human imagination is always &quot;exploring new territory,&quot; that the space exploration was only one physical (and poorer) manifestation of human&apos;s capacity to create.   without active pursuits to the stars, sci fi in our minds will expand.    ;I totally agree Ryan.I recently mentioned this course to a friend of mine and he said to me &apos;sci-fi is all the same. One guy has just come up with an idea/concept and written about it and others have just done the same thing, but tweaked it&apos;. I was quite surprised to hear him say this. Cos as you say, what was considered to be way out there back in the day is quite the norm today e.g computers, mobile phones etc. And even now I laugh at my parents incapability to send and email or a text message, I&apos;m sure there will be many things that are difficult in today&apos;s world that my kids (whenever I get to havin them) will laugh at me for not being able to do. The world is an ever changing place and so too is sci-fi and fantasy. So bringing it back to the original argument, sci-fi/fantasy has def not lost its awesomeness, it simply has to continually change and evolve, as what was once a fantasy, in many cases becomes a reality. And from these new realities, new fantasies are evolved.;</string>
            <string>It seems to me very important to note the time that a Sci-Fi story was written. If the writer describes a microwave and a cellphone in the 50&apos;s - that&apos;s amazing. Almost prophetic in nature, and it could be argued that Sci-Fi is where we get new technology later on, from the kids who read it when they were young. If you write about a global communications net today, you&apos;re being nothing but derivative. If you wrote about it fifty years ago, it was basically magic. By giving a plausible explanation, you make it that much closer to reality, and a technologist just might be able to take that last step. Case-in-Point, the Star Trek communicators. Those things are why we have cellphones!;To some extent, the word &quot;Fantasy&quot; would apply to absolutely Every work of fiction.;Yes,I agree that both are most certainly fantasy, but not necessarity sci fi.   My favortie dystopian fictions are those by Samuel Delany.   My favorite of his is Babel-17.;That would be amazing! I would take that in a heartbeat.  ;</string>
            <string>I think morality is a great topic to be discussed in reference to Grimm&apos;s tales and I think there are many hidden meanings behind them all, they are not simplystories purely for entertainment value. Fairytales can be somewhat similiar to legends and fables passed down amongst tribes etc The parents or tribe leader would relay a story of the past, whether it be real or not and theis would explain a certian belief that the tribe has perhaps about a certain animal or landmark. It&apos;s a way of teaching their children to beware or something or to respect someone or something, but simply using story form to relay the message. I think Grimm&apos;s fairytales are much the same. I havent read all of them yet, but so far their seems to be a moral or concept or message that they are sharing through each of their stories. ;</string>
            <string>I have a very soft-spot for apocalyptic SF and in some ways it makes life easier for the writer in the same way that claustrophobic SF (e.g. Nonstop, Pandorum) does - it simplifies, removes most of the variables and allows the characters to concentrate on one or a few issues (it is personally really nice to see  Wool  doing so well on the kindle since it merges the two areas nicely). I   suspect that apocalyptic SF emerges at different rates/times depending on the society - there seemed to be a lot of end-of-the-world stuff coming out of Britain around the time(s) it was seeing times of stress as a nation - Wells, Wyndham etc. The cold-war seemed to do the same across nations. Might I suggest that the recent/current economic crisis has perhaps spawned a resurgence in apocalyptic stuff now (particularly zombies)?  ;There seems to be quite a bit in YA novels regarding this subject. I actually really love YA. I&apos;m almost 23 but I still really enjoy them. One of my favorites is The Uglies and the following books by Scott Westerfield. I actually haven&apos;t read any good, modern adult Dystopias lately. They seem to be few and far between and blank, paperback novels at the library tell me nothing.  ;</string>
            <string>Spanish is top of my list of languages to learn, now I&apos;ve got over my school-induced conviction that I &quot;can&apos;t&quot; learn languages.For those of us sad monoglot Anglophones, what would you recommend in translation?;</string>

            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Not erotic? The scene of Harker and the three vampire women follows the plot of many porn movies (with Harker as the pizza delivery boy and the women as hot cheerleaders from a sorority). It even has a fellatio in it.And when Mina sucks Dracula&apos;s chest? Everything in the scene says &quot;blow job&quot;!Lucy wants to have a foursome!The blood transfusion as a metaphor of coitus!All the novel is victorian porn ;-);There are many continuity errors in the novel and ages and time are never clear enough.  Although not age related, the creature says that the De Laceys are extremely poor and later he says that they had servants.It is a very clumsy and poorly written novel with (maybe) an interesting concept. I think Frankenstein is the only example of the movie being best than the book.;It is absolutely boring and poorly written. In fact, there are many beginers&apos;s errors, continuity mistakes and so on.  I find particularly absurd the way that the creature &quot;educates&quot; himself.Also the introduction of the Justine character in Elizabeth&apos;s letter... lamest trick in the beginer writer&apos;s bag.Frankenstein sucks (well, technically it is Dracula who sucks, but he sucks blood, hehehe);</string>
            <string>Yes. The &quot;Written in one night&quot; is a misunderstanding, as giving the name &quot;Frankenstein&quot; to the monster. In one night she wrote a short story and then she filled with stuff until she got a novel lenght. I wonder if it wouldn&apos;t have been better that she had stayed with the original short story, maybe it hasn&apos;t all the filler material the novel has.;All the novel is poorly written, at least under our current standards.The most clumsy example is how Justine is introduced to the readers: Elizabeth, in a letter to Victor, writes &quot;Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history,...&quot; and then proceeds with a clump of information about her. I can&apos;t imagine a more  contrived way to introduce a character than this.Also, I agree with the lack of concern about what happened to the monster after he created it. Victor has one of his drama-queen fits, goes for a walk, and when he finds that the monster is gone he forgets all about him (well, not all, he remembers the needed amount to have one of his too common hysterical attacks).To this I must add that he travels to Britain to interview some colleagues who, we are told, have vital information needed to create the she-monster. One would expect at least to read a conversation with this scientists, but this doesn  t happen at all. What we get from his trip to Britain is a tourist recollection of the places he visited and the landmarks he recomends to other tourists.I can&apos;t figure how this book became a classic.  ;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t think sci-fi has lost its awesomeness potential. It&apos;s just that there are many more people writing it, and all genres, today than there were in the past. So it seems like there are all these terrible or mediocre works, but that&apos;s because of the population writing it. It&apos;s like this: if 5% of the writers of a genre are great, and there are 30 people writing in that genre, it seems like there&apos;s a lot of great work being written and published. But if only 5% of 300,000 are writing great works, then it looks like there&apos;s a lot more...sludge, for lack of a better word, out there, and so people begin to think that the genre itself is to blame...;</string>
            <string>I would argue that there has always been a wide range of &quot;quality&quot;(in any genre, really...). There&apos;s brilliant sci-fi and fantasy, and then of course there is complete schlock. The trick is finding that vein of great writing and thinking. I think that right now there is an impressive group of writers regularly adding to the already rich speculative fiction arena.... I don&apos;t think the state of publishing is such that there is any more cruddy stuff than before (unless you add in self-published ebooks, which does have a higher percentage of cruddiness.... oh, why don&apos;t people see the need for editors?!?).;Ah, now... that&apos;s the trick with written conversation, eh? What you said isn&apos;t what I fully heard... dang it!It&apos;s hard to make sure what we&apos;re thinking is always what comes across. Information has to cross two barriers to understanding (layers of perception... the writer&apos;s mind and then the reader&apos;s mind..)Too bad there aren&apos;t written conventions akin to body language.Ever read &quot;Embassytown&quot; by China Mieville? I haven&apos;t thought about communication the same ever since...;@Nathan &quot;if 5% of the writers of a genre are great, and there are 30 people writing in that genre&quot; ... then there are 1.5 great writers altogether? (Just kidding!)But your point is very interesting. When there was a small market for science-fiction and fa;You might have already mentioned some of  these films, but here&apos;s my contribution anyway:-Metropolis-Fahrenheit 451-1984-Brazil-Equilibrium-The 13th Floor-Dark City-Total recall (both versions)-The Running Man-Tron-Freejack-The Lawnmower Man-Minority Report-Strange Days-Johnny Mnemonic-Screamers-eXistenZ-Videodrome-Nirvana-Gattaca;I did not read the whole tread, but the text says &quot;as big as his head&quot; not &quot;as heavy as his head&quot;. Given that a human head may weight something about as a third (guessing, not going to dignify google with it for now) that would be closer to a 15 kilo (33 pounds) worth of gold. Just saying ...  ;The end of Faithful John immediately reminded me of Medea, though it was quite different....and probably more closely associated to Abraham and Isaac or Agamemnon and Iphigenia.;Cool app! Thanks!;Besides what I&apos;m reading for this and other real courses, I am reading Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. I&apos;m not very far yet, but what I&apos;ve read, I really like.  ;You are like the third person that has recommended The Map of Time. I really must check this out.;Ooooh, visuals! These are great, Katrina!  Here&apos;s some more:Good old Rackham. Here&apos;s a link to many more of his Grimm illustrations:  http://animationresources.org/?p=657I just searched for this Hansel and Gretel image that used to hang in my dentist&apos;s office. I remember staring at it as I waited and I&apos;m sure it influenced a lot of childhood dreams.;My parents read to me a lot when I was younger, but I rarely picked up a book on my own. After they divorced, neither of them had a lot of time to read to me before bed, and I was more against reading on my own than ever, because it required too much effort. I despised most of the books I was forced to read in high school, despite my sister&apos;s help. I was a stereotypical jock, for awhile, and reading was just not cool, anyway. Then, I got to college. My roommate was reading all the time, and wanting to talk about what he was reading with me. He loaned me a few books, like Slaughterhouse 5, The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy, The Lord of the Rings, and The Sun Also Rises. I&apos;ve been an avid reader ever since and even joined a university book club! I have also revisited some of those high school books I hated and come to respect them (if not outright enjoy them). Well, except for Jane Eyre. I will forever hold a grudge against that book. Haha.;I&apos;m kind of surprised at the anger the Grimm tales have caused with some people. First of all, I assumed as fantasy and sci-fi fans, most people had already read them (or at least versions of them). If the stories were so lame and meaningless, why are we still talking about them now? Why have they inspired an unlimited amount of retellings, art, essays, and historical research? I think many people are too quick to judge something that they &apos;hate&apos; or think is pointless before they sit back and think about it on a deeper level. I used to judge things (especially books) too quickly when I was in high school. If I didn&apos;t like a book by the first few pages, I dismissed it as worthless. Now, though, I have learned to give things a bigger chance. There&apos;s a lot to be gleaned from the fairy tales, and all the other readings in this course if you give them all a fair chance.;Few people study the books that present a perfect world in which every character gets along with every other character, no one is judgmental, and there are no conflicts. There&apos;s nothing to be learned from them! By reading literature that contains controversial issues, we can examine the changes of our world, positive and negative, and become more accepting individuals ourselves. Look at this as a learning experience.;Karen:I was not saying that conflict means violence. Where did you get that? I meant, that any kind of controversial concept adds much to the reading (and without it, would be boring). Language, character attitudes, stereotypes, society, perspective or perception, etc.  Kate:Bear in mind, these books, or many of them, were written in a different time. People thought differently, society was different, etc. And though some would disagree with me, I think we have come a long way when it comes to prejudice and bigotry. It is still out there, though and just this fact alone makes it worthwhile to read books with bigotry displayed so that we can understand it from a variety of perspectives. And challenge it ourselves. That is the power of individuality. We don&apos;t need to be told by some disclaimer at the beginning of every book what to think. We have the ability to do it on our own.;Agreed. Plain and simple.;</string>
            <string>This is an excellent dialog all around! Cheers for all the comments so far. I have been lurking and reading the thread.  In regards to the SF/F split (what makes something Sci-Fi and what makes something Fantasy) I think it is not so clear. Casey mentions that maybe this is similar to the split between science and religion, that science attempts to explain how everything is done while religion looks at it with awe and wonder. While this is a good point to bring up, I respectfully disagree to an extent. For instance, there is a lot of awe and wonder in science and a lot of trying to explain the why and wherefores in religion (though typically through methods quite different than the scientific method).  I speculate here, but indulge me a bit...is the main difference between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that the former incorporates technology and the latter incorporate magic? Somebody brought up Frankenstein. This is a wonderful example. Is this Sci-Fi? Is this Fantasy? Is this both? Does it matter?  ;Bryant,I know the creators of Grimm Fairytales personally. I think they have some great ideas in their fairy tale re-workings, but it is sometimes difficult to get past the scantily clad women with gigantic bosoms. : /Incidentally, &quot;Fairest&quot; is wonderful! In fact, I haven&apos;t come across a single spin-off or storyline that I dislike in the Fables series.;I definitely agree with the philosophy. It&apos;s a great medium for abstract thought and ideas. It&apos;s just because of the history of comics. I watched a documentary on the history of comics once. It was really enlightening and showed just how much they struggled just to make their superheroes when the rest of the world scorned them. They did follow the trend of the cheap paperback novels in terms of mystery, western, sci fi with a damsel in distress. That sort of thing. I&apos;ll have to find it again, I&apos;ll post the link when I do. I think I may have watched in on Netflix, come to think of it.;Dystopian societies are everywhere in sci-fi books.   It is a common plot for a character to live in a dystopian society, which in some way they have to make better. Hunger Games is a good example of the Utopian/Dystopian relationship.;Audiobooks aren&apos;t cheating, but I think they hurt more then help.   Audiobooks allow us to hear emotion with the words, but reading helps us better understand how a certain alliteration can convey this type of feeling or this personification gives us a certain imagery.;Besides Grimm, I just finished &quot;The Gate Thief&quot; by Orson Scott Card and &quot;Wild Cards I&quot; by George R.R. Martin.   I&apos;m kind of studying &quot;Bulfinch&apos;s Mythology&quot;.;I definitely want to read &quot;The Fall of Arthur&quot;!;</string>
            <string>It&apos;s stories like this that make you wonder if the Grimms were deeply religious or simply  misogynists.   You notice that in many of their stories such as Snow White maidens are young naive girls who fall into temptation like in Adam and Eve.   Women on the other hand are fueled by sin.   The Snow White Queen was fueled by Envy  and Pride, The mother in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and  the hen in &quot;The Death of the Hen&quot;    and the wife in &quot;The fisherman and his Wife&quot;(?) were fueled by Greed.;I honestly think the Grimm brothers were trying to emulate the original sin of temptation in Adam and Eve along with the blatant misogyny within their writings. &quot;Maidens&quot; within Grimm writings are young, naive, and can easily fall to temptation, like in the Rabbit&apos;s Bride, or when Snow White takes the poisoned apple.   Women and Mother figures are usually seen as sinful and take actions based on their sins.   The Evil Queen tries to kill Snow out of envy and the fisherman&apos;s wife made her husband make extravagant wishes out of greed.   Their sins motivate them and consumes them.   Then their is the rare heroine that does not defeat any opponent through combat or valor, but through sheer endurance of a bad situation (i.e. Cinderella).   ;</string>
            <string>I found almost all the books on Kindle.   It took some work to find the right edition by using the ISBN numbers.   These books match up pretty much exactly to what the professor linked.   I found them all on Amazon.ca, but I imagine .com is basically the same thing.The first book, &quot;Household Stories by the Brothers Grimm&quot;, matches up with the Kindle Edition Nov. 1, 2012, published by Dover Publications.   It costs about $9, but it&apos;s the same one that he links on the web page.   There is a free version as well, but not quite the same.  https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00A73FR3A/ref=kinw_myk_ro_titleAlice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (Oxford World&apos;s Classics) is Kindle Edition Sept. 10th, 2009.   It cost $3.50.   https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00BHGNXUA/ref=kinw_myk_ro_titleHe linked free web version of Dracula and Frankenstein.   You can also find various free and paid  Kindle versions.   I think both web pages that he linked have an option to download .mobi (Kindle) versions.&quot;Twice Told Tales&quot; and &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse and other stories&quot; are both free on Amazon.cahttps://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00849KVJY/ref=kinw_myk_ro_titlehttps://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0082Z1FCC/ref=kinw_myk_ro_titleThe link for the &quot;Portable Poe&quot; is in .pdf and you can put that on a Kindle, but I have no idea what it will look like.   In my experience .pdf on a Kindle looks like crap.   The Kindle version costs $18.99, but it is by Penguin Books.   I am thinking about buying it.It looks like the link he posted for the Wells books leads to downloadable versions compatible with the Kindle (and other devices).   I was also looking at &quot;Complete Works of H.G. Wells (Illustrated)&quot; for $2.99.   There looks to be quite a few complete works in the series.   I haven&apos;t had a look inside yet, so I&apos;m not sure how organized it is.   Just about anybody can post a book, so sometimes it&apos;s hit and miss.   I also found &quot;Country of the Blind and other Stories&quot; published by Penguin Classics for $9.75.http://www.amazon.ca/Complete-Works-Wells-Illustrated-ebook/dp/B004TCVHNE/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=3PVD6H4R1E9C8&amp;coliid=I1XRJFLZK4HUXUhttp://www.amazon.ca/Country-Selected-Stories-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI9CUM/ref=tmm_kin_title_2http://www.amazon.ca/Invisible-Pocket-Penguin-Classics-ebook/dp/B002RI92O8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=3PVD6H4R1E9C8&amp;coliid=I3QGER8UD66Y33He has links to both  Burroughs &amp; Gilman books and there are downloadable versions for both.

            <string>Thank you very much! It never occurred to me to search by ISBN. It&apos;ll take me a little while to look through all of those things you posted -- I really appreciate you linking them to me! I&apos;ve just never been very good at research -- I get overwhelmed and miss stuff a lot. It looks like print copies are covered, which is fantastic. Unfortunately, while I was sure it would, I haven&apos;t been able to figure out how to make my kindle read to me yet.... I&apos;ll just have to keep trying. Thank you so much again!;</string>
            <string>Ol  ,My name is Isaura Silva and I&apos;m from Portugal.This is my first course, hope to learn a lot.I&apos;m a high school teacher and I want to learn new things to break up monotony of the daily life.;</string>
            <string>Ol  !I&apos;m Carla and I&apos;m also from Portugal! :)Is is nice to know someone else from my country is also taking this class!;Is there someone from   Italy?We can build a study group!;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m from Salsomaggiore Terme (Parma), but living in Edinburgh now.;Edinburgh is a very nice city if you want to have an experience abroad. Apart from being amazingly beautiful, it is neither too big nor too small. And it&apos;s lovely during the summer. :);zona lambrate, tu?;Saluto tutti gli italiani del corso. Facciamoci onore.Per i milanesi e dintorni: anch&apos;io sono di Milano, abito in zona Corvetto. Potremmo farci una pizza assieme e conoscerci. Mi chiamo Giuseppe e sono pensionato.;Penso ceh si potrebbe fare: date possibili? Io sar _ sicuramente disponibile fino all fine di giugno.;</string>
            <string>allora abitiamo proprio vicine :) qualche volta si potrebbe studiare insieme (tipo quando non capir _ nulla delle lezioni e degli esercizi!!!). Voi cosa fate nella vita?;</string>
            <string>Dai si potrebbe organizzare ;);</string>
            <string>Io personalmente preferisco un posto economico dato che sopravvivo con una borsa di studio, se il ristorante non    carissimo (al massimo dui 20 euro) per me non ci sono problemi (non so poi quali siano le disponibilit   economiche delle altre persone del gruppo). Altrimenti si potrebbe provare una pizzeria. Dato che Andrea    in zona abbiategrasso e maria loreto penso che rimanere verso colonne/porta genova potrebbe non essere troppo scomodo. Io sto fra lambrate e udine come zona ma non    un problema, mi metto in metro e arrivo: l&apos;unica cosa che al momento non riesco a fare a causa di un problema al ginocchio    camminare per lunghe distanze ma finch   posso andare con i mezzi o comunque fare tratti a piedi non troppo lunghi non c&apos;   problema sul luogo per me.Sinceramente in quella zona non conosco tantissime pizzerie: c   un rossopomodoro proprio vicino alle colonne oppure una pizzeria che si chiama &quot;willy&quot; fra S. Agostino e porta ticinese (in via papiniano), sono due catene quindi nulla di eccelso ma la pizza    buona e di solito c&apos;   abbastanza spazio (specialmente da willy che    un posto abbastanza grande) cos   se ci vediamo di sabato sera che ci sar   un sacco di gente in giro almeno non rischiamo di rimanere fuori! Se per _ conoscete posti migliori proponete!!!;Allora io butterei l  : sabato 23 alle 19:30 alla pizzeria Willy in piazza Cantore 4 (circa 400 metri da S. Agostino- linea verde). ovviamente non voglio decidere per tutti, modifichiamo pure luogo e orario (e giorno): solo che visto che dobbiamo metterci d&apos;accordo senza esserci mai visti penso che sia meglio partire da un appuntamento fissato e poi magari cambiare se qualcuno non pu _ piuttosto che perdere mille anni rimanendo sul vago. Se conoscete posti migliori non esitate a proporre!!! (Maria, tu ti uniresti a noi? Se non sai dov&apos;   il posto possiamo andare insieme da Loreto);</string>
            <string>Oh boy, can I relate to that, Martha...!In a nerdy vein, I would suggest a kind of XML-based model of the course, that specifies types of assignment, dates, etcetera, that is part of a central course definition template. It should flag when each of the values has (or has not) been changed once the course cycles over.  ;</string>
            <string>As a result, some of the &quot;goslings&quot; story doesn&apos;t make sense - why would the wolf make his paws white to fool the goslings, but it would make sense to fool young goats.;Marla - exactly where I went - to the five Chinese brothers - one of my favorite children&apos;s books and I still have it (will have to reread).   Martha Ellen;Emma - on the begin careful of judging others - that brings to mind the 5 blind men and the elephant.   Martha Ellen;Was an assignment link ever posted?   I keep expecting an assignment link to show up on the navigation bar to the left.;1.   Kindred by Octavia E Butler - time travel meets race relations and slavery in the South2.   Ready, Player One by Ernest Cline - futuristic dystopia mixed with flashback to the 80s, likeable hero3.   Ender&apos;s Game by Orson Scott Card - simplistic future world with child hero, ripe for many discussions4.   The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalup - calories become a commodity, seed banks are essential5.   Y, The Last Man by Brian K. Vaughn and Pia Guerra - graphic comic, great visuals, many openings for discussion;Students without sight rely on audio editions (whether recorded or read live).   Every version of a book, whether a different translation, a recording or just a rereading of a book after many years reveals different aspects of the work.   I think this is why it is important that we reread all the words for this course even if we have read them in the past, because the rereading will reveal more than we remember and not just because of memory but also because we have changed in that time.I would assume that for a literature course, reviewing analyses before and after reading would be essential.   I personally prefer to not have spoilers, but tend to read analyses in parallel with the reading.However, there are many different ways to experience writing, and I believe all are valid.;Depending on the translation and the edition of tales used in the translation, the word little would show more or less often.   My reading of the history of Grimms&apos; tales is that the original written record of oral tradition was intended for other scholars.   As children began to be common readers of the tales, the Grimms added diminutives, moral endings and religious references in subsequent editions to be able to market to a larger audience.   They also diminished the sexual content (see various versions of Rapunzel) over time.I&apos;m surprised that &quot;three&quot; is not larger.;Christopher, the word cloud is visually appealing and interesting.    Very nice idea.   What text did you use to make it?   Does Wordle allow you to consolidate conjugations of verbs and consolidate noun forms, such as plurals, possessives and singulars?   One thing that does not show is how often words, phrases or episodes are repeated.   I think the repetitions in threes are underrepresented in the word cloud.Cheers, Martha Ellen;The red/black/white imagery does echo the theme of threes.   There seems to be another with silver/gold/steel.I wonder whether red symbolizes blood which in turn symbolizes lost of purity.   For instance, the pricking of a finger results in red blood.   Is that just a symbol for the blood shed when virginity is lost?Remember all those Westerns where the good man is in white and the bad in black?   Retelling of fairy tales?   And red in those movies represented the woman of low morals.;I was wondering that myself.   I didn&apos;t writing something down that Dr. Rabkin had said and then I wanted to find it again later.   I couldn&apos;t remember which video it was in and didn&apos;t want to relisten to them all.   Being able to do a text search on the lecture would be so much easier.As someone who had difficulty listening, I use the closed captions during the lectures.   I appreciate being able to speed up the lecture since I read faster than I can listen, but I still get the facial expressions and gestures of the speaker.   However, I find the captions don&apos;t appear at the same time as they are spoken.   Makes for interesting (sometimes difficult) experiences.   It helps with spelling and understanding of words or names that I wouldn&apos;t be able to understand with only spoken language.;When we grade/comment on others work, is it done anonymously (i.e., blind to their identity)?   I am used to putting the typical header in MLA style documentation (My name, Course, Instructor name, date), and I am wondering whether I should omit my name.   Thanks,   Martha Ellen;Several numbers show up, although not as often as 3:   2 (couples, birds on Cinderella&apos;s shoulders, giants to be slain), 7 (7 goslings or goats, dwarves), 12 (brothers).   I asked a German professor friend who has read the tales in German (but not sure which iteration of the tales - the ones meant for other scholars or the ones tamed down for children).   Her response was that the numbers had magical qualities rather than religious.   There is the adage that when teaching you repeat something 3 times for someone to learn/remember it.   There could be a little of that theory behind the repetition of phrases or words 3 times in the tales, especially since these stories are supposed to be written records of oral tradition.   Three is generally a nice number - not too many and not too few.;Just thought of this.   In art there is a &quot;rule of odds&quot; that says a composition is more visually interesting if there are an odd number of items.   The theory is that in an even number the viewer automatically pairs items and then stops thinking about the piece.   With an odd number of items, the viewer is constantly rearranging the pieces in the mind and the interest in the piece lasts longer.   Could the same be true of literature?And another thing about 3 in a mathematical sense:   we tend to look for patterns in lists that are 3 or more long, while in lists of 2 we only compare and contrast.   So, by having a surprise appear in the third item in a list, we have developed a certain expectation that we would not have if the surprise is in the second item in the list.   On the other hand, having the surprise in the fourth item in a list would be too late - the pattern is established and the surprise would be jarring instead of pleasant.Cheers.   ;Thank you, Brian.   And Marla, thanks for confirming my theory about the 4th item in a list.   I wondered if it was just me.;The problem summary:   This isn&apos;t a problem as much as a suggestion.   I particularly like the course calendar (and the printable versions that other students have made available).   See link to calendar below.   However, it would be useful to have a checkbox beside each item in the list so I could keep track for myself what I have done and not done.   This is available on Moodle and I&apos;m afraid that I have become addicted to using it (See example screen shot below).   I can easily see that I need to still finish Quiz Day 12 but have done the other two requirements).Thanks.Link:   https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseCalendarScreen shot example:   ;I am a book blogger and am used to writing a post about each book I read and posting reviews on various book websites like LibraryThing and Amazon.Is it a violation of the academic integrity of the course if I post a blog entry or write a review during the course or do I need to schedule the posts to appear after the course is over?   While taking a literature course, the content of my blog post and my essays (or other assignments) are very closely related, and often the blog post is a draft of what I plan to submit.Please let me know and I will act accordingly so that I abide by the requirements of the academic integrity of the course.Thank you,  Martha Ellen;Hello, I have been waiting for an assignment link to appear on the left with all the other links (to Home, Course Information, etc.)   I see that the due date for the first assignment has passed already, but frankly I didn&apos;t know where to submit it.(Also, would prefer the due date to be 12 noon or 12 midnight, assumed 12 pm was midnight instead of noon)Thanks for help on this issue.Martha Ellen;A link would be helpful.   Locating all other information about the course seems intuitive except submitting assignments.Thanks for the information.;Is that the only place to find the assignments?   I have been tending to come to the pages directly to the forums from my e-mail notifications, and that right-hand notification bar does not appear there.   I assumed you could access all course materials from the left-hand bar - something that showed up on all pages.   Thanks for the information.;Glad to know I&apos;m not alone.  ;I would like to get feedback on my essay even if it doesn&apos;t count for the class.   I&apos;m going to put another forum post out for those that missed the deadline.   Maybe we can share between us and get feedback that way.;For those of us who missed the submission deadline (either because we assumed 12pm was midnight instead of noon, or because there is no assignments link on the left-hand navigation bar (at least none say Assignments)):Could we find some way to share among ourselves so that we can at least get some feedback?   Say, make a deadline of 12 midnight EDT tonight.   How could we do the sharing so that the essays are distributed equally?   Thoughts?Also, I have found out from others that the assignment link is hidden on the left-hand-side navigation panel under Peer Responses (I assumed that would be where we would go after submitting assignments, and not to submit the assignment itself).;Sounds easy to do, Vignesh.;Vignesh,   I thought the deadline was midnight tonight to begin with.   My post will be up later this evening.   :);Agree, Ritu.   We students should help each other with reminders in the forums.   Thanks for your comments, Olena.   I applaud all of those who were willing to post their essays here where it is not anonymous.I am sure that constructive criticism for the essays below would be welcome from anyone.;I agree that the stories often divide personality traits of one person into different characters in the story, and in fact, that was part of my argument.I agree with Samantha on form.   I could clearly identify your thesis, and the sentence structure and style made reading easy.   On the other hand, paragraph structure would have aided the reader and some word choice was unusual enough (depictive) to require a second reading of some paragraphs (in fact, depictive is not in my computer&apos;s dictionary).As for content, you state what you believe the symbols mean, but do not provide arguments for each.   At 278 words (by MS Word&apos;s count) there was room for expansion of some of your ideas.   I also suspect that you choice of imagery may have drawn on cultural references that not everyone is aware of, and so another option for expansion might have been to put the references into context for the reader.Thanks for sharing your essay, Vignesh, and here is to hoping that we all meet the deadline in the future.;I appreciated the evidence provided from the text.   It is my experience with students that they are willing to make a claim, but not always able to provide references to substantiate the claim, but this essay does that nicely.However, in the last paragraph there is a universal claim that only three types of people change Fate.   I am reminded of something Dr. Rabkin said in his introductory lectures:   seek out counterexamples.   I suspect that examples of people who can change Fate can be found other than those you have stated.   If so, then the claim is weakened.The writing is well done and easy to read.   Well done.;Andres, first a comment on your writing.   Even before I reached your final statement, I suspected that you were not a native speaker of English, and the types of mistakes that you made are the counterparts of the mistakes I make when I am writing in Spanish.   Your paragraph structure is well done, and the mistakes are with close-homonyms like tale (a noun) and tell (a verb) and other word forms like prove (a verb) instead of proof (a noun) and ethnics for ethnicities.   A spell-checker alone will not catch these word substitutions.   I have no other recommendation other than asking a native English speaker to read over your essays if possible.The thesis of a dichotomy is well stated and the second paragraph helps provide an argument.   However, the essay wandered from the thesis into the concept of story-telling and the oral tradition.   The connection between that and the thesis could be strengthened.Esta bien.   Buena suerte en la clase.    ;Kathy, thank you for submitting your essay in this public forum.The essay has strong sentence and paragraph structure.   As for the word count comment above, MS Word counted 319 words, the same number I used in my essay and within the 280-320 count required, so that does not seem to be a problem at all.The argument is on point with specific evidence to justify the claims.   However, for such a short essay, a three-part thesis is ambitious.   While a good essay, it could be improved by focusing more on one point and expanding the explanations in the argument.Well done, and see you around the forum.;I agree, Stephanie.   I had expected a staff member to chime in here sometime, and possibly some action taken.   However, I am excited that those of us who made a good-faith effort to meet the deadline were willing to share their work in this public, not anonymous forum.   Short of increased clarity in the website structure, we can help each other with reminders on the forum for when and how to submit the next essay.Cheers.;Okay, in the nick of time:The stories in Crane   s book are from the Grimms         Household Tales    so-called because they entertained and enlightened the family during time-consuming household labors.   Relayed by adults to adults and children, the tales sketch the characteristics of individuals and groups that are necessary for familial solidarity, an essential ingredient for survival at the time.  Several tales use one-dimensional characters to describe two sides of a single personality. The huntsman in Little Red-cap provides protection for the women while the wolf endangers their purity and their lives.   These characters depict the contradictory impulses of a single man, who protects the household but is subject to physical desires.     This model is repeated with pairs of kind and evil (step)mothers, as in Rapunzel and Cinderella.     The two tales Mother Hulda and The Three Little Men in the Wood describe the dichotomy of motivations for children.   These stories portray two children of polar opposites but can be used to help a child understand their own conduct, and for the health of the family, help to modify his or her behavior toward some middle ground.     We see in The Bird, the Mouse and the Sausage the necessity for the members of the household to contribute to the common effort based on their talents, and sketches the calamity that might arise from perceived inequities and inappropriate roles.   It can also be argued that the choice of non-humans as members of the household was intended to facilitate discussion among family members whose talents do not follow the stereotypical gender roles.   Tales like The Bremen Town Musicians stress the value of synergy of multiple strengths, while Cat and Mouse in Partnership warn against an unequal relationship.  Through the elemental parts, the complexity of personalities and collaboration are explained. Thus, one purpose of the stories, told around the hearth, was to strengthen relationships and understand to enable the household to prosper against the vagaries of economics, environment and society.    ;Mark, thank you for submitting your essay.   I hope others provide feedback for you as well.As for structure, this is well written with good form and style.    I&apos;m not well-versed in this type of writing to know if a question can serve as a thesis or not, and would like others to weigh in on that.   That said, the question the power of choice calls to mind the question of free will and worthy of discussion.Adequate evidence is provided in the argument.   However, I would like to know more about ending an essay with a question as well.   I like to raise questions myself but am just wondering whether it is appropriate for this format of writing.Well done.;</string>
            <string>Thanks for your comments!   I have enjoyed reading everyone&apos;s essays here and have found them and the responses to my writing instructional.   I hope that I was able to incorporate ideas for improving essays into the one I wrote on Alice in Wonderland, which I have already submitted!   A little gun shy about missing the deadline again.Thanks again!;Victor,Thank you for submitting your essay in this forum, especially since it helped me see something about the gosling&apos;s tale that I had not seen before.   I have been very interested in the bilateral symmetry of images, such as the light/dark symbols that you mention, but I had not thought of the digestive/sexual dichotomy before, even though some had referred to the cutting of the goslings from the wolf&apos;s belly as a rebirth, your explanation makes that more clear to me.If your essay were to be improved, it would be through using paragraphs and white space to help the reader navigate the writing.   Practically all writing we do in the context of this course is persuasive writing - we are trying to persuade the reader to engage with the ideas, but first we have to get the reader to read.   The first view of the writing is how it appears on the page, and by making the image of the words on the page welcoming is the first step in capturing the reader&apos;s attention.   Very nice work, and I hope to see more of your ideas in the course.Cheers!;Karin,   Thanks for submitting your ideas.   I agree with Kathy that for this to be marked well as an essay, closer attention needs to be paid to the sentence structure and spelling.It was interesting, though, to look at the tales as a whole.   There are several points in your writing that could be developed into a short essay, especially the power and purpose of the oral tradition.   On the other hand, the assignments are short and must be focused.   I think it is hard for many of us as writers of longer pieces and used to looking at the big picture to write such brief, concentrated works.Strong ideas, Karin, and thanks for submitting your work in this forum.Cheers!;Connie,Thanks for submitting your essay in this forum.   You make a good point that using animals in the tales helps explain the lessons in an objective way.   This sort of storytelling is common and we are still taught as teachers to distance ourselves from the student and focus on the work to help relay a message in an objective, non-threatening way.   You provide evidence for your thesis by focusing on two stories and their lessons.   I appreciated your take on those two stories.If the essay were to be improved, I would recommend a close proof-reading of the essay, possible enlisting the help of a friend.   The well-considered ideas expressed can be strengthened by tightening up the grammar and style.Nice work.Cheers!;Kathryn, A well-written essay that describes a specific symbol from the stories - the forest - and the role it plays in children&apos;s lives.   Specifically the move from the safety of childhood and home and the passage to adulthood where they must forge on their own.If the essay were to be improved, it might be to make a closer analogy of the creatures and dangers of the forest to the hazards that the children will face as they grow up.   What do the creatures represent, both the kind and the not so kind?   For a short essay like this, specificity is important.Thanks for sharing your essay.   The ideas you used here are very similar to those I used when writing about Alice, only in her case I talked about her moving from childhood&apos;s self-centeredness to being more aware of the perspectives of others after her journey.Cheers!;Alice is a deconstructionist at heart. As are most children.   I haven&apos;t outgrown my own joy of wordplay (much to the chagrin of my colleagues, friends and family).   ;I agree with Goldy.   As someone else has said in the forum, seeing the movies or listening to an audible version of Alice makes it difficult to understand all the word play.   I would suspect that someone for which English is not their first language would also struggle with the wordplay.   Another barrier to enjoying the books are the references that are specific to Victorian England, Oxford and even the Liddell family.   Having read other Victorian literature has helped, but I still had to look up some ideas to help with the humor.I had never really enjoyed the film versions of the books, but now that I have read them, thanks for the requirement for this course, I have a lot more appreciation for the writing.   A last recommendation for getting more from the books is to remember the intended audience - children, specifically girls. I think about current books for children, especially something like Captain Underpants, which is intended for young boys, and while I don&apos;t personally appreciate the scatological humor in the book, I can understand how a young boy would enjoy it.   A problem, though, is that the references in Alice are too specific to the time to be totally enjoyable to a child of today, but keeping that perspective is helpful in enjoying the books for what they are.;I second the recommendation of the Phantom Tollbooth.   One of my favorites and a perennial read for me.;I have always been aware of the overt references to Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass, but now having read the books for the first time I am amazed at the more implicit ones.   It is amazing how this unassuming mathematics lecturer, Dodgson, has made such a significant impact on the literature and culture of the English-speaking world.   Questions:   Does that impact exist in countries where other languages dominate?How pervasive is the influence on current pop culture?;</string>
            <string>However, we are not reading the same texts.   For instance, some read the annotated Alice and others did not, and so information from Gardner&apos;s annotations was not common knowledge.   The same can be said for any background information, for example, the biographical information in the anthologies I am taking some of the reading from.Also, citations and references are two different things.   Citations are what are done in the text (i.e., (Grimm 22)) and references are what are listed on the Works Cited page of a document or in the box we are given for works cited.   The quote that Joshua gives says that the contents of the common knowledge of the course does not require citations, but it does NOT say that it does not require references.   It is good practice to learn what much be cited and what doesn&apos;t in the context of the specific audience, but personally to err on the side of over-citation.   In my case, when I am reading another&apos;s essay, if there is something that I don&apos;t remember from the reading, the in-text citation gives me the ability to find the reference for myself if needed for further understanding.   ;I like your analogy as well and have thought about it often.   As a mathematics professor (who also teaches some art) I think that students should be able to transfer their knowledge of how to structure a mathematical argument to other disciplines, but it is harder for them to do than I imagined.   Realizing that an argument in literature is not as cut and dried as some mathematical proofs, I still wish I could teach them to use what they know from math in my art classes whether they are justifying the meaning their work.;Laura, I have seen quotes around single words in many of the essays I have read.   I agree that they are not needed.   Martha Ellen;Three sisters - again.   It seems to be a common thread in our reading.;I realize that Dr. Rabkin said  &quot;In our community, the readings, my videos, and your postings may be considered &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Their contents do not require citation in this course.&quot;However, there is a difference between in-text citations and references.   I recognize that for a specific audience you must assume a specific knowledge base.   For example, in my field I would never cite the quadratic formula because it is common knowledge in mathematics.   Dr. Rabkin provides us with very specific content for what our community considered common knowledge.But providing a specific reference to the work that was read for the essays is important.   We are not all reading the same edition:   some read the annotated Alice and some did not, not all translations of the Grimms&apos; tales were the same, etc.   Stating in the Works Cited the specific edition that was read as the reference used, even when implicit citations are used, is important, both for clarifying the source but also for giving credit to annotators and translators for their intellectual property.Furthermore, the annotations, biographical information, footnotes, etc., that are particular to each edition is not common reading.   If information is taken from those sources, they need to have in-text citations.Dr. Rabkin did not give us free license to ignore citations altogether.   And using both in-text citations plus the references on the Works Cited are both important.Sorry about coming off sternly, but as an educator, I find that students find providing appropriate credit to the intellectual property of others very difficult.   This is precisely that type of course where this should be practiced to improve that ability.;Some people have worried about the in-text citation from eating up their word count and were choosing not to use them for the recommended edition, but I don&apos;t see any problems with using in-text citations for the book everyone is reading.   I also don&apos;t see any problem with being a little over the word count if there are in-text citations knowing that is where the extra is.;This is an example of an MLA in-text citation.   It is placed in the document where the intellectual property of someone else is used.The references are the works that are cited from and appear on the Works Cited page.   ;I only used MLA in the example I gave because that is what was handy for me.   I was just trying to distinguish between in-text citations and references.   While all documentation styles do each differently, all documentation styles have both.;The biggest issue is giving credit to others for their intellectual property.   It may be too much to ask for in this class for everyone to use a specific format, especially when there hasn&apos;t been intentional instruction as to what the format is.   Since the grading is left to peer review, and we all come from different backgrounds, it is impossible to assume that we will all use a single format.   I expect this to get very contentious as we go along, but am curious about how it all works as an educator who teaches on-line courses myself and would like to use peer review.I also assume that citations are required, not just for quotes but for any information taken from another author.   In my own classes, if a student does not cite others work then our institution&apos;s policy is that I can fail the student for plagiarism.   I wouldn&apos;t do so if it is a teachable moment and if the student&apos;s writing did not claim the information as his or her own and learned from that point for the future.However, in this class there is an assumption stated by Dr. Rabkin on what is common knowledge.   Therein lies the rub.   How do we interpret this?;I&apos;m in both.   The reading for Relationships is taking longer than this one.   But I find Dr. Rabkin&apos;s lectures more interesting.   We will be looking at other relationships.   Kafka&apos;s include a working relationship, and The Ice Palace is a relationship between children, and possibly children and their parents.   I keep comparing the readings of the two courses and feel I am able to take what I learn from one and apply it to the other.  ;</string>
            <string>I wish I had been assigned to read your essay - this is an interesting observation (one I was interested in pursuing myself) and I would have liked to have read the essay.;Kevin, I thought that almost all the way through the book.   Even though Walton wrote that there had been a figure on the ice before Frankenstein showed up, I put that down to mirage or to seeing Frankenstein twice with some optical distortion the first time.   It almost seemed that Frankenstein let Justine die because he couldn&apos;t tell about the monster because in his subconscious he knew the monster did not really exist.The nested narration, that the creature never had its own name, and that the creature became so well-read and well-spoken all led me to this conclusion.   In a way, I thought about this like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde - that in Frankenstein&apos;s experiments he caused his psyche to split into the creature and a shell.   The creature was able to feel much more than Frankenstein could, but that it wasn&apos;t his appearance that drove people off, but rather the depth to which he felt was too much for other people.   Even at the end, I thought that Walton was talking to the other half of Frankenstein and that it was his spirit that was trying to leave through the window.;</string>

Just never wanted to stop learning.;No one has said anything negative about Kindle locations in my citations either.   It seems to be acceptable in this community.;Anon, I&apos;m sorry that you find in-text citations distracting, but they are the standard, as least in this class.   Otherwise we should be using subscripts.   The list of books in the works cited list are references, not citations.   Citations appear in the essay itself to show exactly where quotes or ideas were used that are someone else&apos;s intellectual property.   Without in-text citations, the casual reader would not know which of the statements you make in the essay you are claiming are your and which you are attributing to someone else.;I&apos;m having trouble rectifying Aylmer&apos;s behavior with the Victorian Era.   Of course women are objectified in this era, and so is his seeing her as an object to &quot;fix&quot; out of the ordinary at the time?;Agreed, Elizabeth.   The main points missed by most people about peer evaluation is what they should be getting out of it by doing it.   By reading other essays, we get to see others&apos; arguments.   I find that reading essays are more useful to me than many of the forums because someone had to distill an argument down to 320 words or less, and so the writing is potent.But the peer reviewing itself is a critical thinking exercise - practice in following an argument, trying to think of counterexamples, etc.   And then there is the practice is writing constructive criticism.   I don&apos;t know if it is the luck of the draw, the reduced number of people actively engaged in the course over time, or that people are getting better at reviewing, but the reviews I have gotten from others have improved significantly since the beginning.   The criticisms I got the last two times have been useful to me.   Also the number of reviews I have gotten have increased (first 3, then 4 and finally 5).   I&apos;m eager to see how good the critiques will become.;As pointed out on another thread, the scores are medians, not means.   So all of the following would result in a 2 on either form or content:1, 1, 2, 3, 3      median = 2, mean = 22, 2, 2, 2, 2      median = 2, mean = 22, 2, 2, 3, 3      median = 2, mean = 2.41, 1, 2, 2, 2      median = 2, mean = 1.6A score of 4.5 means that you got a 2 on one part and a 2.5 on the other.   To get a 2.5 there were an even number of scores and half were 2s and half were 3s (e.g., 2, 2, 3, 3).So... my point is that we can&apos;t tell from getting 2s whether someone gave us some 3s or not.   It also means we don&apos;t know if we got 1s or not.Note that 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 would result in a 3.   :);Maybe rose colored drinks?;I&apos;ve been publishing my essays, in some form or another and with additional information, on my blog, scheduled to be published after the evaluations are over:   http://murphyslaw58.blogspot.com/Thanks to everyone who gave their blog address above.

I have a love of etymology and so am excited to hear him use etymology to explain connections and history.   I admit to trying to think of essay topics that I think he will tell us about later - like a game.   For the essay for Frankenstein I read and peer reviewed 10 essays.   I was intrigued to find out what others had written about.And I&apos;m spending way too much time reading and commenting on the forum.   :)   It takes away time from reading!;Is it a requirement that the essays be written in English?   Maybe for non-native English speakers there is an option whether they can self-identify the language they want to use.   It seems to that there a plenty of Spanish speakers here that they could give feedback for essays written in their own language and give the feedback in their own language.   Maybe also true of speakers of other languages.   Maybe Coursera will offer this option in the future.  Es necesario que los ensayos ser escrito en ingl  s?

To recognize paragraphs you need a blank line between each one.   After pasting into the Coursera editor, just put a blank line between each paragraph.   It is a small bit of editing after pasting, but it will be worth it for clarity to the readers.;Birthmarks might be considered a scar from a past life, something that scared the mother or a craving by the mother that wasn&apos;t satisfied.   Any thoughts of the connection between folklore and Hawthorne&apos;s story?;From the Work Expectations page a 2 is a pass.   You would have to be getting 1 (1 + 0) or less for a fail.   Also, only the highest 7 grades count.   (Which makes me feel less upset about missing the first assignment because I misread the deadline.)If you accumulate six or fewer submissions, regardless of the grades you received, you will not have earned a Statement of Accomplishment.   If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment.   If, though, five average 2 and two average 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.7 and will not have earned your Statement of Accomplishment.   However, you have ten opportunities to submit your work and only the seven highest submissions contribute to your average.   Therefore, if your essay grades fall down a bit, don   t worry; just try your best on the next week   s work.   If you achieve six essays averaging 2 on Form and Content and at least one more essay, even if that takes you ten weeks to accomplish, you truly will have earned your Statement of Accomplishment because, through that process, you will have learned much yourself and contributed much to the learning of others.   That is an accomplishment of which you can feel proud.;One thing this course does not have is a way to improve writing by getting feedback on rough drafts of the writing.   I for one would like to do this.   How?   I suspect people aren&apos;t willing to post their essays before the deadline - it would be a way for someone to simply copy the essay into their own assignment page - what is the likelihood that at random the person who originally wrote the essay would see it in the feedback stage or that one person would get two identical essays to grade?So, again, how?;I like the analysis of voice, and I didn&apos;t research enough to know that the &quot;pen name&quot; was related to Hawthorne&apos;s name.   Well written and I learned something.   Reading this and knowing what my thoughts were during the reading (I focused on word usage and common images), how complex literary analysis is.   It is difficult to be able to analyze a piece from many different angles at one time.   That is what makes taking a course like and reading others essays so enriching.Thanks for sharing.;I only got Hawthorne essays as well.   It seems that The Birthmark struck a cord in many people and that is what they wanted to write about.;Some of the essays that I have read in this course appear to be summaries of journal articles or websites that are only tangentially related to the readings.   Several times the essays have had no references to the readings that were required at all.   This makes me wonder whether the author of those essays did the reading or not.;</string>

I&apos;m curious though what work that information was taken from.   Was it in &quot;The Portable Poe?&quot;   I read my stories out of &apos;The Complete...&quot; since that is what was in my library.   ;Thanks, Anon, for sharing.   I always find it interesting that we all focus on different images in the stories.   While I thought about the cat being a catalyst, I hadn&apos;t thought about the symbolism in as much depth as you were able to.;Efthymia, Thanks for sharing your essay.   I agree that Peer 3&apos;s statement about quotations is a little strong, but Peer 4 says the quotes were appropriate, and so I think you can allow those two comments to average out.   I particularly liked the statement that Aylmer considered Nature as a female character and to be controlled.   This is quite fitting with the Victorian sensibilities of the time and make it clear that his wife personifies Nature.;Amusing!   Very nice job with the rhyming - some small meter problems I think (without referring back to Poe).   I like the thesis with the reference to the Forbidden Fruit and the price to be paid for obtaining it - in Poe&apos;s case death to the object who inspired the quest for knowledge, Georgianna and the portrait painter&apos;s wife.Thanks for sharing.;Both Poe and Hawthorne write about psychological fixations, such as an irrational fixation on a birthmark, a black cat or a cloudy eye.   Writing in the 19th Century, neither would know of the term &quot;psychological fixation&quot; since the it was developed by Freud circa 1905 (Etymology).   These authors used the concept of fixation in ways that the world did not even have terminology for yet.As Dr. Rabkin presents etymology to deepen our understanding of the literature, I want to look at both the origins and subsequent uses of the term    fixation    as it relates to the literature of Poe and Hawthorne.   Appropriate to the mysticism of these authors    writing, the word comes from alchemy in the 14th Century (Etymology).   But more interesting are its subsequent uses in science after the authors&apos; deaths.Fixation in histology is a process by which biological tissues are prevented decay, therefore preventing putrefaction.   It terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions and may also increase the mechanical strength or stability of treated tissues (Wikipedia).   Thus, the mesmerism used on M. Valdemar that  prevented decay and stabilized his condition was a histological fixation.Carbon fixation, another biochemical process usually driven by photosynthesis, is a process whether carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds (Wikipedia).   We can imagine the mix of alchemy and photosynthesis at work in Rappiccini   s garden, and so that too is a type of fixation.In reading  we use visual fixation as we scan from word to word on the page.   In The Oval Portrait, the traveler has a visual fixation on the face of the woman that died and the words in the book that describes her marriage.  When I decided to look at fixation I thought I would have to struggle to make connections, but now it seems to be so central to the writing of Poe and Hawthorne, almost as if they invented the concept.   Thank you for fixating on my words for a short time.Thank you to the peer reviewers for your advice!Form:   3peer 1      This was a well-written essay, although I had a few little quibbles about the use of personal pronouns throughout it.peer 2      A very fixed spelling and grammar.peer 3      Well-written essay, with correct structure, grammar and spelling throughout.

That is a good insight, that all these stories are connected by the theme of fixation, it is not as obvious in some stories as in The Birthmark. Very clever conclusion,peer 5      Idea is well presented but I think it would benefit from some clarification and/ or simplification in order to fully understand writer&apos;s intent. While I see the use of fixation in Poe&apos;s and Hawthorne&apos;s work, I can&apos;t really say to see those &quot;central connections&quot; writer suggests are there.Other comments:peer 1      Well done and enjoy &apos;fixating&apos; on Wells.peer 3      My only extra comment is that I would be very, very cautious about breaking the Fourth Wall, as you did in the final sentence of your essay, as it pulled me right out of my immersion in the reading (which usually is the intent when a writer or actor breaks the Fourth Wall, but it felt out of place and invasive here). Otherwise well done!peer 4      Very good, well thought out.peer 5      Nice work, keep it up, but try to be more clear in presenting your idea.MEWaggoner&apos;s response:   First person singular:   I usually don&apos;t use first person in the essays but decided on that style this time.   It was a conscious choice specifically so I could break the Fourth Wall.Titles:   The majority of essays I have read did not have titles - I&apos;m assuming to stay within the word count - not sure what I think about that issue in general.Supporting evidence:   I could have included more examples from more stories from our reading list, I recall from previous posts in the forums that 2 examples were sufficient and I provided 6 if you count the three I list in the first sentence (The Birthmark, The Black Cat and The Tell-Tale Heart, 2 from Poe and 1 from Hawthorne.)Quotations from the text:   Are they required or is referring to the narrative indirectly sufficient?   In my own grading I have not required quotes.;Javier, It is exciting to meet a peer reviewer!   Don&apos;t worry about the brevity of your comments in the review.   Of five reviewers there seems to be plenty of feedback each time.I was focusing on the use of the term rather than the concept, but I might not have made that clear (it was what I hoped I was saying when I referred to etymology and the previous and subsequent uses of the term fixation in relation to the time of Poe and Hawthorne).   According to the Online Etymology Dictionary:fixation (n.)  late 14c.,  fixacion, an alchemical word, from Medieval Latin  fixationem  (nominative  fixatio), noun of action from past participle stem of Latin  fixare, frequentative of  figere  &quot;to fix&quot; (see  fix  (v.)). Used in the Freudian sense since 1910.fixate (v.)  1885, &quot;to fix, make stable,&quot; from  fix  (v.) +  -ate. Meaning &quot;to gaze upon&quot; is from 1889. Psychological sense is from 1926, originally in Freudian theory, in this case perhaps a back-formation from  fixation. Related:  Fixated;  fixating.So even though Freud might have used the term more specifically as in anal or oral fixations, the use as a psychological term, rather than an alchemical term, was not in use until after Freud began using it (actually in 1905 according to another source I read.)   According to the second entry, the meaning of fixate as &quot;to gaze upon&quot; was not in use until 1889, also after Poe and Hawthorne.   Yes, the idea of fixating on an object (either visual or  psychological)   existed before Poe and Hawthorne, but the word fixate or fixation was not in use in that way until after both of these authors&apos; deaths.   I would have liked to have included this level of detail in the essay, but have been striving to stay within the 320 word limit.Thanks for your expanded feedback.;Sean, Thanks for your feedback.Since the origins of the word fixation are from the Latin fixar = to fix, and that predated Poe and Hawthorne in that usage.   And so it would have been possible for either to use the word in that way.   I counted 13 uses of &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;fixedly&quot; in  Old Manse and 12 uses in  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, volumes 1 and 2, but neither author used fixation in those books.   I didn&apos;t refer to a book on scientific etymology, but suspect that histological fixation was termed later even though the concept fits Poe&apos;s mesmerism experiment.Alas, I didn&apos;t have time to finish &quot;Artist of the Beautiful&quot; and so missed that reference.   I&apos;ll have to finish it now.;Again, focusing on the word origins and not the concepts themselves, from the Online Etymology Dictionary:histology (n.)  &quot;study of organic tissues,&quot; 1847, from  histo-  +  -ology.;Florencia, thank you for your encouraging words.   Best wishes.;Thanks for introducing me to &quot;Women in Refrigerators.&quot;   I might have to write sometime about the relationship between it and &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic.&quot;   Having just &quot;discovered&quot; and started reading graphic novels, I will have to check out the website you cited.   Very nicely done.;Wide Sargasso Sea is on my reading list! - but alas, is a little far down in the queue.   First there is the reading for two MOOCs, then two books written by friends that need reviews done, then reading for course prep for fall, ...   Thanks for the recommendation.;Given that our &quot;grade&quot; is best on the 7 best grades out of 10, I am happy to see some creative efforts, especially when they might be graded lower by peer reviewers expecting the traditional essay.I was wondering in &quot;The Black Cat&quot; and &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; if the perpetrator of the crimes were required, by social conventions of the time - much like our movie codes of the past century, to be caught.   Did Poe every write about a killer that got away?Thanks for sharing.   I enjoyed it.;Thanks for sharing.   You asked about grammar errors.   Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve got.Maybe the peer reviewer doesn&apos;t not understand the use of &quot;suspect&quot; as an adjective.    You have used it correctly in the first sentence, but it is an uncommon use that some might have be familiar with.Some people might consider the appositive     The Artist of the Beautiful    in the third paragraph nonessential and, thus, should be offset with commas.   However, it is essential to describe which story you are referring to and having no commas is appropriate.In the last paragraph, the phrase following the semicolon is not a complete sentence, and so a comma would have been appropriate.   But, frankly, I had to really dig for the third point.   On my first reading I didn&apos;t notice anything amiss and actually quite enjoyed the essay.;I chose Wikipedia instead of the scientific texts in my roommate&apos;s office, which I also consulted, because it was easy reference for a general audience, such as our peer reviewers in this course.   There is some historical taboo about using Wikipedia that I don&apos;t understand.   It is a good source of references to scientific and other resources and is fine for a starting place for research.   If information is substantiated in other sources, any source it comes from is legitimate, regardless of the perceived authority of the source.These facts, which were not random in the scientific sense at all and if you are studying science I am surprised you used the term incorrectly, but were related by a common etymology, precisely the subject that Dr. Rabkin is teaching us to appreciate.What novels are you referring to?   ;I see.   In this unit we read short stories instead of novels - that was my confusion.   Also, random is a scientific term that means there is no pattern and no connection.   It is often used colloquially as a replacement for the term non sequitur, i.e., to mean something unrelated to the current topic of conversation.   As a scientist myself, I prefer to avoid the colloquial use.I wonder also if the fact that English is not your first language, Anon, makes the difference in the use of the scientific term &quot;fixation&quot;.   Maybe in the translation (or back translation if the term originated in another language other than English) the scientific term fixation is not the same in each separate discipline, which could explain why you think it is not used much in science.    I just did a brief quiz of my scientifically minded friends on Facebook, and so far they have replied that they frequently use the term fixation in psychology and the medical field.   In the latter, there is a &quot;fixation of the bowel&quot;.   I didn&apos;t know about that term at the time I wrote the essay and wish I had to try to fit it in somewhere.Thanks for clarifying some confusing points I had with your comment.   While I disagree with you that I over-stretched the idea to fit the novels, I appreciate that you took the time to comment.;Sean, thanks for sharing.   Despite what the reviewers said, I learned something from your essay because I hadn&apos;t read Poe&apos;s biography.   I like that you pointed out the uses of phrases like &quot;once upon a time&quot; and &quot;a kingdom by the see&quot; and how they set the tone of the writing.   I am not yet to the point where I pick up on these cues readily, and it was valuable for those to be reiterated for me.;</string>
            <string>Fiction, as a genre in literature, encompasses a large number of sub-genres, fantasy being one of those.  Fantasy:   &quot;is the forming of mental images with strange or other worldly settings or characters; fiction which invites suspension of reality.&quot;Fiction: &quot;can be defined as narrative literary works whose content is produced by the imagination and is not necessarily based on fact. In fiction something is feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story.&quot;Source (with other definitions of genres):  http://genresofliterature.com/;Many good answers here.It&apos;s useful to conceive of any genre simply as a set of expectations. Broadly, all fiction involves fantasy in the sense of imagining what a character might say in some situation, or conceiving of what another character might do in some given context. But that conception of fantasy has more to do with reader reception, or perhaps, too, with authorial concerns, rather than specific kinds of subject matter.But when a friend says to you, &quot;Hey, let&apos;s go see a horror movie,&quot; your reaction will be informed by the set of expectations that come to mind. And these expectations are rather finely calibrated. Most people will fairly instantly understand the differences in their own expectations between a &quot;teen-horror flick&quot; -- transgressive sex, incidental cruelty, a cabin in the woods, punishment of both of these things by an indestructible monster with a horrible past and terrible disfigurement -- and, say, a &quot;psychological horror film&quot; -- a vulnerable protag with reason to doubt his own perceptions, a loving partner who only wants to help, a series of dark twists and shocking losses that drive toward the revelation that, oops, the loving partner&apos;s not so loving after all. There are many variations on the theme, sure, but only a few key categorical identifiers will signal lists of expected characters and plot points, along with a number of notable titles to be called into comparison.You&apos;ll know what to expect from a western, or a romance, or a family drama, and those expectations might extend beyond plot and character to tone, style, and even, sometimes, running time. When I think of fantasy, I&apos;ll probably immediately call Tolkien to mind, though others will think of George R. R. Martin. These authors both might have had different ideas about how fantasy can and should go -- there&apos;s wiggle room -- but the ways in which those authors&apos; stories are similar probably do more to gauge audience expectations than the places in which they&apos;re different. We know, too, what we&apos;re getting into with sci-fi, for the most part, and sub-genres abound.For me, though, genre can be tricky, because it is a set of expectations based on easily identifiable signifiers. Genre can be so knee-jerk, in fact, that it can be entirely misleading, and so it&apos;s useful to keep historical and cultural context in mind. Some might think of  Twilight, for example, as a class of horror fiction, because of its engagement with vampire tropes, but for me it&apos;s a fantasy story that has far more to do with elves than vampires. That assertion might seem odd at first, but No  l Carroll, who writes about the horror genre, says in his essay, &quot;The Nature of Horror,&quot; that in order for a monster to be classified as belonging to the art-horror genre, it must be both threatening and impure. Carroll identifies impurity, if I remember correctly, as engendering in the positive protagonist a fundamental response of revulsion -- a desire not to be touched by the monster. The vampires in  Twilight can be suitably threatening (given the target audience), but they&apos;re seldom impure. Most of them are actually pretty cool, if not actually sexy, and given that significant portions of the story are set in the woods, where creatures who glow indulge their otherworldly powers, it becomes almost difficult not to expect Legolas to show up, bow in hand.Anyway, I hope that makes some sense. All the best.;There&apos;s another interesting aspect to Twilight that many people don&apos;t realize - Fifty Shades of Grey, published as a novel in its own right, began life as a Twilight fanfiction. There are some moral/ethical issues there, if not copyright ones, but it&apos;s a compelling discussion to delve into for anyone who is so inclined; we are, of course, all entitled to &quot;play&quot; in other authors&apos; worlds (fanfiction has existed in one form or another as long as fiction itself has), but at what point does that play encroach on the original author&apos;s space? If Twilight is fantasy and Fifty Shades of Grey is romance, and Fifty Shades of Grey is a dressed up Twilight fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off, then does that make *Twilight* more romance than fantasy? The whole controversy demonstrates how malleable and arbitrary such labels can be.... yet no author can be published without knowing what labels fit their work (and which labels will work to sell books).That leads to a final interesting question - if genre labels are more of a simple selling tool than an accurate way to categorize books, then should we, as readers, pay attention to them at all?These questions are all debatable, by the way. I&apos;d be happy to see discussion from anyone who doesn&apos;t think Twilight is fantasy, thinks that Fifty Shades of Grey is not at all overstepping authorial bounds, thinks genre labels are a distinct and vital tool, etc.;This was a discussion that a few friends of mine had.   Here&apos;s some responses ...I know, and the Science Fantasy category doesn&apos;t even include Star Wars, arguably the most well-known science fantasy of them all. In truth, you could argue that most science fiction is in fact science fantasy, and many bookstores include science fiction in the fantasy section. But in defense of Jane, she did specify books, not movies.Also, many of these categories bleed into each other. Harry Potter, for instance, is both Contemporary Fantasy and High Fantasy.Other examples of science fantasy:the John Carter seriesTerry Brooks&apos; ShannaraDragon Ball ZMore Low Fantasy:Conan  The Green MilePreacher (wow, a map based on Preacher? Sign me up!)A Song of Fire and Ice is actually High Fantasy, not Low Fantasy. It has dragons and supernatural entities, for one thing. Low fantasy is primarily set in the &quot;real world,&quot; whatever that entails, while high fantasy takes place in a completely fictional world with its own laws of physics.Other high fantasy works:The Northern LightsThe Chronicles of NarniaDungeons and DragonsWheel of TimeDiscworldThe Dark Tower (elements of the supernatural, magic)Harry Potter (yes, it takes place in the contemporary world, but most of the action takes place in the wizarding world, which is definitely High Fantasy - wizards, dragons, mythological beasts, etc.)Alice in WonderlandMalazanThe Black Company (yes, it&apos;s dark, but it&apos;s in a different world with its own rules)For Contemporary Fantasy, you could have things likeThe Dresden FilesFablesThor (high fantasy as well)Hellboy (as Lovecraftian as comics get, so dark fantasy, too)Preacher (again!)Harry Potter (fits here, too)Lewis&apos; That Hideous StrengthMary Poppins (hah!)His Dark Materials (again)more Dark Fantasy:The Dark Towerthe Elric booksThe Black CompanySo don&apos;t despair! High Fantasy is a broad enough category to contain many different types of maps....historical fantasy is my choice! whether in the realms of king arthur, norse gods, the pharaohs or something completely different, there is plenty of fertile ground for the imagination to bring forth a truly original work....Funny how different people use the same terms different ways. I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek, but I would call it &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi. Star Wars, with its mystical &quot;Force&quot; seems a little softer, leaning to science fantasy. (The Force was mystical to me in the original trilogy. I have heard indirectly that other stories have tried to give it more of a scientific basis, but I don&apos;t have anything first-hand on that.)...Science fiction is fantasy. We cannot travel at warp speed to distant planets. No one can carry around a light sword, who would not like a robot to do the house hold chores or to play with the kids. These three are science fiction, but also fantasy when played in the imagination of a 10 year old. Whilst science fiction and fantasy can be classed as two different things (sci-fi based on the plausable) you have a genre of fantasy call science fantasy. Stories that contain a mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. Trek and Wars belong in this category. Where does Avatar fit into the definition? Science fiction elements include the futuristic part, giant machines, space travel and Aliens. The fantasy part comes from the aliens though. They have no science. At the end of the film one character transforms from human to Na   vi, moves from the world of science fiction to that of fantasy.    Popular sicence fantasy include:Star Wars, Dune, The Golden Compass, The Gods of Mars, The Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy....I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek[Answered by]Hypospray - Injectors like this have been in use for many years.Personal communicators - who does not have a mobile telephone today?Phasers - wicked lasers spider 3 is the closest today    Universal Translator - these are now around. Iphone have it I think.Medical tricorders - A competition was won by a couple of students to build one of these for real. It had to diagnose 10 different things.[[Answered by]Ah, but none of these things existed when Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry in the mid 1960&apos;s. In my mind, it is science fiction if plausible technological advancements could bring about the essential elements of the story, so clearly Star Trek falls into that category. You are almost making my point for me. But the human brain will never be a source of telekinetic power, so the Force remains fantasy. (Inb4 someone says Star Wars does not portray humans, but humanoids who lived &quot;long ago in a galaxy far far away&quot;.)In my mind, science fiction is not fantasy. If it is supernatural, it is fantasy. If it might be natural, but we don&apos;t yet have the skills or evidence, then it can be science fiction. There is perhaps a spectrum between these two concepts: after all, Clarke&apos;s Third Law of Prediction is &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot;Now you have me thinking about what distinguishes science fiction from &quot;mainstream&quot; fiction. In some ways, the &quot;CSI&quot; TV series are just barely science fiction in my mind, because what they do could be possible, but in reality, you do not get DNA results overnight. (But someday, perhaps we will.) And what about a novel like Harry Turtledove&apos;s &quot;Supervolcano: Eruption&quot;? It describes an eruption in Yellowstone Park, the likes of which has not been seen in over 600,000 years, but which geologists recognize as a real possibility. But we don&apos;t know precisely what the effects would be, so it is speculative fiction (another term occasionally used instead of science fiction)....Science fiction is like pornography. You may not be able to describe it, but you know it when you see it.    This is the problem with polls that I think we can all agree on, no matter how it it worded or how many different subjects we place on them, people around the world will always have different definitions for them. When we start to draw this, a lot of leeway can be given to the artist to come up with something new....I chose contemporary fantasy ... partly because no-one else seems to be talking about it, partly because I had to look it up to properly understand it, partly because Artemis Fowl is one of my all time favourite stories, partly because of the cross-overs with other things (like 666 Park Ave, Under the Mountain, Lovecraft, The Man in Yellow and a  gazillion  other things) and partly because I like forging new roads rather than arguing old stuff!...Science fantasy was a toss up between A wrinkle in the skin and Starship Troopers. Both are fantastic books and probably rank in my best books of all time list.[John Christopher: A wrinkle in the Skin, Robert Heinlein: Starship Troopers]...Historical Fantasy.I suppose it&apos;s premature to speak of specific concepts, but I&apos;m having an idea. I&apos;ve always loved the &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; series of novels, in which historical figures like Sargon the Great, Julius Ceasar, Ernest Hemingway, Confucius, and Napoleon come to be recombined in new and entertaining ways....High Fantasy / Epic Fantasy                                   Low Fantasy                 Historical Fantasy                 Dark Fantasy                Contemporary Fantasy                   Science Fantasy                ...And a bag of chocolate fish to anyone who can say where I got these quotes from ...  ;And we have a winner ;);Is science fiction a kind of cristal ball giving us sparks from the future or it is memories from the unkown future, a kind of colective memory (Jung) that is returning from this far space and time?;</string>
            <string>Although there was no evidence of him doing anything wrong there was a lot of speculation. The   epigraph to  Through the Looking-Glass  laments the real Alice&apos;s growing up. He regretted the move from little girl to adult. Here is one stanza.  Come, hearken then, ere voice of dread,With bitter tidings laden,Shall summon to unwelcome bedA melancholy maiden!We are but older children, dear,Who fret to find our bedtime near.;I have been trying to find a new angle for an essay on Alice. There has been so much written already that it might be impossible.I love the play with words in Through the Looking Glass from Jabberwokky to the Gnat to Humpty Dumpty.  I can&apos;t find to much on the internet about the symbolism of names apart from how they relate to identity. If anyone know more then please let me know.  ;Thank you Stephanie. Not so much the roots of the words as what it means. For example in the wood she forgets her name and the faun forgets what he is - they lose their identity. There may be more to it but I am not certain.Greg thanks for the tip about the Annotated Alice in Wonderland. I have found it on Amazon but fear it will not be with me in time for an essay. Might be fun to read anyway.   ;</string>
            <string>I just finished A Princess of Mars and the character of the princess didn&apos;t annoy me so much as the two women in Dracula.   I kept having to remember that they were characters in Victorian England and that, for then, these were pretty strong female characters.  I think A Princes of Mars is worth reading for other reasons. You can certainly see traces of more modern science fiction within it. I was constantly reminded of Star Wars throughout.  ;I found the word limit very challenging. I take the five paragraph approach to essay writing, introduction (including premise) 3 arguments and then conclusion. I wrote them all out and then whittled away at them until I was within the limit. I took out all the adjectives and adverbs, changed sentences from passive to active and made sentences short and to the point. I found that by the end I had an essay within the limits. Oh I also took out any references to me - I think, in my opinion etc - this should be obvious as I am writing it so it will not be anyone else&apos;s opinion.I hope this helps.;Thank you Marie - I will look for that one too.;Annemarie you are a wonder. Thank you so much. Now I won&apos;t have to Bordeaux on a Saturday.  ;Hello EmmaThe theme of identity is a strong one and I that might be all there is to it. When I looked into he symbolism for shoes for my Grimm tale I found different culture dependent symbolism. Western culture saw sexual significance of a foot going into a shoe, Arabians see feet and shoes as a sign of insult, Oriental of wealth and beauty. So although I can see a link with identity I wanted to explore other views. There may be nothing more to it, Certainly as this book was written by someone from western culture, identity is a clear   symbol. As the words name and noun are the same word in some languages there may be something different in that. Certainly in oriental cultures your name would have a meaning.You are not off target at all - I probably am. I may be looking for things that are either not there or not at all relevant.  ;Thank you Daniel.Yes I have considered a trip to the library. I need to go into town on Saturday and so I will see if I can get to the library. I prefer to wait for the library bus to come to my village but it is not due for a while, nor does it have a very wide selection. I avoid crowded places if I can as they make me ill so I will have to see what Bordeaux is like on Saturday.;Hello again.Yes it is lovely but as I avoid crowds Saturday is not my favorite day to go. I am very lucky to live close to this beautiful place. I am hoping my daughter will go to University there when she has finished at Lycee - a couple of years yet.   ;Excellent essay and certainly meets the criteria of improving a reader&apos;s knowledge of the subject. You have evidently researched your subject well and it was beautifully written. Vouch is the right word - I am certain of it.  ;I received a satisfactory 4 for my essay. I think the comments were fair - ish. If I have learned anything from this first essay it is that you can&apos;t please everyone.My essay is [  here  ]  if you wish to see it.  ;Poulomi  - thank you for your comment - nice to meet you here and I am sure I will see you in Greek and Roman Mythology soon.Florencia  - yes- re reading that sentence it does need tightening and I will try to do better. That it what I am here for. I liked peer 3&apos;s notes apart from the note that I had no reference for something that was indeed referenced.  Danielle  - It is amazing isn&apos;t it how often you notice once someone points it out. I found out quite by accident when making notes of all the references for my essay. The note was sheer laziness on my part. I came across the dictionary of symbolism at about the sixth draft of this essay and included a mention in the first paragraph. I should have re numbered all my citations.  ;</string>

            <string>I think this is a good essay. It is clear and argues well. The sentences are a little long in places. I think the second paragraph needs some work.;It is not good for a peer to decide they learned nothing merely because it was the same subject as their own. Laurie has done a good job in reviewing and in fact some good tips that I will take on board for my essays.  ;I think this is a difficult on Florencia. I wonder if the guidelines should make this clearer. If in one case we are marked down for not stating the premise and another time for stating it then something is wrong.   I agree with the comment for this essay that the premise or thesis is not clearly stated. But when you read the essay what you are saying makes it clear.  ;Florencia seems to have said all that needed to be said. I just wanted to chip in to say that I enjoyed reading it.  ;It&apos;s a good well written essay Theo. The form is good and your arguments well illustrated and logical.BUT there are several times when the women were definitely not stereotypical. Lucy wrote to Mina that she would like to marry all three of her suitors. Mina has the strength to resist the Count. The three women in the castle feminize Harker by having him recumbent. They are sexual predators. You need to consider also the time this book was written. Would they have been stereotypes of the day. Mina at one point describes herself as Lucy as new women.  Saying that I would not mark you down on this essay merely because I challenge your view point. These are points to consider.  ;No, your essay is not as bad as peer 1 states. The meaning is clear apart from the superfluous &apos;not&apos; in the sentence that Florencia has already pointed out. I agree with the others, peer one is very rude.  For the future I would not recommend using Google translate as it is a very poor translation program, Reverso is only slightly better. You might consider using &apos;Grammarly&apos; although you have to pay after the trial. Typing into &apos;word&apos; or an email program will check spelling and some grammar errors.If you are talking about the writer it is fine to just use their family name but not their first name. I don&apos;t know which culture you come from but for speakers of English the second name is conventionally the family name. I guess from your name that you are from Oriental Asia where this convention is reversed.  ;It is interesting to see from the above how some peers write very little and some write detailed valuable comments. Mine is posted here  along with the comments.  ;Thank you Florence. The main essay focused on that one part of the book but I thought I had taken the theme as a whole. I am glad you agree. All my essays so far divert a little. I think that is because I am Greek and Roman Mythology at the same time.   I will try to focus.  ;</string>
            <string>Thank goodness for that. I was wondering how to write about all of these stories. As he says there is enough for a whole essay in each story.  ;Hi Olivier. I downloaded the free version linked from the course syllabus.

If you wish to see my essay it is here  http://louisecharente.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/frankenstein/   I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have time to read any others as I want to finish and submit  my Poe/Hawthorne   essay before I go.;Hello first anonymous.  I had a problem in the beginning with being marked down for my British English too. In the &apos;works cited&apos; part I now put &quot;This essay is written in British English&quot; including the link. This has resolved the issue for me in a very simple way. Coursera is an American organisation so I would expect more Americans than any other nationality. I am not very surprised that they would consider these to be errors. After all in the UK we aren&apos;t taught American English so I don&apos;t suppose that Americans are taught British English.  I don&apos;t think we should consider one English as being any more &apos;real&apos; than another. After all Americans use much older English words than the British, words that they took with them from England that have now changed in British English.  On a worldwide basis we have to accept that American English has become much more prevalent. The film industry and the growth of the internet has spread American English far more widely than British English. I teach English to business men and women world wide. If there is an American equivalent of a British word I teach both. People who work internationally are more likely to encounter American than British English particularity if working with oriental Asia, a high growth area.The English language, wherever it is spoken, changes frequently. New words are added and words change meaning. We no longer speak the same language as Shakespeare. Some grammar rules have changed as you can see in reading these Victorian novels.Anyway, I am rambling on. I hope that the tip of marking your essay as written in British English works for you.;Oh yes - I agree, I think that they should know and not mark you down. What I was saying was that I am not surprised by it and nor do I think that BrE is any more &apos;real&apos; than AmE. When we read an American author I will certainly not attempt to write my essay in anything other than the English I know.  Good luck with the rest of the course.  ;</string>

            <string>Samuel, I&apos;m not surprised; writers can be prickly about how their own work is categorized! That&apos;s not limited to writers of the written word, either... U2 made a famous (and unrepeatable-in-polite-company) comment regarding how they felt about being classified as &quot;alternative rock.&quot;I&apos;ve been working on my current magnum opus for about 13 years now, over many many drafts, and I still don&apos;t know what it would be officially categorized as. Difficulty in categorizing it is part of the reason I haven&apos;t got it into print yet... I&apos;ve had publishers call it &quot;general fiction,&quot; &quot;slice of life,&quot; and &quot;disability fiction.&quot; All are applicable, but the first two are too broad to be considered &quot;marketable&quot; (you need a more specific target genre), and the third.... well, as proud as I am of being a writer with a disability who incorporates disability issues into my work, I&apos;m slightly uncomfortable with the pigeonholing that &quot;disability fiction&quot; implies. None of my work has ever been *about* disability - if I&apos;ve done my job well, it&apos;s good fiction that incorporates characters who happen to be disabled as regular people. And the term &quot;disability fiction,&quot; or &quot;crip lit,&quot; as disabled writers irreverently call it, hasn&apos;t been around long enough for the average reader to grab hold of that idea... ablebodied people see the label &quot;disability fiction&quot; and think it&apos;s going to be a work *about* disability, instead of a work where disabled characters go about their daily lives (or solve mysteries, or fight aliens, or whatever... but at least in those cases, the writer has the option of the &apos;mystery&apos; or &apos;sci fi&apos; tag).Put another way, I don&apos;t take issue with the *term* &quot;disability fiction&quot; but I do take issue with the &quot;a very special episode!&quot;, after school special, The More You Know connotations it realistically has for anyone not disabled. Anyone expecting trite platitudes or life lessons from my work would be shocked out of their shoes when they cracked it open to find a Dubliner with a penchant for using the F-word in as many creative ways as possible and her Brooklynite husband whose language is only a little more clean!I suspect your friend probably took issue with the fantasy label vis-a-vis his work because writing historical fiction involves *mountains* of research about the real history involved, and &quot;fantasy&quot; as a genre has a reputation for being something you can make up out of whole cloth. That&apos;s not true of course - the worldbuilding involved in creating a solid fantasy world is just as intense, even if you&apos;re researching as a starting point and going from there. But it&apos;s the same general problem in terms of the *perception* of the label by the general public vs. how difficult it actually is to write. &quot;Modern historical novel&quot; has a gravitas in the eyes of the reading public that &quot;fantasy&quot; doesn&apos;t.;</string>
            <string>While I&apos;m enjoying the efforts to calculate the actual value of the gold--soon we&apos;ll have graphs of price-per-pound of various cuts of meat in this thread--but the symbolism of gold in these stories seems clear as a reward of the highest value. I&apos;d have to disagree with Greg and agree with Florencia--this is a story (one of many) about a foolish person who in every instance makes a bad trade.

            <string>Thank you all for such interesting and lively discussion.Twilight is an interesting thing to discuss. I have never thought of it as horror because it doesn&apos;t make me feel the way I think horror should. And yet maybe it does for some people. I very much like the idea of genres leading to expectations. I know some writers who go to great pains to pigeon hole their book into one genre or another so that their audience will find it and then it will meet those expectations.  ;</string>
            <string>I suppose a crystal ball theory would be accurate since psychics tend to be inaccurate!Whilst I agree with the statements that ave been supposed by the course leader, to say science fiction directly influences and moulds our actual future is...not especially accurate. Take any image of the future and it says more about that time period than any image of the future! Some aspects are kept, some are discarded as they are no longer fashionable or technologically applicable.  For example, one of the &quot;future&quot; inventions of the past was a machine that printed out a fresh newspaper for you at the breakfast table. I can&apos;t quite recall if this was thought up in the Fifties or early Sixties but don&apos;t you think that there is quite a lot of that time period at work? There&apos;s implicit roles set out - that most people would all still gather around a breakfast table before heading off to work or school, that people had time in the morning to read a newspaper. Even the concept of the newspaper itself is somewhat outdated since far more up-to-date news can be found through the Internet as and when it happens (which is why newspapers are going down the toilet and thus relying more heavily on opinion over...uh...news.).  The future of the past is just a projection of the past with shiny things and robot slaves.  I&apos;m leaving a really nice link to a program called How TV Ruined Your Life. It&apos;s really funny (can be crude and the like) but it illustrates a rather good point...at least I think!http://youtu.be/lfk_HQCiZ2E ;</string>
            <string>I remember a cartoon in the 80&apos;s which had audio and video cassettes as a means to store data, and computers like Sinclair Spectrums used cassettes to record and store games, etc. I doubt that they would have thought that there would be better means to store data such as memory sticks, CD-rs in the future, and watching the cartoon now shows how dated it is, but on the other hand, somethings have proven to be true, or as near as you can get it - the communicators in Star Trek and comlinks in Star Wars being an equivalent of mobile phones, data pads being e-readers, etc. And if you think about it, the printer in your example has come true to some extent, because you have printers for computers.;</string>

            <string>Megan, it&apos;s actually a myth that Dickens was paid by the word. Victorian writers often wrote in (and were paid by) installments for the serials they wrote (see http://dickens.ucsc.edu/resources/faq/by-the-word.html). So while it may appear that they&apos;re paid &quot;by the word&quot; it&apos;s more that they&apos;re paid to draw out their stories into longer and more complicated plots - though some chose to use verbosity instead. Also, Paul Fussell&apos;s The Great War and Modern Memory argues that it&apos;s not just sophistication at stake, but the importance of the medium and the message. Think of Hemmingway&apos;s short choppy sentences and the effect that has on the reader&apos;s understanding of the plot and tone. ;</string>
            <string>Marie: I also love Into the Woods! Fabulous blog entry, by the way.Cyndi:   I do not think you&apos;ll regret reading this series! Have fun with it!fiellixiang: I, too, love the universe and the characters. I also love searching the artwork for subtle little things (like the names of shops, brands on clothes, or fairy tale characters that the artist put in).  ;</string>
            <string>Yes, Geralyn, the portrayal of women is so refreshing (especially in a comic book format) in Fables. I, too, love Cinderella!  ;</string>
            <string>Using additional technology for a study group found outside of the forum is a great idea! I mean, it unfortunately limits the amount of exposure some of your ideas get to the student body at large, but I think that&apos;s kind of what a &quot;study group&quot; is for -- an intimate exchange of thoughts between a more defined subset of individuals rather than the overarching entirety.  I&apos;m not familiar with google hangout; please, tell me more :) One program I am familiar with is Trello, a project management site where you separate discussions into lists and cards that can be separately responded to and a maneuvered around an organizational board. Trello is visually very appealing if you use images on the cards and its workings are pretty intuitive.  Btw, would either of you, Juan and Geralyn, be interested in forming a study group together?;In another course some of the students formed a study group on Google Community (on G+). It is a decent platform for this type of thing. On G+ you can use Hangout (as Geralyn mentions above), you can also set up important dates (along with reminders) on Google Calendar (which can send you an email or text message, etc), create events, share photos, have online discussions, etc. My experience with a G+ Community as a study group for the other course was that it was an excellent additional support for the class. I would be interested in participating in one here for this course as well.  My G+ profile is here. If someone sets up a G+ Community for this course, please send me an invite. Also, if you just want to connect with me there so we can stay in touch beyond this class, feel free to send a friend request, I&apos;ll add you back.  ;I absolutely adored Angel&apos;s Game by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.

            <string>I do agree that most of the texts seem very, very old. Some, such as Dracula, might seem better for a class on horror. However, Katrina has a good point about how much impact the texts have currently.  I feel as if the fairy tales especially are important, since we see those stories being retold over and over in books that have been written for even students who are under six;);</string>
            <string>Unwritten is a very good one, as well. I need to re-read those. About the sheer force of belief, most of the tales have folk magic in some form or another or there are symbols for it throughout. And that was maintained by a sheer force of belief. I think that is really cool about folk tales. How you can see the peoples lives mirrored in the stories. Their beliefs and fears.  ;@Katrina Anyway you have a link so we could read them? If you don&apos;t mind that is.  One of my favorite graphic novels is Three Shadows. It&apos;s not literary based but it is a bit fairy tale like. Regardless, it&apos;s a beautiful, moving piece. I think there is a ;</string>
            <string>Yes, women play the part of the villian in a lot of stories. But they also play the part of the helper; fairies and such...I think the difference is that when the woman is bad she belongs to a certain category (witch, enchantress, step-mother...) while the bad men are usually kings and older brothers, people who are used in other stories as do-gooders.;</string>
            <string>Hi guys!As I am not familiar with the word counting technique (in Poland we don&apos;t set the word limit papers, the teacher decides whether we put everything we could in our work) and only counted the words on my english classes and CAE exam course, I just wonder what is counted for a word.  I mean if e.g. &quot;isn&apos;t&quot; is two words or one word and if the Thesis on the top of the work is also counted to the word limit?;I am aware of word processors word counting features :)I was just wondering if the courses has it&apos;s own limits or rules. But If the assignment page counts the words too, I don&apos;t have anything to worry about.;I think they are not allowed, although this is a writing which audience are our fellow students so I am not sure about that.;So I don&apos;t have to put the &quot;THESIS: TEXT&quot; on top of the work, I just have to write it down in the first paragraph as part of the introduction?And refraining from counting citations is the new thing for me. Thank you for your response :);I have already pasted and saved mine as a draft.It counts &quot;Dracula&apos;s&quot; as two words, but working on my paper starting from 380 words I have managed to get down to 316 with all &apos; &apos;s&apos;.;While reading the story of rabbit and the maiden I did not think of &quot;sitting on the tail&quot; as sex but as a warning: &quot;don&apos;t go with strangers&quot; or don&apos;t talk to them as in &quot;Little Red Cap&quot; or let them into the house like in &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Kids&quot;.Propably these stories are to prevent the children from getting in contact with people they don&apos;t know and show them what are the consequences of talking and going away with them.Maybe the Rabbit would &quot;hurt&quot; the Maiden and took away her virginity (if she was a virgin) after the wedding, but Grimm usually wrote about killing with axes, chopping the bodies and so on. I did not encounter any story focusing on sex.Although you may be right because after reading the &quot;The Rabbit&apos;s Bride&quot;  I was thinking about more of pedophiles or people who abduct women for their own pleasure. I did not get simillar thought with other stories.For the fox meaning I found only this for now:&quot;In pre-Christian Times the fox was seen as a symbol of gods, like for example, as a symbol of the god of vegetation or as a symbol of forest- and mountain-spirits. This changed in Christian Times, from where on the fox was seen as a demonic creature. The fox is a very famous figure in fables and usually is described as greedy, dishonest and tricky. At the same time of all the helpful animals in fairy tales the fox is said to be the most helpful one. Most fables tell about how the fox tricks other animals to get food, but no legends or fairy tales have been found telling about the fox attacking humans.&quot;http://www.wsl.ch/land/products/predator/paper2.htm;I think that we should find something that we perceive as important in the stories. Not one story in particular.I myself chose a few that matched my thesis.Although I read all of them.;</string>
            <string>I think you have a great idea and a good working thesis, but I&apos;d  encourage you to combine your ideas about social status into ONE strong  sentence that starts your essay. (see http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/) Right  now, your &quot;essay&quot; has what could make up the meat of your polished  essay, but it needs a strong guiding sentence that explicitly states  your analysis of the role of social status in the stories (and what  might be the importance of such ideas in the tales). Consider what does  having luck compared to virtues signify? Also, I&apos;m not sure if  this is the essay you plan to submit, so please ignore this final  thought if it&apos;s useless, but the phrase &quot;while I was reading I noticed&quot;  is extraneous wording, much like Prof. Rabkin&apos;s example of &quot;In this  essay I will discuss.&quot; It&apos;s incredibly useful in early drafts to get you  started writing, but use your word count to go deeper into your ideas.  Make every word earn its place. ;</string>
            <string>Thank you so very much. I think the distinction between luck and fortune was the piece i was actually missing. Thank you.;</string>
            <string>First of all, I just want to thank everyone for their input.I would just like to make a small distinction about something I feel people are misinterpreting in my point of view.i only aim to analyse the male characters. Although I really appreciate what some of you said about female characters, I do think gender is a game changer when it comes to these stories. There might me some things in common between male and female heroes, some aspects, like beauty and submission , play different and important parts in the characters &quot;story&quot; depending on their gender. As I know most people are usually interested in the female lead, I thought the male lead would be a source of new and refreshing material to understand.But feel free to tell me if I&apos;m wrong in thinking so. Maybe gender isn&apos;t as important as I thought and that might give me some new perspective.;Does anyone know if we can or should share our essay here? I finished my draft, it&apos;s still over the word limit, but maybe you guys can help. Specially since English is not my native language. I&apos;m always afraid I&apos;m using the wrong terms or a false friend or something.;I would add Hansel and Grethel, as it is the father who first suggests getting rid of the children. I&apos;ve noticed a general trend of male characters staying in the shadow and either doing nothing or obeying their wives (e.g. The Fisherman and His Wife). I&apos;m sure there is a message in it. Does it reflect matriarchy or does it solve the problem of patriarchy in real life, making women stronger in fairy tales?;This has got to be the most entertaining discussion I&apos;ve seen all week.;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>I hope you will end up agreeing with it too. What do you mean by cross-cultural differences?;</string>
            <string>I absolutely agree with the point of discussion, but in some tales the kings or the princes falls in love with the women at the very first glance. They never thought why is this woman in the woods all alone or why were they warned about the woman. They, blindly carried away by the beauty of the woman never ask them any question and more over grant them wishes. This quality of them lead to problems , that could be for good or bad. But their attitude of instantly reacting and getting into trouble is talked about in some tales. So, I think it was both good and bad. It was my understanding. Please share your thoughts. Thanks in advance.;Well, when I read The Death of the Hen, all I could think about was As I Lay Dying that I was forced to read in high school....;I was going to go with Abraham and Isaac for Faithful John, too... there is a medieval Spanish book about a servant and his master, the servant is told to be prudent and wise. In one of the stories there is a fowl served at the dinner table and one leg is missing. The servant tells the master this bird has only one leg. Then they go riding and they see some birds drinking in a pond, and one of their legs is up. These are the same birds, says the servant, see? But when the master yells down comes the second leg to fly away. The master then confronts the servant and the servant answers, but my lord, you did not yell at the bird last night.Sorry about the length of this, thougth you might not know the story. It reminds me of Clever Grethel. ;I agree with you! As stated in the videos, we have to pay attention to what we are reading and write about something that interested us, no matter if we use one, two or more of the tales to prove our point.;It is easier to find retold or modernized fairy tales in the form of novels (Robin McKinley&apos;s Beauty or Alex Flinn&apos;s Beastly), ad Angela Carter&apos;s books are full of fairy tale allusions, you could even consider those books as fairy tales on their own!;Fairy tales have become literary motifs.;</string>
            <string>I do think one or two of the people who commented on my essay didn&apos;t give it a number:   Little  Red Riding Hood    is one of the most known fairy-tales, and even when  there are different settings, versions and retellings, the story remains  the same, with some changes in the ending. It has been made into a  dark, yet funny one, such as Roald Dahl   s rhyme    Little Red Riding Hood  and the Wolf   . There are the ones where Little Red Riding Hood is saved  from the wolf   s stomach by either a huntsman or her own father, like in  John B. Gruelle and the Lower Lusatia   s versions; or not eaten at all,  like in Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm   s story, &quot;Little Red Cap&quot;, where the  girl goes    cheerfully home, and came to no harm   . And even the ones  where she escapes on her own, like in the French tale,    The  Grandmother,    where she flees to her own house. But there are also the  darker versions, where Little Red Riding Hood is not saved at all, and  she ends up being eaten by the wolf, like in Charles Perrault   s. Finally, some retellings may be darker by introducing supernatural  beings such as werewolves. They are a combination of human and beast;  they have their ambitions, intuitions, and senses. An example of this is  Angela Carter   s    The Company of Wolves   , where it could seem quite  obvious that the charming young man dressed as a hunter was the evil  creature, there is a predisposition to which the charming ones end up  being the wicked ones (take Wickham in Jane Austen   s Pride and Prejudice,  for example). But we do not expect his tenderness towards the girl, as     sweet and sound she sleeps in granny   s bed, between the paws of the  tender wolf    (220). In conclusion, the way the ending is told is what  changes the story   s effect, and it does not matter how happy, sad or  dark it is, the story remains the same.Works cited:Carter, Angela.

Always put your bottom line  punctuation inside quotation marks: &quot;The Company of Wolves,&quot; You did a  nice job citing your sources and writing your citation.

I feel if the prompt was to talk about the  archetype of fairy tales over many time periods and authors then your  essay would have been not so out of place. In addition the essay  includes almost nothing about the actual Grimm story. peer 3      You demonstrate you familiarity with the story in different forms, but  risk going beyond the scope of the assignment and off on a tangent. I  would&apos;ve liked to have read more about how you felt the Grimm&apos;s version  fit in context and what this signified about the work.peer 4      You did a good job using concrete examples. I feel like your essay  could have been a bit longer. Also a detect a bit of logical discrepency  in your argument. You are very clear about textual variations, however,  your last sentence argues the story is always the same. It is possible  you are English second language, so I will not harp too much on word  choice. But if it were me, and my goal was to improve my writing, then I  would avoid using overworked words: sad, dark, same, goes, etc. You did  well with words like predisposition, tenderness, etc.Score from your peers: 1.5peer 2      Your writing is definitely solid (much better than mine), but i think  you would benefit greatly from rereading the prompt and especially the  part about not writing about things &quot;that fall outside the course  reading&quot;.

            <string>So, would Utopian and Dystopian stories be considered Sci-Fi and Fantasy? I consider them in that genre. There are usually elements of both in the story, at some point. Even if it is a subdued future.  If you consider it in this genre, what are your favorites?;</string>
            <string>Consider this. In one of  Ray Bradbury&apos;s stories (I can&apos;t remember the name), the human race is forced to move to the planet Venus. In the story, Venus is described as being in a state of eternal torrential  downpour. The sun only shines for five minutes every few years. When the sun does shine, Venus is described as a paradise. While some of my details are probably inaccurate since I haven&apos;t read this story in sometime, and I may have added some information that is irrelevant toward the topic of this thread; I do have a point. My point is this: this story is definitely a work of science fiction, but can it be considered a dystopian or utopian story?;I enjoy his work a lot. About the design I like watching how it has changed throughout the years, Mononoke Hime being my favorite one in that regard followed by Chihiro.;</string>
            <string>I think that yes, utopias and dystopias are definitely fantasy. I haven&apos;t read many pure utopia type books, but I have read many dystopias. I think that a lot of dystopia stories get into sci-fi territory in their world building. Most of them are set in the far future where some catastrophic event has caused _____ to happen and all kinds of new technology is needed to survive. ;Genres are not so much boxes that contain and limit  as they are  puddles, reaching out and melting across attempts to  define borders.  Sci-fi/fantasy is particularly good at this because it&apos;s a built-in mechanism, anything is possible from imagining King Arthur  returning to save England in WW2, to  Joss Whedon&apos;s Buffy and Firefly series.Yes! This! There&apos;s a tendency to try to categorise, but the very best fiction blurs and merges genres.One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley&apos;s Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently &quot;lost&quot;.   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as &quot;science&quot; ...      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the &quot;real world&quot;,  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, Peter Dickinson and the great Ursula Le Guin and Octavia Butler have all done this very effectively.I tend to assume that all utopian/dystopian fiction is fantasy, in that it imagines a society not yet built - though it may have its roots here and now - and which may also be sci-fi, depending on the way issues of technology are approached.  ;</string>
            <string>Utopia and Dystopia are the two extremes one can push a fictional world into. One we hope for in reality, and one we fear. They are both definitely fantastic, though I think that if some non-existent science is at the core of -why- they are those ways, it&apos;s Sci-Fi. For Utopian, my fallback short-story is &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&quot; and Dystopia, &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;. ;This is a hilarious thread. I only wish I had something super witty to add to it.  ;I agree Atwood should be here, too.   Oryx and Crake definitely has some fairy tale elements.   I will have to check out the other two authors, haven&apos;t read any of their work before.  ;Rabbits have long been associated with fertility and spring (think Easter bunnies and maypoles), so definitely a tale about sex; Greg, spot on with the warning over pre-marital sex.   It did strike me as roll-your-eyes kind of funny that the idiot rabbit didn&apos;t even spot that his &quot;wife&quot; was a straw figure, a fake, the wrong one; a great many of the tales feature similar situations where the prince/male is completely fooled by sometimes highly transparent  transformations and disguises, and is unable to recognise his own wife.   I think that says something about male/female relations and the way women were/are viewed by men (please excuse the generalisation, I&apos;m tired).  ;In Pagan traditions, white, red and black indicate the Triple Goddess - white for the Maiden, purity, innocence, beginnings; red for the Mother, menstrual/birthing blood, experience, maturity; and black for the Crone, the wise woman, the horrible hag associated with wisdom, death, winter.   I find it interesting to re-read certain tales such as Snow White with this in mind.;Some academics have also linked the use of the number 3 - in addition to the colours white, red and black, and the turn of the seasons  - to the Pagan traditions which invoke the Goddess as a trinity or triple aspect.   With regards to the colours, white corresponds to the Maiden representing innocence and beginnings; red to the Mother representing menstrual/birthing blood, experience and maturity; and black for the Crone, the wise woman, the hag who brings wisdom and death/transformation.;</string>
            <string>In terms of changing form, I think Stoker is implying from old to young, after sleeping in the earth from his homeland.   Helsing also says at one point that he has the powers of the wind and the creatures of the earth, so I believe his abilities to change to bats, etc, are a offshoot of that.   As for travelling during the day, I&apos;m not sure what chapter, but Helsing also says something like, &quot;Contrary to popular belief, vampires can travel during the day&quot;   He tells us that their powers are severely limited.   Stoker was taking oral folk tales and committing them to a text.   He kept what he wanted and tossed the rest, as other authors have continued to do with each new vampire story that comes out.;This novel was a Victorian novel.   Immigration to England and various parts of Western Europe was at an all time high, and one of the largest portions of immigrants were Eastern Europeans, gypsies and the likes.   They looked very different from the English and the French, and had very different customs.     Victorian novels always explore the dark side of Victorian life, and this is another way of showing their fear of what is not them--the immigrants, by making this part of the world uncivilized.;I think the homosexuality element is not present in Stoker&apos;s book, but later authors have played that up.   Specifically, Anne Rice&apos;s Interview with a Vampire series.   In that book, clearly the relationship between Louis and Armand is very sexually charged, and the majority of vampires in the book are male.     I agree that Stoker&apos;s is completely hetero, but because vampires are such sexual creatures, they have morphed and changed over time, just as sexuality and acceptance of sexuality have changed.;</string>
            <string>I guess part of Gulliver&apos;s adventures are distinctly utopian. What do you think of this? ;</string>
            <string>I agree.   There can be overlaps, surely, but not all utopian or distopian fiction is sci fi.   Of course some can be, but I don&apos;t think it is necessary.   I think sci fi has to have some basis in science, and that science is defined as human action, experiementation, exploration, etc. upon nature whereas fantasy is what the world creates that humans then have to negotiate, endure, face, conquer or to co-exist with what nature has produced.   This is a very simplistic way of distinguishing to the, but I think all labels are subjective, not necessarily exact.;</string>

            <string>The truth is, some fantasy and science fiction novels were categorized as popular literature at the time they firstly publishedIsn&apos;t it bizarre that sci-fi and fantasy have become &quot;niche&quot; genres in our culture while being tremendously influential? Every now and then a publisher realises they&apos;ve got a &quot;genre&quot; book/series (how I loathe the term &quot;genre&quot; being used as code for &quot;not proper literature&quot;) that will work in the mainstream - Pullman&apos;s Dark Materials, Collins&apos; Hunger Games - and it baffles me that they&apos;re so wedded to the idea that sci-fi/fantasy is a minority interest that they continue to treat it that way despite all the evidence to the contrary. We keep going back to sci-fi, fantasy, the supernatural in films and tv. Never a year goes by without some huge superhero, military sci-fi, or supernatural blockbuster.;</string>
            <string>I second this recommendation and also its companion books, Gathering Blue and The Messenger. It expands on the story and the characters. The Giver made me cry a bit. I&apos;m not going to lie.;</string>

            <string>These stories were not meant for children. People always associate fairy tales with children, and that is incorrect.;I love these tales. I find them fascinating. If you think this is bad, you should read Hans Christian Andersen! The real story of the Little Mermaid is very depressing. But I have always loved fairy tales, be it Grimm Brothers or Disney or Anderson. I think every version has something different to offer, a different purpose. I enjoyed this reading assignment very much.;That is awful. =( I had some essays that analyzed something completely different than I did in the story, but I simply graded them on if they explained it well and had relevant examples. Everyone is going to take something different from the readings.  ;I received a 4, which is around what   I expected. I used to be very good at analyzing and writing, but then I majored in science so I have fallen out of practice. While I disagreed with some of the comments, I think they are helpful. I will only say that it is important to remember when grading - the matter is not whether you AGREE with the essay&apos;s thesis or not, but rather if the author makes a logical argument and backs it up with examples.  ;</string>

            <string>A thesis is important. Without it, you ramble and confuse the reader. I would like to point out that I was always taught NOT to say &quot;My thesis is&quot; or &quot;I think that&quot; or &quot;I believe&quot;. A good thesis is simply stated.  Also, as Alan said, it doesn&apos;t have to be a single thesis but at the start of a new idea you have to introduce it somehow. I would still count this as a sort of thesis if it was properly done. Two of the essays I graded this time needed a clear thesis.;I understand you must be frustrated, but that is a valid point. I know there is a word count, but a good writer can say a lot in a very short essay. They probably didn&apos;t mean your essay had to be longer, just more rich. Perhaps you have too much &quot;fluff&quot; in your essay and you need to make your words count more. I have seen many good essays with well developed ideas; I have also seen people use quotes five lines long and not make their point clearly.  ;I am loving this course too. I love to read but I do not know how to analyze as well as I would like, and I have no one to discuss books in depth with. I think it is amazing I can hear such an expert&apos;s opinion and learn from so many people. I think I already pay more attention when I read.;</string>

            <string>The Discworld books are awesome, and they&apos;re generally written around various characters or locations: the Witches books, the Death books (although Death makes an appearance in every book), the City Watch novels, etc.   There&apos;s a couple of standalone books, and there&apos;s also a short series of young adult novels (which are related to the Witches novels, but they stand alone well).   I would start with Small Gods (standalone), Guards! Guards! (City Watch), or The Wee Free Men  (young adult).   Another approach is simply to read them in the order that they were written in, since none of the later books are written to be read before an earlier novel.   If you really want to get into it, there&apos;s an awesome reading guide for all of the books, short stories, and related works.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;ve read some good essays and some bad essays.   I read one essay where I&apos;m pretty sure that I spent more time evaluating it than the student did writing it.   I make sure that my comments are direct, to the point, and actionable.   The commentary that I&apos;ve gotten on my own essays has been reasonably good.   There were a couple of responses that gave very little feedback, but overall I felt that the comments provided by my fellow students have been fair, accurate, and meaningful.I would guess that the people who don&apos;t bother writing very good essays or giving very good feedback are probably not paying attention to the class forums.  ;</string>

            <string>I&apos;m a pretty voracious reader and have always loved fantasy, but have multiple failed attempts at Alice. Re-reading it now, I felt a deja-vu sense of irritation. Alice is an idiot.   She manages to offend almost everyone she meets. I don&apos;t find her a very sympathetic character. The whimsy and word play are entertaining, but I&apos;m hoping that I will come away with a deeper respect for this book. Right now, I&apos;m still pretty uninvested.;I got the annotated version from the library and that has definitely been helping!;I disagree. I love chaos, nonsense and whimsy. I read lots of fantasy and science fiction.   I&apos;ve always found it very hard to connect with these books in an emotional way.;</string>
            <string>I think there is a clear association between Christianity, England, and purity, both physical and spiritual in Dracula.   The Count is set up in opposition, dark, foreign, lustful, averse to the cross and the host.   It&apos;s not completely coincidental that Bela Lugosi wore a Star of David when he played the title role.   Even though there is no evidence Bram Stoker was anti Semitic, and some evidence to the contrary, I do think the fears he conjures are related to fears of Jews and foreigners.   Jews were frequently accused of using the blood of Christian children for ritual, &quot;the blood libel,&quot; when Judaism strictly forbids ingesting blood of any kind.;</string>

            <string>Thanks, I&apos;ve sent a request to join;I just found the Facebook group for this course.   ;</string>
            <string>This is the second time I am taking this course,I   just took a look at my peers&apos; feedback to my essay and I am delighted by the great feedback I got. My excitement has nothing to do with the grade I got. In fact, I got the same grade than last time. No, my excitement is due to my reviewer&apos;s dilegence when providing me with useful comments and ideas about how to improve my piece.This is truly   a breath of fresh air, since last time there were   lots of complains in the facebook group for   the   poor peer review taking place.It&apos;s not only the peer review that has gotten better, the essays   got were also a lot better than last time.I know it is too soon to tell, but I just hope to keep getting comments as well thought as I did this time.I want to thank my reviewers since their feedback will help me become a stronger writer and A better critical thinker.This is what my peers said about my essay:FORMpeer 1      Good form and vocabulary but some grammatical errors should be corrected and a bit more editing is needed. As examples:    When it comes to women    needs a comma after the phrase;    stereotypes: the good one and the bad one.    might be better said as simply    the good and the bad.    More editing is needed.peer 2      Great work on citing all the sources you used! A few things to note are comma and colon usage, word choice, and phrasing. I would suggest looking up comma usage in the MLA or APA handbook if you have them available. They are very useful in assisting writers in their own editing. Be cautious of word choice. Some of your sentences get a little lost due to words such as &quot;to be&quot; (is, are, was). Also, your phrasing in some of your sentences sounds a little off. A trick I use when writing is to read my sentences out loud. Most often, if they sound funny, they&apos;ve been written funny. Going back and reediting your work several times is the best way to catch many of these little mistakes.peer 3      Your written English is fairly good, and you&apos;re able to convey your meaning most of the time. There is room for improvement, with sentences such as, &quot;the Grimms did not complicate themselves by given them too much thought.&quot; Does this mean that the Grimms didn&apos;t create complex characters who were able to think deeply, or that the Grimms themselves didn&apos;t complicate their task by thinking deeply about the characters? Your sentence structures aren&apos;t always strong, though your spelling is excellent, and the essay is generally understandable. Your citation of Bruce&apos;s work is clear and well placed. The essay structure is weakened by a lack of focus. You cleverly give solid, concrete examples of behaviour that support your overall argument; yet they range across such a broad spectrum that it is hard to follow the thread of your argument. Given the word limit, it might help to pick out one strand of misogyny - beauty and gentleness OR passivity OR suffering, for example - so as to build a more focused argument.peer 4      The structure is good over all except for some grammatical mistakes, such as &apos;give&apos; should be &apos;giving in second line, and some others. The division into three parts is good in keeping the detail of each part separate although the general theme runs through them (gender.)CONTENTpeer 1      I wonder if you proved your thesis on the characterization of the female. Your argument selects a number of good examples and does make a point. However, it was not the Grimm Brothers who were at fault for the stories&apos; viewpoint. They were collectors and only wrote what was the prevailing attitude.peer 2      I totally agree with the misogynistic aspects of the Grimm&apos;s Brother&apos;s work. They don&apos;t really seem to cut women much of a break, do they? However, your essay lacks a full thesis statement. I get what you are trying to argue, but you never state you&apos;re arguing that the Brother&apos;s Grimm stories&apos; were intentionally written to put women in their place. A strong and concise thesis statement might also give your essay a little more structure and direction.peer 3      The overall argument of misogyny in the tales is supported by excellent use of concrete examples of misogyny from specific stories. The weak structure of the essay makes it hard to follow the thread of the argument from beginning to end, though the basic idea of misogyny in the tales is clearly conveyed. I am unsure whether you mean to say that the Grimms themselves are the source of the misogyny within the stories, or that the stories reflect social standards of the time which go unchallenged by the Grimms, so being clear about this would be helpful. By focusing on one or two aspects of misogyny in the tales you would significantly strengthen your thesis.peer 4      The content is very good. For one I was not aware of that general theme until I read the essay (misogyny) The examples given from many essays are illuminating and they refer to the traditional gender roles prevalent in all cultures, old and new.COMMENTSpeer 1      Good job... Your essay did get me thinking and I was also struck by the way women were typed in these stories.peer 3      My hope is that you&apos;ll find these comments helpful rather than disheartening. You&apos;ve clearly got strong ideas about the tales, and your essay has the potential to be really good with some polishing. I&apos;d like to say that I was delighted and very amused by the sentence, &quot;This princess was beautiful and gentle and probably also mentally challenged&quot;, which both pointed out the shallow characterisation of the princess and conveyed a wry humour about it.By the way,  I am still part of the facebook group from the   previous time which    has gotten bigger with new members taking the current iteration. These members are quieter than the previous ones, but   they seem to me far more commited to make the most out this course.http://www.facebook.com/groups/246393752160589/;</string>

            <string>This is the third time I am experiencing this; after submitting my well-formatted essay, somehow the whole thing will join together making the essay a single paragraph instead of three. This has been the complaint of all the peers who reviewed my work, and it&apos;s giving me serious concern because one way or other, its affecting my marks. Please I need advice on this. ;Thanks so much, Patricia and Andreja. I&apos;ll try that. It&apos;s nice of you guys to take time to respond. I appreciate.;</string>
            <string>Hey Pete, I was the one I recommended that group in the first place. I left the group yesterday, because there was nothing going on. I have joined Carol&apos;s and I quite certain it is going to be full with   mature people comitted to the course and to   the discussions of the works.;Done! Phew.. Excellent novel. I like that Van Helsing is a thoughtful, intelligent protagonist, rather than a quixotic action hero that I assumed him to be. So many essay topics....... ;I agree. If my thesis was, &quot;the protagonist of Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland isn&apos;t really named Alice,&quot; I could easily provide examples of times where she forgot who she was and times where she was referred to as &quot;a girl&quot; or other descriptive titles. Not only would you disagree with me, but my argument would be ignoring the many times she is specifically called Alice. It would take a compelling argument to make this thesis even debatable.On the other hand, I had a couple of essays that were completely incoherent and had no thesis at all. If someone has a poor thesis, but it is organized well and the author attempted a well-thought out argument, I give it a 2.;5.5 is an incredible score. Let me try and be critical so you can continue to improve. Form: Sentence structure good and thesis clear. Sentences flow well together. Here are some nits: Commas and periods should go inside the quotes.  &quot;Time works different[LY] for him...&quot; &quot;She is explained&quot; is improper word usage. It implies &quot;she&quot; is the one being explained. You could use &quot;she is told.&quot; A comma is the wrong punctuation after &quot;cut afterwards.&quot; Maybe an em-dash or colon? Content: Your thesis is strong and you did a nice job of citing examples to form your argument. Is it a mirror paradigm? Or perhaps she has learned from past experiences and is continuing her progression. There are many mirror elements in LGLand, but why is it the milieu that changes Alice&apos;s perception? ~ Critiques aside, I found this essay better than the ones I formally critiqued and would have given it 2+3, even though I am not fully convinced that the setting was tied to her shift in worldview.;Here&apos;s mine. Score is 2+2=4. I&apos;m happy, but want to improve. A common theme in Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass is the progression of childhood into adulthood, but the immaturity and irrationality of the adult figures show that Alice&apos;s vision of adulthood is often misleading. One of the best examples of Alice encountering immature adults is in Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland during a tea party. The March Hare, the Hatter, and a dormouse are present and they contradict Alice with every remark to the point of absurdity. A tea party is often seen as a sophisticated pastime, but the three characters are juvenile in their behavior. The blending of the tea party with childish behaviors raises questions for Alice what it means to be an adult. Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated. The king tries to pacify her, but he too fails to exhibit adult-like behavior by giving illogical arguments in a court proceeding. Alice later realizes that the highest authorities in the land are nothing but a deck of cards. Through the Looking-Glass also demonstrates the irrationality of adulthood. One example of this is in the poem, &quot;Jabberwocky.&quot; Carroll uses fictitious words to parody the contemporary poetry and intellectualism of the time. Only Humpty Dumpty, the modern intellectual of Alice&apos;s dream, has the capacity to understand the poem. Ironically, he is a nursery rhyme character and is foolish enough to sit on a wall that he knows he may fall from. Even intellectuals are depicted as childish without common sense. The juvenile renderings of the events and characters in Alice&apos;s dreams raise into question the meaning of adulthood. As much as these stories tell of a girl growing up, they show that adults regularly exhibit child-like behaviors. Works cited  Carroll, Lewis. Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland, New York: MacMillan. (1865) Carroll, Lewis. Through the Looking-Glass, New York: MacMillan. (1871) Form  peer 1     I like the structure of your essay. There is a clear introduction sentence in which you describe the topic analyzed, and your arguments are convincing and confirm your theory. The grammar is correct and the essay well-written.  peer 2     Form and structure are clear, but could be more sophisticated. It is not so clear, what really should be the point: Alices journey to adulthood? The immaturity of adults? The immaturity of adults as Alice dreams them up? Longer parts of the essay are just re-telling of the story. Since length of the essays are so severly limited, it would have been essential to more deeply develop the analysis than retell the story.  peer 3     The essay is well structured and effective. Nothing negative to say.  peer 4     Excellent writing and structure  peer 5     Well formed. If you use a quote from the book make sure you use quotation marks.  peer 6     Your form is very good. You explain much without seeming like you are hopping around. Content:  peer 1     Your essay exposes and develops a thesis, and successfully supports it with examples from different parts of the books. However, there are some fragments too descriptive, like this one:    Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated.    We already knew it, so you could have focused into the lack of adult-like behavior displayed by the king and the whole court.  peer 2     The journey to adulthood is an important topic of Carroll&apos;s books, many essays point to this. I am not so convinced about the point of immaturity of adults (which is a bit unclear in itself). The depicted &quot;immaturity&quot; could also be read as a hint to Alice&apos;s immaturity (it is she, after all, who dreams up the story).  peer 3     You make an interesting observation of the meaning of adulthood from a child   s point of view, which is genuine and show critical thinking. Although you should go deeper into the subject, since you give the examples but you don   t really develop your thesis.  peer 4     Terrific thesis, supporting details and analysis from throughout the text!  peer 5     I&apos;m not sure about your comment &apos;Alice&apos;s vision of adulthood is misleading&apos;. Do you mean that she saw adults as logical until she entered wonderland where that premise is put into question? I&apos;m not sure how true that is, I think she found adults dull but not necessarily logical, she didn&apos;t understand adults in the normal world either. I agree that Carrol brings into question the rigid division between adult and child.  peer 6     I like your concept of the stories, however I do disagree with you. I found that it was Alice that was immature, rude and argumentative. But alas, I&apos;m not here to grade our difference of opinions but how well you performed your essay. I feel you did very well. ;There is definitely hidden meaning in the fact that Van Helsing and Seward keep the &quot;transfusions&quot; a secret.Another comment, perhaps unrelated, is that many people in the time period would die from blood transfusions. Do we really know that Lucy died from Dracula&apos;s poison? More specifically, did Dracula intend for her to turn so quickly? As a vampire, she is no longer a form of sustenance for him.;I didn&apos;t mind Atlas Shrugged, aside from the 60 page (!) speech proselytizing objectivism. The Fountainhead was much better. I have her book on writing fiction and if you thought her novel was heavy-handed, you would groan all the more at her approach to writing fiction. Even the buildings are purposeful in expressing her ideologies.;I think it all depends on what you want to accomplish with your writing. If you are creating an escapist adventure or good beach read, then perhaps symbolism plays a lesser role and deep critical analysis is less important. If your writing is meant to express your ideologies in a way that people can relate to, then it would be beneficial to understand how symbolism is woven into classic novels. My favorite author is Gene Wolfe and his writing has puzzles within puzzles, unreliable narrators, and several levels of symbolism. I enjoy rereading his work, each time peeling back another layer of the onion. I enjoy it and could only dream of replicating some of his best works. For other people, they enjoy the reading and writing experience for all together different reasons. There is no right answer.;I&apos;m going to try and read everything (we&apos;ll see how long it lasts!). Dracula was tough to finish, but having already read Frankenstein, I may read more quickly through it this time.The books I&apos;m most interested in are the more contemporary works, like Bradbury and LeGuin.;There&apos;s already a thread for this topic:https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=289;Interesting topic... I don&apos;t think the novel is meant to downplay either faith or science -- they work hand-in-hand. Lucy is rejuvinated by blood transfusions. The Christian objects seem to have their power in the objects themselves rather than in the faith in those using them. It is no mistake that they are Christian objects as vampires are the antithesis of Christianity (in their form of communion, getting power from darkness, drinking of blood, which has sexual connotations).Van Helsing is the one who tells Mina that her scar will only be temprorary -- I never thought of him as  a Father figure, but he would be the closest one to it.;I lucked out this time. All are pretty good, in sharp contrast to last time. No ones and a couple of threes coming. ;I was under the impression that the mad man (his name escapes me at the moment) invited Dracula into the home where Mina was staying rather then her initiating the invitation. ;My take -- It shows Lucy as a mother figure and sets up a social hierarchy. The three women with Dracula were not allowed to have Harker and settled for a child. I almost wonder if it is masoginistic in that the new women cannot achieve free reign even in their nonconformity to Victorian ideals. Not sure on this one... ;I&apos;ve read  three or four  novellas by him and several short stories. I am Legend is probably my favorite. I absolutely loved the ending -- especially the last sentence. I have the Library of America&apos;s Classic SF Novels of the 50s collection (which includes The Shrinking Man) -- surprisingly, I haven&apos;t gotten around to reading that story yet.One of the most memorable Twilight Zone  episodes I remember (watching as a child) was Button Button -- one of his short stories. I didn&apos;t watch his Star Trek episodes, but surely plan on checking them out.He will be missed and many of his stories are still as relevant today as they were when he wrote them.;</string>
            <string>Here&apos;s mine. I had the advantage (?) of only getting three reviews, but after getting a 3.5 and a 4, I&apos;ll take it.In Bram Stoker&apos;s  Dracula, the communion wafer, or  host, is an anathema to the vampires&apos; vitality. Despite being human, Mina screams when Van Helsing touches a host to her forehead. It &quot;burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal.&quot; The remaining scar is an external sign of her exile from Victorian society into Dracula&apos;s caste and God&apos;s protection over her.Before commenting on the scar, it is important to consider the cause of it -- namely, the host. In Catholic tradition, the host is the transmuted body of Christ and by partaking of it, the believer shares in Christ&apos;s death and resurrection and thus shares in his eternal life. However, as the Apostle Paul notes, &quot;he that eateth ... unworthily, eateth ... damnation to himself.&quot; The host has both healing and destructive properties and it is Mina&apos;s poisoned blood that causes the wound to form.  The scar forms a red circle on Mina&apos;s white forehead (a stain on pure skin), causing her to wail, &quot;Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!&quot;  God&apos;s rejection of Mina parallels his rejection of Cain in  Genesis. After Cain spilled his brother&apos;s blood, he was was cursed from the earth and forced to live in exile. Cain realized his pending doom, so God placed a  mark  of protection over him.  The placing of the host on Mina serves as a protection from Dracula; however, the scar also marks her exile from Victorian society. When a neighbor woman sees her, she makes the sign of the cross to ward off Mina&apos;s  evil eye.Mina&apos;s scar also signifies her kinship with Dracula, who likewise bears a scar on his own forehead. As long as Dracula lives, Mina&apos;s scar remains a sign of their sinful union. Van Helsing promises Mina that it is only temporal and the scar and all that it represents will disappear when Dracula is killed.;Some other thoughts: &quot;He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion.&quot; It seems Aylmer sees Georgiana more as a subject than a wife (albeit slightly).  Aylmer refers to his servant as a clod and earthly mass and in the end it is &quot;Mother Nature&quot; who gets the last laugh. I don&apos;t see this as much about pursuing perfection as I see it as a battle between a man&apos;s two loves, namely his wife and science. Of course, the pursuit of perfection is much of what science is about. ;First, on peer grading -- the most value is in the critiquing itself: learning how to analyze other essays critically while enhancing your own knowledge of the novel. Some people are less advanced and you can provide meaningful feedback. Others are more advanced and you can learn and give the best feedback you can. I&apos;m not a professional reviewer or a teacher, but I try to give meaningful feedback (whether or not it is is debatable). But this process and the writing of the essay itself is where I progress the most. I like that the lectures are broken into segments so I can watch them throughout the week at my leisure. I think Professor Rabkin has many great insights and like all literary analysis, there always can be points of contention. He has a passion and knowledge of the subject matter that provide great value to the student. I feel no need to anonymously air my quibbles. But even with the great deal of complaining, I thoroughly enjoy the discussion boards. Without them there would be no way to ask questions. No way to interact. No way to have a class community. I am enjoying the class and am enthusiastic to progress to more modern texts like Bradbury, LeGuin, and Doctorow, where my greater interests lie. I was surprised how much I liked Dracula and even though I have read the other texts thus far, I have enjoyed digging deeper into them. This class has been everything I&apos;ve wanted and more and is a real treat to enjoy for free. ;</string>
            <string>Very ironic. I got 4 essays strictly on Poe and 1 essay strictly on Hawthorne. I was very disappointed not to see any examining the two authors. It is not by accident that we read both in the same lesson.;</string>
            <string>Very insightful, Rebecca, thanks.;</string>
            <string>You all are reading some fantastic stuff! I am reading Grimm&apos;s of course and the Fall of Arthur by J.R.R. Tolkien. Next on my list is Horns by Joe Hill. I am intrigued by him .. . I just finished Inferno by Dan Brown. Oh and I&apos;m also reading The Map of the Sky by Felix J. Palma. Palma is one my favorite contemporary authors. The Map of Time (first in the series) was absolutely brilliant!;</string>
            <string>That is a very interesting question. I will have to read more Alice to have an answer.  ;Yes Wonderland has definable laws; however, while reading from a baffled little girl&apos;s perspective, it seems chaotic, especially in the beginning when she is trying to get a grasp on the &quot;laws.&quot; ;My advice to those of you who believe these books are complete nonsense, is to read the annotated version. The information in the margins grounds the story in the reality of Victorian times. Many of the things that seem to make no sense to us, made a lot of sense to the English Victorians. Personally I love nonsense, especially when it&apos;s soaked in British-ness and served with Victorian glaze. Yum!;Lewis Carrol received many letters begging him to answer the riddle and as it had no answer when he wrote it, he made different things up. My favorite is &quot;because they both produce very flat notes.&quot;HA!;I think of it like I think of those movies that are made up of &quot;documentary&quot; footage from various sources. It seems to me to be the pre-camera version of that type of storytelling.;</string>

            <string>Since there are quite a few threads where people are complaining about peer reviews, time constraints, etc. . . I just wanted to say that I think this course is awesome!  I have loved all the readings and writing the essays. I also love reading other students&apos; essays and reviewing them.  The best part of all this is that Coursera, the University of Michigan, and Professor Rabkin have provided us with such an amazing opportunity!  Let&apos;s talk about how wonderful this is! What a brilliant time we live in . ..  ;</string>
            <string>Hi Cheri, your comment made me think there might also be a background effect in taking pleasure out of these. I clearly remember spending many hours in a sunlit room as a little child, where my great grandma recounted many stories similar to these. Somehow the pleasure of her acting and singing the fairy tale characters is woven into my psyche. Your comment makes me wonder how much that experience is to credit for the pleasure I take from these tales.Thanks;</string>
            <string>On the surface, many of these tales seem far from a moral lesson. At least in the sense that we would understand them today. But I think that part of this is simply a cultural construct; we are so used to morality tales following the formula of &quot;righteous character is triumphant and succeeds, and wicked character gets just desserts&quot; that we have difficulty seeing the lesson in a tale that takes different forms. In the time that these tales developed, community was the fundamental rock of survival. The actions of one person could unravel the fabric of their society. Take for instance &quot;The Death of the Hen.&quot; On the surface, this seems to be more a tale of   senseless injustice than a framework for right living. However, if we understand that it is meant more as a cautionary tale for lack of morality it makes a bit more sense. In a time when survival was often the only reward for being a morally upright person, this sort of tale would make far more sense to the average person than one of rags to riches; keep in mind that these were the tales of the common man, not the literati. Hence the name Hausm _rchen. With &quot;The Death of the Hen,&quot; the importance of honor and duty to community are emphasized. In addition, the interconnected of a community&apos;s members is also stressed. It is because the Hen, in her gluttony (a sin) breaks her oath, which in turn sets of a cascade of tragic events that ultimately destroys the community. We see this in the very delineated way in which the events progress, e.g., the Cock goes to the Brook to get some water for the choking hen, then goes to the Bride to get some silk, then to the willow to get the garland. All of these events and the ones that lead up to everyone&apos;s death are set in motion by the seemingly inconsequential action of the Hen breaking her oath. But in the times in which these stories developed, lack of commitment and faithfulness to one&apos;s community often meant death for that community, even the original transgression was not done out of malice. This is summed up by the last line: &quot;And they were all dead together&quot; (emphasis added).This sense of honor and duty are fundamental German virtues. So while the story does indeed have a tragic ending, that tragic ending is brought about by the failure to live up to the morality of the community. In this way the moral lesson is taught through what is lost, rather than what is gained.   ;Hello! I&apos;m from Chicago too. Well, the Western suburbs, to be more precise.  ;</string>
            <string>Interesting discussion! I haven&apos;t finished reading yet, but I don&apos;t like those tales either, I&apos;m more on Andersen, which I read as a child. I&apos;m guessing the heritage of childhood must be important in how a tale makes us feel. Cheri I agree with your analysis on the morality of those stories. For the dads I would even go further, not only are they useless, but they even are dangerous in some stories! I&apos;m thinking of &quot;The 12 brothers&quot;, in which the king wants to kill the boys if he has a girl. Or in &quot;Faithful John&quot; in which he doesn&apos;t hesitate to cut his twins&apos; heads to release John. Was I the only one shocked? What message is there suppose to lie under these stories? The all mighty power of the father on his children? ;</string>
            <string>The message I took away from this tale was the rejection of worldly in favor on inner happiness. The more Hans gives away the happier he becomes. It is interesting that the items he begins and ends with are both stones which weigh him down. The first, though a lump of gold, is still a burden which he casts off. The grindstone meets a similar fate. I think this is to illustrate that material possessions, no matter how costly, are still fetters that hold people back from true happiness. Eastern thought might say that Hans exemplifies mindfulness, in that he is perfectly present in each moment he experiences and is equally happy in each. Not once does Hans seem to regret any of the trades he&apos;s made. After losing all of these material items, the tale states that &quot;on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother&apos;s &quot; house. It is in giving up the attachment to the material that he is able to return to &quot;his mother&apos;s house.&quot; Perhaps his mother&apos;s house is a metaphor for returning to that pure and unadulterated spiritual state which we all come from. Indeed Hans&apos; childlike nature has a certain innocence and purity to it which is often associated with spiritual perfection. Indeed, the number seven is repeated in this story, firstly in the number of years in which Hans works for his master, and in the number of items which he relinquishes. Seven itself is often associated with a spiritual journey through its relationship to the Seven Days of Creation. &quot;And on the Seventh day he rested.&quot; Hans rests from his work after seven years, and then rests from his cares after giving up the seventh object. ;Each trade has some sort of catch to it. The horse throws him, the cow kicks him, the pig is stolen. When there isn&apos;t a draw back, and if there isn&apos;t, then Hans is at best not satisfied for long. He&apos;s stuck in a state of perpetual striving until he lets go of the possessions. I think the point here is really that possessions do not bring happiness, and also that the more you have, the more you have to worry about. ;This is an interesting line of thought, and may well have spoken to the story&apos;s intended audience. The idea of &quot;For everything there is a season, and a purpose under Heaven&quot; would have resonated with the medieval mind and would have reinforced the value of patience in the knowledge that &quot;the Lord provides.&quot; The only problem with this interpretation, however, is that Hans never actually derived use from any of the items he traded for. With the exception of the Horse, which only served him briefly (and poorly at that) the items were all used to further advance materialism; there was no need that was actually satisfied. ;The birds are not aware of God providing for them either, yet He does. Indeed Hans is much like a little child, and in that respect he has entered the Kingdom of Heaven through his casting off of worldly concerns. ;This tale seemed to me to be one of chastity and diligence in one&apos;s spiritual vows. The setting is a garden of cabbages. This would seem to indicate a cloister of celibate women; the cabbage could well be a metaphor for the female anatomy, while the garden represents an isolation of that virtue from the rest of the world. The mother could be representative of the Mother Superior of an order, or perhaps the Virgin Mary. The rabbit, of course, has historically been associated with lust, given it&apos;s notorious fertility. His pleas to have the maiden &quot;sit on his tail&quot; have very strong phallic connotations. Three times the girl gives in more and more to the rabbit until she relents and follows him to his hutch. This could perhaps be associated with Peter denying Christ three times. The girl refusing to follow the rabbit to the wedding three times could be associated with the three temptations of Christ. When she denies the temptation for the third and final time, she leaves behind only a husk of herself, a doppelganger made out of straw. Straw is often associated with the worldly in folk tales, as opposed to gold which is associated with the spiritual. So while the girl has left behind that part of herself which is concerned with the mundane world, she has, through her final denial of the temptations been able to return to her &quot;mother&quot; and the spiritual concerns of the cloister, and is thus triumphant over sin.   ;This tale seemed to me to be one of chastity and diligence in one&apos;s  spiritual vows.

In fact this would have been a theme many people would have been familiar with, at least through a &quot;friend of a friend&quot;. When a woman would become pregnant outside of wedlock she could obe taken to a nunnery. So, even though she had transgressed originally, she could, through renunciation by becoming a bride of Christ, be redeemed. ;Admittedly, these are not clear-cut stories. I suggest that she refused his advances initially, then relented on the third time and &quot;sat on his tail.&quot; Her refusal to marry him is perhaps indicative of her decision whether or not to maintain a life style of lust, or to pursue a spiritual calling and redeem herself. So, the first time around she does indeed give in to her passions. However, the second time around is more about what she chooses to do after that original mistake. Does she continue to continue to be the town harlot?   Or does she abandon that aspect of herself (the straw imitation) and pursue a life of spiritual dedication.Though she does not end up pregnant in the story, it is at least implied. And suffice it to say, it seems irrelevant if she was corrupted outside of wedlock. A woman who was not a virgin prior to marriage was not in high demand, regardless of whether she had given birth to a bastard. ;One of the things I think we have to remember is to interpret these stories within the correct cultural context. Some interpretations have suggested explanations which have a feminist leaning to them, e.g. the maiden being a strong woman because she leaves him. However, these tales were selected and edited by the Grimm brothers because they were felt to exemplify traditional German virtues and character, such as simplicity and sexual modesty. This quality was called Volksgeist, or &quot;spirit of the people,&quot; and was the primary purpose of the Grimms&apos; work; at the time these stories were compiled Germany was still a fragmentary group of un-unified states and these stories we thought to be a central tool in developing a national identity. ;</string>

            <string>I am often surprised at how often people of the contemporary era seek to assign racist motives and beliefs to individuals from the past. To do that, you have to be interpreting the work through today&apos;s cultural lens; which means you&apos;re probably not interpreting it correctly. Even if Stoker stated things in ways that are an affront to the politically correct sensibilities of some people today, his writing must be understood in the context of its time; it diminishes our understanding of the work if we do not.;Laura,Are you saying that you&apos;re only viewing Stoker as racist because you know that people of that time were prone to stereotyping? Isn&apos;t that stereotyping as well? What I am saying is that I think discussions of racism are frequently irrelevant. People in contemporary society have just become used to seeing discrimination everywhere and consequently is has become a trite issue. I have not seen any racist statements in my reading of Stoker&apos;s work, though granted, I am only a hundred pages in. Can you give some examples of what you mean?;When we think of superstitions we often think of some idea or notion which is backward and lacking in validity. At best, such practices and beliefs may seem quaint. I think Stoker emphasizes Harker&apos;s Western worldview so that he can later turn it upon its head. When the only things which are able to fend off Dracula are the Old World &quot;superstitions&quot;, such as the crucifix, Harker&apos;s belief system is inverted with that of the peasants; his objective schema is the one which no longer makes sense, while the &quot;superstitions&quot; of the peasants become the only ones with validity. This is a great literary technique, and illustrates the unnatural horror that is Dracula; for Stoker, the Count represents the breakdown of the natural order, and consequently only a methodology which is supernatural can defeat him.;While you make an interesting point, and to some extent it may be true, I don&apos;t think ethnocentricity is what Stoker was trying to ultimately convey. In fact, Dracula was highly civilized, yet the very embodiment of horror. By contrast, there was a certain comfort found in the acts of the common rustic folk. As Stoker states in chapter one (page 8 in my book) &quot;One by one the several passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind,  but each was given with a kindly word, and a blessing...&quot; (emphasis added). So while Hawker finds these customs somewhat idiosyncratic, he non-the-less seems to find them touching.;From a theological perspective I see how Stoker has portrayed Dracula and many of the things associated with him as a corruption and mockery of Christian beliefs. His consumption of blood and rising from the grave are the most obvious parallels, and his inability to cross water can be seen as the converse of Christ&apos;s miracle of walking on water. To expound upon this theme, I think Dracula&apos;s association with the wolf is especially noteworthy, as it positions him as the direct enemy of the Lamb of God, and as the predator of Christ&apos;s flock. His need to return to the earth of his homeland also associates him with the Chthonic pagan deities of old, and thus as antithetical to Christ. ;Throughout this story we see a continual reference to science on the part of Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward. Usually this takes the form of them mentioning their craft and its tools as weapons against the evil of Dracula. But ultimately the only tools which are effective against him are the tried and true ones of faith, e.g. the crucifix, ancient customs, etc. So what are we to make of this? Is Stoker trying to say that science and faith (or the supernatural as represented in the character of Dracula) are at odds with each other? Or is he trying to demonstrate that science can enrich one&apos;s faith (and vice versa), as evidenced by the character of Van Helsing, who though a scientist, uses the weapons of faith to great effect, and uses science to greater understand matters of the supernatural. Indeed, perhaps Van Helsing can be considered a metaphor for the God the Father figure, as well as a scientist; he is depicted as a wise old man, tender, but stern; he has a deep understanding of the workings of nature and of man; and throughout the book he frequently enjoins the other characters to have faith in him, until such a time as he can reveal his true purpose.;I also underlined these sections. The haste that science often rushes to first and final principles with is often counter intuitive; while science emphasizes a meticulous and methodological approach, some of its adherents take those small truths and generalize them into dogma. Van Helsing is cautioning against this mentality. When we think we know the whole truth based upon only pieces of the puzzle, we close our minds to other possibilities that may be equally valid.Van Helsing&apos;s quote on faith is reminiscent of Aquinas; it doesn&apos;t seem he is saying that faith makes us believe untrue things, but rather allows us to believe things which seem to be untrue based upon small pieces of disjointed evidence, yet are true none-the-less. &quot;To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.&quot;   ;Good point. He does say &quot;I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an indulgence.&quot; But he doesn&apos;t elaborate on this and I&apos;m not sure how having an indulgence would explain how he obtained it.;Ok, that&apos;s very helpful; mine doesn&apos;t have that note, and I understood an indulgence to be a dispensation from temporal punishment for a sin. ;It&apos;s funny you should mention Darwin; in a way Dracula can be seen to represent the implications of evolutionary theory. He is predatory and his transformations to and from various animal forms could be symbolic of the &quot;beast within.&quot; Darwinism was a controversial topic then, as now, and the Count was certainly &quot;red in tooth and claw&quot; (a quote from Lord Tennyson which Stoker would have been familiar with); he himself may have been a parody of the possible ramifications of the theory of evolution. ;</string>
            <string>I also found the writing style to be a bit undeveloped and puerile; Shelley creates somewhat of a buildup with Victor beginning to develop his interest in natural philosophy, but then instead of developing that in a organic way, we suddenly are witnessing the creation of the monster. It just seems that his transition from naive student to obsessed scientist is never fleshed out. How did he get from point A to point C?Also, I found it disconcerting that it didn&apos;t occur to Victor that the creature might still be in his apartment until after he had arrived back there with Clerval; this was only the morning after he had created the monster. How does one forget something like that?   Essentially, much of the story seems contrived. ;Actually, that&apos;s more the why, not the how. It&apos;s not narratively robust. That&apos;s like saying &quot;He read Frankenstein and became a great author.&quot; There&apos;s nothing intervening between the two. The how would be more akin to describing his efforts to gather the materials, expounding upon the theory, and describe the process leading up to the main event. ;</string>
            <string>I didn&apos;t really get the impression that Aminadab was a wicked character. I think Hawthorne was juxtaposing his more worldly nature, with the high mindedness of Aylmer. He initially refers to him as &quot;thou man of clay,&quot; which at once associates Aminadab with a golem, an artificial construct made of clay, and also with Adam, the primeval man. Further, this association with the earthly makes it ironic that in some ways Aminadab is wiser than than Aylmer (with his head in the clouds, so to speak), as seen when Aminadab says &quot;If she were my wife, I&apos;d never part with that birthmark.&quot;;In the last several readings, and in science fiction in general, immortality and the preoccupation with youth seems to be a common theme. In Alice we encounter the awkwardness, the bitterness and confusion of growing up; in Dracula we see a corruption of the resurrection story; in Frankenstein a perversion of the natural propagation of life. Most recently, Hawthorne seems to be cautioning us that this pursuit of immortality can derail us from actually living life. In &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment&quot;, the four friends become consumed by the Waters of Life, and &quot;resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida and quaff at morning, noon and night from the Fountain of Youth.&quot; Their desire for eternal youth has become an obsession, for which they are willing to trade the very act of living life, for youth for its own sake. I think Hawthorne is really emphasizing that such lofty goals of science can actually be detrimental to the human experience, unless we question their ultimate motivations; scientific advancement should be in service to the human experience; it is a method to enrich that experience, but not the end in and of itself. ;I also don&apos;t think Hawthorne was saying that immortality is immoral in and of itself; I think he was simply cautioning against becoming so preoccupied with it that we stop experiencing the joy of each moment. It&apos;s kind of like today when someone spends several hours a day in the gym and only eats wheatgrass. Aren&apos;t they diminishing their experience of life a little bit because all of their time is spent in the working out, or when they continually deny themselves other small pleasures of life? I guess a more modern hypothetical question to ask, which still emphasizes Hawthorne&apos;s point, would be &quot;If spending 20 hours a day in the gym would make you immortal, would you do it?&quot;;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m sticking with fantasy books for young adults and children because that&apos;s most of what I read anyway! Trust me, books meant for younger readers are often the most well written.  1.  The Lives of Christopher Chant by Diana Wynne Jones (love this author!)2. The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart. (a very clever book. You&apos;ll enjoy it.)3. The Giver by Lois Lowry (a must read.)4. The Wind on Fire Trilogy by William Nicholson (I don&apos;t think this is very well known, but it&apos;s SO good.)5. The Princess Bride by William Goldman (a classic.)- Honorable Mention: Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It&apos;s so funny!- I&apos;m seconding the recommendation of A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L&apos;Engle. That whole series is amazing. - I also loved the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman as already mentioned. -  Someone briefly mentioned The Chronicles of Narnia. I just reread all those books and I&apos;d recommend just reading The Magician&apos;s Nephew. It&apos;s lesser known but really good storytelling and imagination. You&apos;ll see.;&quot;Hans in Luck&quot; is the story of a boy who worked seven years for a lump of gold, but on the walk home to his mother traded it for a horse, traded the horse for the cow, and kept making trades until he only had a rock that he dropped. When I was reading this tale I thought it must be a story with a strong moral of the dangers of squandering your money.  Yet...the moral never came. The ending is ambiguous, and Hans is still happy. The reader doesn&apos;t know what will happen and can only guess how his mother will react when he gets home.  So then I thought that this must be a story about how you can be happy.  But no reader would want to follow Hans&apos; example! We can see that Hans is so dumb to trade away all his possessions and be happy while he does it. Is the point of the story really that &quot;If you&apos;re really dumb, you can be happy no matter what&quot;? What do you think the &apos;point&apos; of this story is?;I remember that poem! I&apos;m starting to think that that&apos;s all this story is about too, at least on the surface.;This is an interesting interpretation. Now that you mention how the stones weigh him down, it seems that each possession Hans comes by has a drawback   - the horse runs away, the cow doesn&apos;t give milk, etc, etc.  However, there are several things in the story which disagree with your interpretation. First, Hans is very happy from the beginning and doesn&apos;t seem to change as a character. And secondly, Hans WANTED the horse, cow, pig, etc very much. He desired the possessions because he didn&apos;t have them and thought they would make him happy, and once he had them he didn&apos;t want them, which seems to suggest &quot;The grass is greener on the other side.&quot; To go with your interpretation, I guess you could say Hans is gradually losing his desire for any material possessions so in that way he does change. Kind of like a rich person who, after having everything, realizes things can&apos;t bring happiness.I think that relating this story to the creation story is a bit of a stretch, but I&apos;ll agree that 7 is a magical and spiritual number. So Hans is going on a spiritual journey of a kind. Very interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.;When you put it that way, you&apos;re exactly right. It seems happiness depends on your perspective.Maybe this story is about how you can&apos;t judge others based on what you would have done because everyone is different. Grimm definitely seems to be playing with the reader&apos;s expectations and having a bit of a joke because the reader might think &quot;Oh no! Hans has given away 7 years of hard work!&quot; but Hans is happy about all his decisions.;Like so many others, nothing really inspired me...I was drawn to stories from the beginning. I believe children naturally are, and this inclination just has to be nurtured by teachers and parents. I&apos;ve been a preschool teacher, and I love reading to groups of kids, and watching all of them be completely spellbound by the story. They are so into it! They eat it up! They can&apos;t get enough! I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve seen this yourself. People naturally love a good story.The real question should be: what inspired you to keep reading, to be a lifelong reader? For, so many people as they get older just get &apos;too busy&apos; to read and put reading low on their priorities list after work, relationships, tv, money, whatever else it may be. But we all know how important reading actually is.  For me, I&apos;m an introvert and more shy and reserved by nature. So growing up, reading was a way for me to live vicariously through characters. To explore far off lands and have adventures without having to leave the house. My mom encouraged my reading habit and we made regular trips to the library (she loves to read too). I was highly imaginative and reading fostered that creative and curious side of me. That&apos;s why growing up I loved fantasy and still continue to today.  ;I think that you need to approach this course and the stories themselves with an open mind. If you stop after the first story you&apos;ll miss some great ones. I am reading the stories a bit at a time and some are delightful, some are thought-provoking, some are strange, some are bizarre, and all of them have more to them than what&apos;s on the surface. I am finding them fun to read! So I&apos;d urge you to give it another try. When you signed up for this course you did so to learn, as you have stated. But if you give up so quickly, how can you expect to learn? I personally was able to get the stories onto my kindle following the &quot;Send to Kindle&quot; link on this page. So I&apos;d urge you to try again.;I just submitted mine. I liked the small word count. It forced me to be concise and simple with my writing. My essay was originally twice as long and I was able to shorten it. I am relieved that I was able to fit the word count and still make my point.High fives to those that are finished. And good luck if you&apos;re still writing! Don&apos;t worry about it too much.  ;Inspired by some of the discussions in the threads, I&apos;ve been thinking about the themes in the Brothers Grimm and how we relate to them today. There are so many themes in these stories to talk about.Which themes are still alive in our culture today? These still feel relevant and we see them in movies, books, and throughout. They may look a little different now, but we can recognize them in the Brothers Grimm.  For example: The Cinderella motif. A mousy, outsider girl undergoes a transformation and gets the man of her dreams. I think we can all agree that we still love this idea and see it in many romance movies and books (even though we do away with other parts of the story).Which themes, on the other hand, are &quot;dead&quot;? To us they might feel old and antiquated and we may even be angered by them.  For example: The theme of &quot;Staying in your Place&quot;. In many Grimm stories the poor peasant who tries to be more than that is punished. These stories are from a more regimented society. In our democratic world, we prefer &quot;rags to riches&quot; stories instead, when a man who was poor becomes a millionaire. In fact if someone went around going &quot;The poor should stay poor and the rich should stay rich&quot; he&apos;d probably get shot!Okay, your turn!  ;Some very good points! I think that the repetition draws out the story and builds the suspense. If there were no repetition the stories would be shorter and resolved quicker and just wouldn&apos;t be as interesting. The repetition makes you keep reading to see what will happen that third time.  You follow along with the story better, having some idea what will happen next, and having it happen 3 times seems to raise the stakes. Also there&apos;s something very pleasing about the pattern and repetition, like a song that repeats a catchy chorus. I agree that children like repetition and you see it in many children&apos;s books because it works.  ;I agree, it&apos;s really hard to swallow reading it now! Back then it was the norm for women to be treated like property or prizes to be won but I find it pretty terrible. Definitely, women had less rights, less of a say, and were thought of as lesser creatures in that time. Even though they certainly worked hard (spinning, cooking, cleaning, etc) and men were dependent on them!I have been thinking about the fact that all beautiful women in the stories are virtuous and good and the ugly women are evil or petty. So even back then all women were expected to be beautiful, and if they were not they were nothing! I imagine everyone would be nice to beautiful women but scorn ugly women and so their personalities would be influenced by that. So an ugly woman hated by society would turn bitter and jealous inside, and the stereotype would perpetuate.  There are definitely recurring character tropes in the Brothers Grimm. They were probably common characters in society&apos;s imagination. They seem to be shortcuts that made it easy for the Grimm brothers to write the stories. They didn&apos;t have to explain a character&apos;s personality. They just had to say &apos;beautiful princess&apos; or &apos;mean step-mother&apos; or &apos;youngest brother&apos; or &apos;old king&apos; and everyone could imagine what they were talking about so they could get on with the story.;</string>

            <string>Of course I love the genre favorites, i.e. Doctor Who, Firefly, Stargate, etc. I&apos;m also a fan of dark fantasy. I highly recommend Clive Barker;s Imajica and Caitlin R. Kiernan&apos;s The Drowning Girl. As far as children&apos;s stories go, the entire Oz series is awesome. As was Disney&apos;s Return to Oz movie from the 80&apos;s (at least it&apos;s awesome in my memory).Incidentally, I loved Unico: The Last Unicorn! I didn&apos;t think anyone else remembered that movie.  Also, I see a lot of anime on people&apos;s lists. I don&apos;t watch much anime, but I do like Ghost in the Shell: SAC, as well as Eden of the East (both of which were directed by Kenji Kamiyama). I&apos;m also a fan of Cowboy Bebop and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.;</string>
            <string>Pirate Planet is one of my favorites to this day. What do you think of new Who? I heard a lot of older Whovians express frustration with the story arches (and the doctor himself).;&quot;A Grimm future&quot;Well played.;I had the same reaction.   In The Twelve Brothers the parents plan to kill all the sons if a daughter is born. Hansel and Grethel are left in the woods to die.   Seems terribly cruel. Could be that life had little value when these stories were originally told, but probably not.   All the children eventually survive, so the stories may have just been the entertainment of the day.   Like the scary stories that are told around campfires today.;</string>

            <string>I really don&apos;t want to be &apos;that&apos; guy and I do get the hyperbole you were aiming for but, why dude, why? Coming out of a worldwide recession you should realise the effects of inflation on the value of an item. So, subtract 150 years of inflation, the natural tendency for authors to exaggerate it would be a lot if he got $10 a year.But, this is gold we are talking about so the objective value may be far less than the subjective value at that time, which is what I think the authors were trying to illuminate through the story.;I used  this inflation calculator:  http://www.westegg.com/inflation/I&apos;d look for  a similar calculator  for Germany, but it would probably be skewed by the hyperinflation of the 1920s.;As the text says &quot;as big as his head&quot;, I think we should measure this by volume, not mass.   Considering the age in which this was written and the physical changes in stature from then to now in an average germanic young-adult (assuming he began his apprenticeship as early as 10 years old, he would then be 17, at the youngest), I&apos;m guessing his head was roughly oval 6&quot; high, 5&quot; wide and 5&quot; deep.   I&apos;m not going to do the math, but that&apos;s a doggone huge lump of gold and, if solid, would be too heavy to carry by anyone except maybe that strong man from the 6-soldiers story...;Um, &quot;big as his head&quot; was probably an exaggeration.   And more than likely, his boss paid him in pyrite.   ;Greg, I empathize.Anyway, exaggeration or not, I don&apos;t think the size of the lump even matters beyond symbolism and theatricality.Just an idle thought. Was the lump of Gold as big as his head, or the other way around? It&apos;d be hilarious if this was a snide comment nodding towards the size of his head...;Alright, even if we&apos;re using f=ma here, wouldn&apos;t there be a difference in how much impact a frog can withstand, compared to a fairytale prince (who we all know are so obviously superior to us other humanoids, let alone a frog)?A larger frog can leap 7-10 meters without getting hurt, but that&apos;s because its hind legs are powerful; it wouldn&apos;t withstand a fall of that distance if it didn&apos;t land on its legs. A regular humanoid, on the other hand, would survive that much of a fall (albeit a few broken bones).As for the 150 fold increase, I&apos;m still not convinced we&apos;re using the right equation. Neither do we know the weight of the frog or the prince.Impact (which would give us the possibility of a splat) would be measured by the deceleration caused by hitting the wall. Now that would lead us to the same result, but we take one more factor into consideration - gravity. Because the prince would be heavier than the frog, the secondary vector (that of gravity) would also increase, because of which the prince would hit the wall at an angle (if he even makes it that far - the increase in mXg should cause him to hit the floor rather than continue in the original trajectory) while the frog would hit it dead on.But, like I said, we don&apos;t know the distance, the size of the frog, or the muscle density of the princess&apos; throwing arm (which I wager wouldn&apos;t be too much).;</string>
            <string>Interesting. Though I would like to point again towards the effects of gravity on the entire equation. The throw wouldn&apos;t be linear by any means. The effect of gravity would slow down the changed object path considerably.And even if we&apos;re taking it as linear, a human being hit by a wall at 25-30 mph... would be equivalent to a 10-12 meter fall (whilst not landing on the legs, but the back/chest whatever, onto a solid wall.)So no splat, but plenty of broken ribs and a visit to the blacksmith. I have traceur friends who&apos;ve had worse falls and are still alive. Either way, absolutely in no shape to get married.... Either that, or one can imagine him changing just before impact, doing an impressive wall-flip off the wall and landing safely on his feet with a bunch of flowers in his hand. Not very scientific, but definitely more fairy tale-ish.;pre-nup?;Stories like these are edited by the teller to be appropriate to the audience, and these stories have been edited so many times that they may be pretty far from the oral tradition when we see them printed, even in an edition that&apos;s from the 19th century. The version of Rapunzel in the Lucy Crane collection includes a little detail  (well, two details, really) that my old Andrew Lang collections (Red and Blue Books of Fairy Tales) and  Disney overlooked.   ;The rabbit had no power over the maiden until she &quot;sat on his tail.&quot; Then, suddenly, he could order her around and she was compelled to do whatever he asked. They were expected to be married, and she could not escape without doing something as drastic as faking her own death.   So yeah, it seems like a cautionary tale about premarital sex, wrapped in a metaphor to obscure the actual meaning from young children.Six Soldiers of Fortune, on the other hand, is about how awesome it would be to form a group of supervillains to plunder all wealth from the kingdom and live happily ever after in the days before Superman and Batman.   :D;In the world of &quot;The Goose Girl,&quot; drops of blood on a napkin mean that a girl is safe.   Hmmm...;The clerk and the parson just serve to make things more serious, as demonstrated below:Kids: Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!Clerk: Sorry, kids, but the magistrate has determined that Trix are for rabbits.Kids: Awww!;Elmer Fudd still gets fooled by Bugs Bunny in a dress and bonnet, even today.I&apos;m just wondering why there&apos;s not a better description of the maiden&apos;s naked walk of shame back home after she dressed the straw girl in all of her clothes.   ;Maybe!   Have you also just always assumed that Elmer had to be some kind of elf because he&apos;s only half the size of an average rabbit?;The Grimm tales take place in a world where anything can happen to anyone at any time for any reason. In order to really make an event stand out, it has to happen at least three times. The first time is a random occurrence. The second time establishes a pattern. And the third time breaks that pattern.;Lucky Hans makes a series of logical trades, each of which increase his utility and happiness based on the information available to him at the time. What&apos;s not to be happy about?;However bad Hans is at managing his money and possessions, and no matter how foolish he seems when interacting with other people, he is still depicted as well liked and competent enough at his job to earn quite a substantial salary. I&apos;ve known absolutely brilliant people--software engineers, university professors, and the like--who made horrible investments that no reasonable person would make. Hans is true to life.;Does it have to have a moral?   If you go to a place called &quot;Nut Mountain,&quot; you&apos;d think there would be so many nuts lying around that you wouldn&apos;t have to be greedy about the first one you happen to find.;There&apos;s nothing sexually symbolic about the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, except for how they both entered a hole located under a bush. And all that key-and-lock imagery. And the sign that says, &quot;Eat me!&quot; And how she ends up swimming in an ocean of bodily fluids. And the worry about whether the rabbit has adequately covered his hands with protective gloves. But aside from all that, nothing sexually symbolic at all.;Doctor #7 Sylvester McCoy&apos;s companion, Ace, would be the most like Alice. She called him Professor, like Dodson actually was a professor, and The Curse of Fenric is an adventure based on a game of chess, much like Through the Looking Glass.   It&apos;s not just that Sylvester McCoy plays chess--Matt Smith plays chess against the Cybermen too--but Ace is a pawn in the game and figures out a strategy for winning.  ;Unlike Eve, the fisherman&apos;s wife doesn&apos;t even have a snake to blame--the idea and the greed are all hers. Meanwhile, the fisherman&apos;s fault is not saying, &quot;My wife is unreasonable and will never be happy, so... could you get me a different wife instead?&quot;   :D;When I was in first grade, The Fisherman and His Wife was a story the school librarian read to our class during our weekly visit to the library. When she got to the part where the wife wanted to be pope, I raised my hand to ask about what a pope was, because I&apos;d never encountered that word before. She replied that as a public school librarian, she was not allowed to tell us what a pope was, and I knew what it meant when an adult couldn&apos;t talk about something to children. &quot;Oh! It has to do with sex! She wants to be a pope because a pope is a person who gets to have lots and lots of sex!&quot;   I was immediately sent out of the room and didn&apos;t get to hear the end of the story, and when I went to look for it afterwards, the book had been removed from the shelf. After all this time, it&apos;s great to finally learn how the story ends!;George Burns and his wife, Grace Allen, had a comedy routine for many years on radio and then early television. I&apos;ve seen clips of Burns and Allen and couldn&apos;t help thinking of them while reading this story. George would tell Grace to, &quot;Say goodnight, Gracie.&quot; and she would say, &quot;Goodnight, Gracie!&quot; just like the way Kate is also extremely literal and prone to forgetting her own identity.   But George and Grace stick together and love each other, just like Fred and Kate, and it&apos;s very sweet. Patronizing, yes, but still very sweet.Kate is among the most fully realized characters in any of these tales. She proves that you don&apos;t need witchcraft or talking animals in your fairy tale when you have such a distinctive and amusing personality!   The fantasy comes from imagining a world in which Kate can be so over the top foolish, and Fred can be so amazingly forgiving of her shortcomings.;I wanted more from these tales. I wanted to get to know the characters better, to understand their motivations, and to get a better sense of who they are and how they relate to their world. With a few notable exceptions like Hans in Luck and the princess in The Frog Prince, the characters are two dimensional and might as well be sleepwalking through their stories.   To go directly from Grimmland to Wonderland really makes me appreciate Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice for all her humor, quirks, and charm.;  Alice Liddell was born on May 4th, 1852. The first book takes place on her seventh birthday, in 1859. The second book takes place six months later.;The professor was applying a Freudian critique to the tale, which is valid, although certainly not the only way to read things. I don&apos;t know if I buy it entirely either, but having an alternate perspective does make the story more interesting to think about.;Every story has an implicit or explicit backstory. If you accept that these particular stories have common and predictable attributes, sequences, and themes, it&apos;s not much of a stretch to extrapolate backward to uncover likely elements that are most consistent with the format and genre.;There are many theories of literary analysis that will tend to contradict each other, but that doesn&apos;t mean they don&apos;t have value or should be dismissed entirely. Professor Rabkin seems to favor Freudian theory, Christian iconography (which he even applies to a pre-Christian Aesop story), some aspects of feminist theory, and an overall historical and social context, but these stories could also be seen through so many other lenses as well. As a writer, my main goal in this course is to deconstruct the material in a way that will help me become a better writer. The takeaway for me is these tales contain something primal and powerful that I would love to understand in a practical way, so that I might add to my writing toolkit. Symbolism of the natural world, analogies to developmental psychology, religious allegory, and Propp&apos;s morphology theory... I&apos;m still trying to process it all, and that&apos;s just Week One!  But there&apos;s also a cautionary tale that the power in these stories can be used for evil in the wrong hands. The Grimms intended their tales as nationalist propaganda. As a side effect, they indoctrinated children with antisemitism and taught that it was perfectly fine to throw people you don&apos;t like into ovens. A few generations later, just look where that got us.;Yup. Maybe the Grimm brothers didn&apos;t intend for anything evil to happen, but that doesn&apos;t make them any less negligent for deliberately combining nationalism, antisemitism, and a desensitized attitude toward murder in tales meant for impressionable minds.I said that I don&apos;t buy into the Freudian analysis of the story, but many people do so I&apos;m a least going to give it some thought. Of coruse I&apos;d like to hear more about your opposing viewpoint as well.;Try to find a copy of the Annotated Alice in Wonderland. Lots of information about where Carroll got his names.;</string>
            <string>So Charles Dodson was the Jane Goodall of girls?;As Professor Rabkin explained in the video lectures, the Grimm brothers&apos; scholarship was politically motivated. They were aligned with a group who sought to unite the Germanic tribes by creating dubious racial connections to the light-skinned Aryan conquerors of antiquity. The sampling of stories that Lucy Crane translated into English did not include the most egregiously antisemitic stories in the original collection, such as the one that the professor described, &quot;The Jew in the Thornbush,&quot; where antisemitic elements were added by the Grimms to an older story that did not originally have them.   Combined with the power of the fairy tale format, this material was most definitely intended to be propaganda by 19th Century German nationalists, and was then used for more nefarious propaganda purposes in the 20th Century. They had a great impact on impressionable minds--and yes, children are not the only ones who have impressionable minds.  ;The professor pointed  out  the blatant, intentional  antisemitism in a  Grimms&apos; story that is actually called &quot;The Jew in the  Thornbush.&quot;  He pointed us  to an earlier  Italian version of that story that didn&apos;t have antisemitism in it, and which would have been sitting on the shelf in the Grimms&apos; university library.  He  showed us how the Grimms had a habit of adapting tales from  other sources and claiming them as part of the Germanic folk canon. He  showed us  exactly what elements the Grimms added to the tales,  and the  demonstrated political agenda they were hoping to advance as a result.  He showed us how  the Grimm  stories fail to follow Vladimir Propp&apos;s rules that successfully identify genuine works for folk literature from every other culture that&apos;s ever existed on Planet Earth. And after all that,  you think Professor Rabkin  is just seeing what  he wants  and that  he&apos;s the one who&apos;s prejudiced?;The old woman in Hansel and Gretel was shoved into an oven because she wanted to eat the children. This is awfully close to the &quot;blood libel&quot; that antisemites have historically used to claim that Jews killed Christian children and baked their blood into Passover matzohs. In Nazi Germany, these slanders were used to justify putting real people into real ovens in real life. The concentration camp crematoria burned  up millions of men, women, and children.   I&apos;m not saying the Grimm brothers foresaw this or would have wanted it to happen, but their stories and the themes contained in them were used to justify pure evil.This is all completely separate from the anti-feminist themes you keep alluding to. Your criticism may be valid, but  that doesn&apos;t give you license to denigrate the opinions of others or to ignore facts that you find inconvenient.;First, read the Wikipedia entry on the  V  lkisch movement that &quot;combined sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore, local history and a &apos;back-to-the-land&apos; anti-urban populism&quot; in the 19th Century onward, and how it influenced Nazi ideology and political practices. (Hint: &quot;Adolf Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: &apos;the basic ideas of the National-Socialist movement are populist (v  lkisch) and the populist (v  lkisch) ideas are National-Socialist.&apos;)Next, read the Wikipedia entry on the 1935 Nuremberg Laws that the Nazis put in place to strip Jews of their civil rights, and their background in  v  lkisch prejudice.   You may then go on to read up on whatever history of the Holocaust you prefer.Then tell me again about how this alleged campaign to harass useless old women was the real horror of Nazi Germany.  ;The Holocaust Museum is a very special and important place. You should go there. If you do,  please ask the staff whether they will endorse your above-stated theory that &quot;people  fixate on a period in history that everyone can agree is evil and so don&apos;t have to look at the world around them.&quot; Be sure to quote your words verbatim, as I have done. If they do agree that their website supports your statements, then who am I to argue?;Agreed.;I&apos;m hoping to find some fellow authors to connect and brainstorm with on how we might apply the lessons of this course to our own writing. Please introduce yourself, share your goals for the course, and some of your thoughts on the material we&apos;ve seen so far.My name is Greg R. Fishbone, and I write science fiction and fantasy novels for young readers. My latest is the Galaxy Games series for ages 9-12, published by the Tu Books imprint at Lee &amp; Low Books. Their focus is on multicultural science fiction and fantasy for midgrade and young adult readers, filling a much-needed gap in the industry. I am also a longtime member and assistant regional advisor for the Society of Children&apos;s Book Writers and Illustrators, an organization I highly recommend to anyone interested in writing for children.I am interested in this course because I learned writing in an academic setting from elementary school through college but had to pick up genre theory from my own pleasure reading outside of class. Fantasy and science fiction stories have been my favorites for as long as I can remember, but I&apos;ve never had the opportunity to dissect them as an academic exercise in order to figure out how the genre developed and what makes it so appealing.What I got out of the Grimm section: Roughly two thirds of the tales in the Crane collection were entirely new to me. Of the other third, I&apos;d only encountered a handful in their &quot;original&quot; form, and the rest in adaptations. Most of these tales, as they are written, would not be published today without some major revision and retelling, but we can recognize a power that comes from morphology and symbolism. How can we use that in our writing? Princess Leia was clearly a damsel in distress, and It now makes sense that Gene Roddenberry put characters in red shirts if they were about to die a horrible death, so symbolism is alive and well in science fiction. Is anyone up for digging deeper into Vladimir Propp&apos;s theories?Looking forward to Lewis Carrol: The start of children&apos;s literature as its own thing? This ought to be good!Okay, your turn!;This is what I found online, which includes a map of Propp onto Campbell&apos;s heroic cycle, which I was familiar with, and Van Gennep&apos;s initiation rituals, which I was not:  http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/Hero.htmPropp&apos;s 31 Functions of the Folktale:   Preparatory Section:l. One of the members of a family absents himself from home.  2. An interdiction (ban) is addressed to the hero.  3. The interdiction is violated. (The villain usually enters the story here.)  4. The villain makes an attempt at reconnaissance.  5. The villain receives information about his victim.   (The villain gets an answer.)  6. The villain attempts to deceive his victim by using persuasion, magic, or deception.  7. The victim submits to deception and thereby unwittingly helps his enemy. (Hero sleeps.)Villainy / Lack (Plot set in motion):8. The villain causes harm or injury to a member of a family.  8a. One member of a family either lacks something or desires to have something.  9.

The hero is transferred, delivered, or led to the whereabouts of an object of search.Path A: Struggle and Victory over Villain; End of Lack and Return:16. The hero and villain join in direct combat.  17. The hero is branded.  18. The villain is defeated.  19. The initial misfortune or lack is liquidated.  20. The hero returns.  21. The hero is pursued.  22. The hero is rescued from pursuit.Path B: Unrecognized Arrival, Task, Recognition, Punishment, Wedding:23. The hero, unrecognized, arrived home or in another country.  24. A false hero presents unfounded claims.  25. A difficult task is proposed to the hero.   (Trial by drink, fire, riddle, test of strength.)  26. The task is resolved or accomplished.  27. The hero is recognized, often by a mark or an object.  28. The false hero or villain is exposed and / or punished.  29. The hero is given a new appearance.  30. The villain is pursued.  31. The hero is married and ascends the throne.Dramatis personae: (seven roles which any character may assume in the story)1. the  Villain, who struggles with the hero;  2. the  Donor, who prepares and/or provides hero with magical agent;  3. the  Helper, who assists, rescues, solves and/or transfigures the hero;  4. the  Princess, a sought-for person (and/or her father) who exists as goal and often recognizes and marries hero and/or punishes villain;  5. the  Dispatcher, who sends the hero off;  6. the  Hero, who departs on a search (seeker-hero), reacts to the donor and weds at end;  7. the  False Hero, who claims to be the hero, often seeking and reacting like a real hero.;This looks awesome. I will have to get a copy. Thanks!;Thanks, William. What are you writing?;Has anyone ever considered writing a retold fairy tale? I&apos;ve always thought Sleeping Beauty had the most potential for this, because there&apos;s a natural hundred year gap in the story. She goes to sleep in an atavistic &quot;once upon a time&quot; era, but there&apos;s no reason why she couldn&apos;t wake up in modern times. Or futuristic times. Or why she couldn&apos;t be a samurai warrior instead of a princess. Or--shoot, did I just describe the plot to Samurai Jack?   :D;What did everyone take away, from a writer&apos;s perspective, from Lewis Carroll&apos;s books? I found it interesting that they were not written for a broad audience but for one particular reader--in a one-of-a-kind handwritten manuscript!   It reminded me of the popular public speaking advice of ignoring the auditorium full of people and focusing on a single face in the crowd. Would it help any of us to keep one reader in mind when writing and come up with the most entertaining story just for them?;Another question, from listening to Professor Rabkin compare Alice&apos;s fall down the rabbit hole to Adam and Eve&apos;s &quot;Fall&quot; from the Garden of Eden...Have any of you intentionally inserted naturalistic symbols, Christian allegory, or allusions to Greek mythology into your stories as a subtle subtext that a casual reader would not necessarily notice? I haven&apos;t done so, at least consciously, and yet readers looking for symbolism always seem to find it.   Some of it may come from the subconscious of the reader, and some may come from the subconscious of the author, but is there any advantage gained in trying to plant things intentionally that only a literature professor would find?I&apos;m looking forward to Professor Rabkin&apos;s analysis of John Carter of Mars because, obviously, any character whose initials are J.C. is intended to be a Jesus figure.   ;Retold myths are different from what I was talking about, but I am interested in hearing how you approached yours. Would a reader need to be familiar with the original to get the most out of it? Did you provide an explicit reference to the old story, or did you just use the themes and elements in a new setting?;It sounds like a very effective and powerful story. So if I&apos;m understanding correctly, the links to the original myth were implicit but you were able to hook your editor with them, and thinking about the myth made it easier to write the story?;If I were making a movie, there would be pressure to have to be 100 minutes long, more or less, so it could be shown on TV in two hours (with commercial breaks). If I&apos;m writing a book, it can be exactly as long as it needs to be in order to tell the story.If I were making a movie, I&apos;d need to first raise tens of millions of dollars, or a hundred million plus if I want to make a blockbuster. Even indie films cost more money than you would think. That means getting a production company, studio, or investors involved, and they will want some control over how the film is made. If I&apos;m writing a book, it&apos;s just me, my laptop, and all the coffee I can drink.If I were making a movie, I&apos;d need to scout out locations for filming or build the location in a studio or with computer graphics. The perfect location might be too far away, or unavailable, or the weather might not cooperate during the filming, so I might have to settle for something else.   If I&apos;m writing a book, I can put the scenes anywhere I want and also control the weather.If I write a book that represents my singular vision and somebody wants to turn it into a movie, they will run into all the format, budget, and control issues I managed to avoid. I&apos;d wish them the best of luck, though.;Comics are a medium like novels, movies, or video games. You certainly wouldn&apos;t say that &quot;all movies are fantasy&quot; or &quot;all novels are science fiction.&quot; Like those other media, comics can tell any kind of story--romance, western, mystery, historical fiction, biography, memoir--but through a quirk of the industry, comic books in the United States from the 1950s onward have been focused (with some exceptions) on superheroes, which have fantasy and science fiction tropes. Even Archie and his Riverdale friends live in a world that co-exists with The Punisher.If you are interested in the theory of comics as a medium, I&apos;d strongly recommend Scott McCloud&apos;s Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.  ;People don&apos;t write letters as much as they used to, so today we have books written in the form of email (Snail Mail No More by Paula Danziger and Ann Martin) and texts (ttyl by Lauren Myracle). Also, diary format will never go out of style as long as Jeff Kiney keeps making Wimpy Kid books. I wrote a book in the form of letters (The Penguins of Doom by Greg R. Fishbone) but haven&apos;t come across many others that aren&apos;t meant to be historical.I can&apos;t say why Stoker or Shelley wrote their books in this format, but I used it because it was the best way to tell the story I wanted to tell. I tried writing in a traditional format a number of ways but it just wasn&apos;t working. Then it struck me that if my characters were writing letters, they could be coy and deceptive in a way that first-person narrative seldom is. People write letters to convey information, but also because they want something from the recipient. They might want different things from different people at different times, so the same person&apos;s writing style will vary according to their goals at the moment. It could be an update on what&apos;s been going on lately, a call for help, an excuse for missing a math assignment, a request for money, or anything else.Today, you&apos;d have to ask what kind of person would take the time to write out a book&apos;s worth of letters. I came up with a character who likes to make excuses, and it was very convenient for her to say she didn&apos;t have time to do something because she&apos;d been too busy writing letters. Back in the 1800s this wouldn&apos;t have been a problem, because all educated folks would have been communicating by letter or not at all. Unless maybe there were books published in the form of telegrams.;Don&apos;t know why that posted as anonymous...;I haven&apos;t gotten there yet, but in chapters I&apos;ve seen it says Seward is recording his thoughts by phonograph.

I read Dracula in high school, but it doesn&apos;t even seem like the same book. Why didn&apos;t I notice that Dracula is brilliant, and that Bram Stoker is a total genius? I certainly would have read more horror if I had.;Professor Rabkin missed an opportunity in his lecture on children&apos;s literature. In discussing a classic work with hidden depths and meaning, he could have chosen to clear up the common misconception that books for young readers are insubstantial and in some way inferior to more adult works. Instead, Rabkin doubled down on the myth by implying that the meaningful elements in the Alice books were only meant for adult readers. According to Rabkin, not even Lewis Carroll, who loved and respected children, would have wasted his best material on them.Because this one great work of children&apos;s literature happens to be written in an episodic format, Rabkin informs us that episodic fiction is a common feature of children&apos;s literature. He calls these books &quot;pearl necklaces&quot; because the beginning and ending are set off by a series of simplistic plot encounters that can be added, removed, or rearranged at will and without consequence, like pearls on a strand. This describes the works of Lewis Carroll, but I&apos;m struggling to come up with another comparable example in children&apos;s or adult fiction in the modern era, with the possible exception of certain anthologies. The children&apos;s authors I know craft their narrative structures with as much care as any adult fiction author.  Maybe the plots in children&apos;s literature are more straightforward than the labyrinthine reversals of a Tom Clancy novel, but they are solid structures and less likely to contain plot holes. Maybe the vocabulary and sentence structure are simpler than in an Umberto Eco novel, but  the meaning is clear and less likely to be misinterpreted.  Happy endings are not required in children&apos;s literature. What&apos;s more common is a hopeful ending, where things aren&apos;t entirely wrapped up but there&apos;s still hope, or a cliffhanger ending in a series book.  And I&apos;m sure fans of Nancy Drew and Encyclopedia Brown would be surprised to hear that tales of the great detective are &quot;much more adult&quot; than stories meant for children.I just spent the last six months revising a middle grade manuscript to ensure that not a single scene could be removed without damaging the plot, or added without wrecking the pacing, or swapped with another scene without losing the narrative thread or character development. There&apos;s nothing wrong with the episodic style that Lewis Carroll used to such great effect, but  I do not write pearl necklaces! And I probably wouldn&apos;t be able to, even if I wanted.In my experience, books for adults are the ones more likely to contain a string of episodic pearls that have nothing to do with the plot or themes of a story. Popular thrillers contain hundreds of pages of bloat, on the theory that adults have longer attention spans and don&apos;t mind wading through unnecessary scenes to get to the heart of a story. Young readers won&apos;t put up with that. If they&apos;re not hooked in the first chapter, and if their attention isn&apos;t held all the way to the end, they&apos;ll toss the book and grab another. It&apos;s more difficult to write for children than it is to write for adults, but rewarding for anyone up to the challenge.;Encyclopedia Brown was what I had in mind as a character anthology--short stories about a single character collected into one volume. However, even an Encyclopedia Brown short story is arranged in a structure. Every scene between the beginning (a mystery presents itself) and the end (Encyclopedia solves the case) is necessary to provide the information and clues necessary to solve the case. There&apos;s never a scene where Encyclopedia Brown talks to a bunch of flowers or has a tea party, just because a bunch of flowers or a tea party happens to appear in his path, without advancing the plot. There are no pearls in Encyclopedia Brown--nothing can be removed, added, duplicated three times, or moved to another place in the story.;</string>
            <string>A modern version of Alice is the Gregor the Overlander series by Suzanne Collins (of Hunger Games fame). A boy falls through a hole in his grimy urban laundry room and ends up in a world populated by talking rats, bats, and cockroaches.;That&apos;s been my experience as well. Symbols are the language of the subconscious, so they will get into our work whether we want them or not. But if we happen to recognize them, we can use them.;I&apos;m definitely seeing Stoker&apos;s vampires as deliberately anti-Christian monsters, intended as a direct corruption of the Christian concept of eternal life. And if I&apos;m seeing that as a non-Christian, it has to be true. When I was a kid, convinced that vampires were hiding under my bed or in my closet, I kept a Star of David on my night table to ward them off. I figured that had to be just as good as a cross. But I see no evidence that would work against Stoker&apos;s vampires.;I thought it represented the ultimate corruption of Lucy&apos;s innocence, by turning her into a monster capable of killing children. The fact that she doesn&apos;t succeed in killing them makes it possible to save her soul.;And did anyone else find it weird that the child was referred to as &quot;it&quot; when Van Helsing uses &quot;him&quot; to refer to just about every inanimate object he comes across?   I know that&apos;s the way German nouns are classified, and kinder is gender neutral, but he seems proficient in English aside from verb forms and noun genders.;Even the runaway wolf from the zoo was depicted with more personality details than that child victim of Lucy&apos;s--and an actual name!;Some authors put a lot of thought into character names and some just go with what sounds good. In Dracula, Lucy clearly meant to be a fallen angel like Lucifer, and Dracula is clearly meant to be a dragon or devil figure, so that&apos;s evidence that Stoker falls into that category of author who care more deeply about the meaning of character names. I&apos;d buy the professor&apos;s argument on Mina&apos;s name, in this case.  The real question for me was why have a Johnathan (Harker) and a John (Sewer) so prominent in the same book?   I know John was a popular name back then, but you usually don&apos;t give two main characters the same first name unless you&apos;re deliberately inviting confusion between them.;</string>
            <string>Are you writing from within the Haitian culture? I can imagine that would make for a refreshing change of pace from mass market zombie stories, especially if it were done with a sense of authenticity.;So, what have we all learned from Dracula that can apply specifically to our own writing?For me, I was fascinated by Stoker&apos;s use of the epistolary format. I noted that the documents were not arranged strictly in chronological order but the few exceptions served to improve narrative flow without being too jarring. I liked that notes were composed in different media--handwriting, shorthand, typewriter, phonograph, newsprint, and telegram--with different stylistic attributes for each. There is a definite shift in Dr. Seward&apos;s voice, for example, when his diary shifts from phonograph to handwriting on the journey to Transylvania. I liked the use of accented English to denote class and national origin. Van Helsing&apos;s accent not only requires a fluency in German, but a familiarity with the grammar errors made by German speakers who are learning English. I liked Stoker&apos;s awareness that these documents are being produced in real time. Often, a character is interrupted in the middle and picks up a diary entry with a different line of thought. Jonathan Harker, writing on the boat at night, has to mention that he is using the furnace of the steam engine as his light. Letters are written with different purposes and different audiences in mind. And somehow, it all works brilliantly.I am overwhelmed by the precision and planning that went into this book, and that&apos;s just the format.   The content is another matter altogether.;It could be an ebook that gets continually interrupted by pop-up windows!   :D;Narration can be first person, second person, or third person. First and third person are by far the most common.Third person narration tells the story of somebody other than the narrator or reader. &quot;Dracula woke up one evening and decided to go for a walk...&quot; The narrative uses he or she for all the characters and puts us at a distance from them.First person narration is about the narrator. &quot;I found myself in the woods after dark. I wondered whether I might run into Dracula. I started to walk a little faster...&quot;  Second person narration is about the reader. That&apos;s rare, but you&apos;ll find it in those choose your own adventure books: &quot;You are running through the woods at night. You see movement in the bushes. Suddenly, you are attacked by Dracula! If you try to run away, turn to page 36. If you invite him to bite your neck, turn to page 40.&quot; Dr. Seuss wrote a book in second person: Oh, the Places You&apos;ll Go!  You&apos;ll want to read it because it&apos;s about you!It can get complicated when a first person narrator slips into third person narration to tell us about other people, or when a first-person letter has a second-person section about the recipient of the letter. &quot;I thought a little more about Dracula. He likes to spread blood on his toast. You&apos;ll remember that from the time he came into the diner where you waitress.&quot;;Over the course of three essays so far, there were two essays in which I labored to share the insights most valuable to me. These were on the structure, style, and technique of the works in question, and each earned a score of 4. On the Alice books, I didn&apos;t have as much time to commit, so I dashed something off about metaphor and some examples on the theme of maturity--off the cuff stuff I could have written without rereading the books, just based on what I remembered of them from when I was ten. This essay got a score of 5.5.   My ten-year-old self thanks you for your generosity.It&apos;s entirely luck of the draw who reads each essay. Feedback I&apos;ve received so far has ranged from puzzling to insightful, as has the quality of essays I&apos;ve been assigned to score myself. I&apos;m convinced that any essay score is really a range of plus or minus one.   The same essay could earn a 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5 depending on random chance.  I&apos;m using the essays to synthesize my own thoughts in a way that&apos;s helpful to me, so the score is secondary to having a way to process my learning.   It would just be nice to have a little more consistency.;From this point on, anyone who manages to work Farscape into an essay will get a 6 from me.   :D;Part of this course seems to require additional layers and levels that might not be apparent on a casual reading. When I read this book years ago, I didn&apos;t see all the religion and sexuality either, but now both seem very deliberate.;Maybe Victor didn&apos;t exist and Walton made the whole story up out of boredom, or because he went crazy out on the ice. Maybe Walton never went on an expedition to the North Pole at all, but found a tropical hideaway where he made up a story to impress his sister back home.   Or maybe he never had a sister in the first place!;</string>
            <string>The real answer is that we&apos;ve become used to a twist ending at the end of every book we read.   As we approach the end, our mind starts working in the background, constructing all sorts of possible twists. What if the hero is really the villain? What if the monster doesn&apos;t exist? What if Walton never went to sea at all? If there&apos;s any ambiguity in the real ending, we&apos;ll insert our theory into it. If it doesn&apos;t fit naturally, we&apos;ll use a sledgehammer.;It&apos;s good practice in making every word count, and it makes peer review easier to have five 320-word essays than any number of ten page essays.;</string>

I&apos;d been giving 3&apos;s and 4&apos;s to essays that didn&apos;t really deserve them because otherwise all I&apos;d be handing out would be 2&apos;s and 3&apos;s, but this week&apos;s 4&apos;s and 5&apos;s were truly earned and I also gave my very first 6 to an outstanding essay that expanded my understanding.   The level of writing has gone up, and hopefully on the other end we&apos;ll see the quality of grading go up as well, as the remaining students are the ones who are most serious about the coursework and course content.  ;More cowbell!;Very nice!  An interesting essay on this phenomenon from a writing perspective:http://new.websnark.com/post/53528789537/on-writing-and-refrigerators;My understanding of the trope is that a (usually female) character is brutally killed so that the (usually male) hero of the piece can make a gruesome discovery that fuels angst and character development.   I don&apos;t know that the three works you cite really fit the mold. In     The Birthmark,    the wife is killed during an elective procedure and the character development we see is what cause both the wife and her husband to accept the risk of death that they knew in advance might result.    Rappaccini   s Daughter    follows the same format--the woman  chooses to drink a potion that might either represent either death or freedom, or where she believes that death might be a better fate than what her father has in mind for her. In  Dr. Heidegger   s Experiment,    there is no in-scene death and therefore also no discovery of a body.;I think Hawthorne is definitely picking women as his victims to provoke a stronger reaction both from the readers and from the male protagonists. Poe, however, is killing off, dismembering, and walling up men and women, old and young, human and feline, in an equal opportunity way. In fact, a very effective stage production I once saw of &quot;The Tell Tale Heart&quot; had a woman as the killer and stayed true to the text, since I don&apos;t think the first person narrator is ever identified by gender.;The common assumption that a character is male when their gender is not actually identified either way is called &quot;male default.&quot;   It&apos;s not discrimination but a deeply ingrained aspect of our culture, along with a corresponding &quot;white default&quot; that assumes that all characters are white unless they are stated to be otherwise.;Rock on!;My first Doctor was Tom Baker, and my first serial was The Deadly Assassin--which gave me a very warped idea of what the show was about. It&apos;s probably the only sequence in the original series where the Doctor has an adventure without any companions. Technically I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a single human character in the entire story--they&apos;re all Gallifreyan. So I thought Doctor Who was about this alien detective who travels around in a blue box, all by himself, solving crimes and foiling assassination plots.;There is a Sherlock/Doctor Who crossover, sort of, also from the Tom Baker era: &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang.&quot;  ;Oh, and hey!   H.G. Wells actually appears as a character in &quot;Timelash&quot; from the Colin Baker era, so this conversation is now back on topic!;My thought was that generational power in the story passes from Moreau and Montgomery to the Beast People. Prendick is a bit of a wildcard, associated at first with the generation of Moreau but eventually defining himself as an equal to the Beast People rather than their superior. Fortunately for him, he holds onto his humanity as the Beast People descend back to their animal nature.;Grotesque theology for a grotesque society. Prendick very blatantly tries to set up Moreau as a supernatural figure in order to cement his own power over the beasts, and even gets Montgomery to go along with him for a while. Essentially, &quot;Moreau no longer walks among you, but he&apos;s still watching from on high. And he will reward those who continue to follow his laws.&quot;   Prendick himself is implied to be an atheist.;I found it interesting that Wells doesn&apos;t name the planet that crashes into Neptune, but with a world associated with fire and death, and following the tradition of naming worlds after Roman gods, he probably would have also come up with Pluto.;</string>
            <string>The Grimms seem to use names so twistily, though.   Is Lucky Hans really as unlucky as he seems at first glance?   In the end, he got home to his mother without any other worries, and isn&apos;t that all he really wanted?;I reckon another point to remember is a lot of these stories would have originally  sprung from oral traditions (both due to lack of written copies and illiteracy levels), in which the various little ditties and songs, and the repetition of specific elements were part of that tradition, used for dramatic effect and to emphasise key ideas.   This would also account for the  variations and commonalities alike in the tales.   I wonder how much  is lost when stories are written down, pinned to the page and unable to evolve as they did prior to the introduction of  mass/printing?  My husband reads my son&apos;s stories word for word, whereas I tend to do a bit of impromptu editing if I don&apos;t agree with the sentence structure or word choice; my son, who is 3 1/2, calls me on it now, telling me I&apos;m reading it &quot;wrong&quot;.   I&apos;m not a participant in the story, just a conduit for THE story, as it is, was and shall be time without end....   bit of late-night melodrama anyone?;That is a great idea. I&apos;ve never used wordle for anything that useful before. ;I&apos;m irritated with the course interface--I was unable to locate how to submit the essay until the deadline had passed today. Now I know where it is, but either Coursera or the instructor should consider adding a &quot;submit test essay here&quot; task to the 0.0 segment.;This is a wonderful theme--cloth in various forms runs through many tales. Good use of examples from the stories, but like Martha, I would be wary of your statement that &quot;only&quot; spinsters and tailors (I would include Rumplestiltskin as a spinster, albeit an unnatural one) can change fate. The Six Swans were redeemed from their fate by the sister&apos;s needlework; and it&apos;s a spinster in Sleeping Beauty who is the unwitting vehicle of fate--she is not able to change it. Maybe this is why in the Disney version, the spinster who lets the girl touch the spindle is the disguised evil fairy. Ah ha--a disguise! more cloth!   Good job on surfacing the relationship between cloth and fate. ;Thanks to all who are contributing to this thread! Here&apos;s my essay:                         Nearly half of the tales in Household Stories involve a beautiful character, often a girl or woman, whose beauty is important to the plot. Feminine beauty is used in three main ways: to elevate the woman&apos;s value as a reward; to display her internal goodness; or to contrast with negative personality traits, especially pride.    In stories like the Golden Goose, Queen Bee, Golden Bird, The Gallant Tailor, and Faithful John, a beautiful girl is either the motive for the central male character to go on a quest, or serves as a reward for a man who completes a seemingly impossible task (or both). The phrase    beautiful princess    sums up the importance of the character: she is a prize to be won, like wealth or power.    Beauty in girls of common birth (eg., a miller   s daughter) is often associated with positive character traits (   pleasant,       obedient,       industrious   ), or with an innate nobility. In    Brother and Sister,       The Six Swans,    and    Twelve Brothers,    a sister works diligently on a secret task to release her brother(s) from a spell. When a passing king takes the sister to his kingdom and marries her (presumably because of her beauty), an older woman (stepmother, witch, mother-in-law) accuses the new queen of deception. By completing the magical task, the young queen demonstrates her loyalty and innocence, and saves both her brother(s) and her own life. Her external appearance and character emerge as truly queenly.  The theme of the beautiful character in conflict with ugly, lazy, or evil female characters runs through many tales. When beauty and pride or vanity are combined in one character (evil queen in    Snow White;    proud princess in    King Thrushbeard   ), the tale ends with the punishment of the female character. She is either humiliated and redeemed, as in    The Frog Prince,    or executed by torture, like the evil queen in    Snow White.    In the Grimm&apos;s worldview, beauty should be more than skin deep.      ;Thanks to both Stephanie and Martha for your thoughtful comments on my essay. Martha--I tend to over-write, so the word count was a serious issue for me on this essay. I&apos;ll try to narrow my scope next time. i was looking for a cross-cutting theme that would use examples from many stories--my first draft was about 500 words. Stephanie, thanks for the specific suggestion of using the pretty/evil character as a counter example rather than just using it as a third example. That would have been much stronger.And Paul, thanks for the technical point--i hope to be pasting my next essay into the assignment submission box to test out the system properly!;Maria, i like your comparison of the Rabbit&apos;s Bride to the myth of Persephone. In another thread, the discussion was focused on whether riding the rabbit&apos;s tail was a sexual reference, but no one made the food/death connection, which is clearly central to the story&apos;s deeper meaning. Good job! (On my next essay, I am going to try to emulate your spare introduction. I wasted a lot of words in my first paragraph saying what I was going to say.)Thanks for posting.;Hi, Karen. Is this your essay, or are you trying out a possible theme for feedback? If it&apos;s an essay, one thing to watch is your sentence structure. Your ideas are interesting--I now want to go look up the derivation of the word &quot;Grimoire&quot;--but your writing is plagued with inclomplete sentences, so it is hard to see what your point is. If these are notes for an essay, i see several ideas that could be fleshed out, including the final point about power and anonymity. That&apos;s fascinating, and I&apos;d like to hear more. Too bad it&apos;s time to move on to Alice (with a known author...although he did write under a pseudonym...hmm).Off to my &quot;big dictionary,&quot; as my kids call it, to look up Grimoire!Cheers! Enjoy the course.;Just looked up Grimoire in wikipedia--it&apos;s generally considered to be a book of magic or spells, although common household remedies might be included (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire). The use of &quot;Grimmerie&quot; in Gregory Maguire&apos;s Wicked series is an intentional reference to a book of spells. When I read Wicked, I thought the name of the magic book was actually a sly reference to the brothers Grimm, so this is an interesting thread for me. ;For the Grimm&apos;s tales especially, the concept of author  intent is not as important as it might be for a work like Alice in  Wonderland. The Grimms gathered stories, selected certain versions,  edited them, and may have rewritten some. But the &quot;authors&quot; were others  who lived before the Grimms. Many of the tales are folktales with a long  history of oral transmission, and the Grimms may have seen their role  more as anthropologists (albeit through a nationalistic prism) than  authors. They even included different versions of the same basic story as part of their own study of the stories and the people who told them.For the upcoming novels with a single known author, much can  be gained and understood by understanding something about the author&apos;s  time, background, and his/her intentional motives for composing the work, and the stated meaning if he or she explained that in their lifetime. But I  agree with Stephanie that additional interpretations by others are  interesting and valuable ways of exploring a work&apos;s relevance and  importance, in part because authors are not always aware of all of the  themes and meanings in their own works. I&apos;m fairly certain that James  Joyce would be flabbergasted by the scholarly and popular  interpretations that have been lent to his work. That doesn&apos;t make the  author&apos;s intentional meaning less important, or the reader&apos;s  interpretation less meaningful. I think our challenge in this course is to engage with the professor and our colleagues, understand their comments and viewpoints, and come to our own understanding of the importance or lack of importance of the stories and themes for our lives and in our culture. If someone else&apos;s interpretation doesn&apos;t make any sense to you, fashion your own. Your interpretation may switch on a lightbulb for someone else.   ;</string>

            <string>young Frankenstein is my favorite Mel Brooks movie, although it owes more to the Frankenstein movies of the 30s than to the Mary Shelley novel. the tropes--the blind man who is kind because he cannot see the monster, the innocent child who is not afraid, and the rural, superstitious society that equates monstrous appearance with evil intent--have their roots in the novel, but the story told is quite different. ;</string>
            <string>So the moral of the story now becomes... Do your market research thoroughly before trading.

You like Jaime and Tyrion in the Lannisters.   Everyone likes Danaerys and the (remaining) Starks.   Stannis has the Onion Knight.   In Greyjoy, Viserys and Asha are relateable.   Even the wildlings have some winners. That technique means that every time you&apos;re rooting for one of your favorite characters, you&apos;re probably rooting against another one you love.   It makes the whole experience much more dramatic.   April;</string>
            <string>It can&apos;t. That&apos;s why I&apos;m pretty sure that &quot;riding the rabbit&apos;s tail&quot; is a metaphor for something else that typically leads to the expectation of marriage.;Fishbone.....smh......;</string>
            <string>Surprisingly, this thread hasn&apos;t mentioned being paid in items having to do with head as often as it might&apos;ve....  :);for those who read portuguese or are able to find a translation, look for &quot;Lendas do Sul&quot; (Legends of the South), it is a similar work but done with the stories that came to be by the mixture of spanish, portuguese and native brazilian stories. It&apos;s a small book but being a southern brazilian of german descent myself, there are the stories I grew up listening. It may be my luck, but I had a grandmother who read a lot and used to retell the stories to me, rather than read them. I came to know Siegfried like this: The knight bathed in dragon&apos;s blood. Thanks to her I knew a closer version to the Grimm&apos;s ones before viewing the Disney movies.;that is, Kendal, the whole point of my essay by the way. By 1812 and the romantic era, be it in the Grimm Brothers, be it in Lord Byron, what we see is a reaction to the medieval morality and practice of seeing one&apos;s children as properties. The parent bargains away his child to the witch as a fair trade for some vegetables and the witch then treats her like a treasure, not a person. She, however, refuses to be just a treasure and secretly marries some random prince who happens to be brave enough to challenge that same conception. Note that there is no scene of the prince telling his king father that he met this peasant girl on a tower and will he please may have er for a wife even though she is obviously not noble born?;Sorry, coming of late here, but the Witch in Rapunzel is severe but, in a teutonic way, just. One may argue that the rampions were enchanted to look extra appealing, but that may also be said of a certain fruit of a certain tree on a vary famous garden.  As for the twins, well, they are the prince&apos;s son, obviously, since the narrator recalls Rapunzel as &quot;his wife&quot;. The thing is, sex and marriage are portrayed as intrinsically correlated, many marriages in Grimm&apos;s stories are &quot;celebrated&quot; away from the family. There is a very protestant way of simplifying this: you make love to the one you love and that&apos;s who you marry.   At least in Rapunzel. The Witch is, in some way, the wronged one and in no moment in the story prior to discovering the girl had been comforting a man, was she cruel the the girl (Rapunzel did not want for food nor was abandonedd by her caretaker on the woods to die, nor had her father order the death of her 12 brothers for no reason whatsoever, i can go on almos forever ... ). There is something of an &quot;old bargaining god&quot; in the witch that calls to memory some of the stories in older germanic tales. Making her a Witch and giving the kniving girl a happy ending is a sign of a new morality. Think back to the greek myths and see what happens to a promised maiden who has sex (even though she was raped, something Rapunzel evidently was not): if Rapunzel&apos;s name were Medusa, her fate would have been much much worse and without hope of redemption.;Kendal, the word in the text is  wife, that to me says that Rapunzel&apos;s was not a rape. The idea being that a person is not a thing and, unlike things, even if you try and hide them, they find their way into the world (in her case, through her singing).;The thing about oral sotries is that, they mutate, Katrina. You may think of Rapunzel as an imprisioned child, but you can also see that as a metaphore for a &quot;protected treasure&quot;. One of the older versions of medusa is that her &quot;seduction&quot; was actually a rape, being Medusa outside to gather flowers for the temple. It is a story so resonant in times of &quot;slut walks&quot; that it might result in a thread of itself, though one might argue that the &quot;robber&apos;s bridesmaid&quot; has a closer relation to Medusa&apos;s myth. There is, in both of them, a modern morality where the women are not to be eternally persecuted for not bowing to the strongest force, be it male or supernatural.;NEVER, EVER APOLLOGIZE FOR CORRECTING SOMEONE. This is how we learn.Please, it is a pleasure to learn and it does not shame me at all. I learned to read by reading greek myth and to me it comes almost as the same way the Grimm tales come, clouded in a fog of oral tradition, but that is good, I guess. So, thank you for reminding me of that earlier medusa story. Of course I am not defending that you coup up a child in a tower, that was some of my point, the tale tells of a new way of seeing people, the romantic way, not as properties as women have been during the middle ages. What I was saying is that the Witch isn&apos;t wicked &quot;from her perspective&quot;, the old perspective, the fundamentalist perspective where people and goods are interchangeable. It is no coincidence that Rapunzel and Rampio are similar (in portuguese the plant is called Rapuncio), the whitch see&apos;s both as the same, as things that are desirable but belong to her. As I first stated, shehas more the workings of an old god, as opposed to the christian (protestant) view of tolerance and forgiveness.;Three is the common sense human number for &quot;this is no longer a coincidence&quot;. Peter denies Jesus three times to let the early christian underestand how much he is deserving of his later contrition and forgiveness. It was not a scared man&apos;s response, it was a true denial, and thus his confession of the sin makes the forgiveness that deal greater. In these stories too the three appears as that proof that something is inequivocal.  ;I agree with Sarah here. Repetition comes through as both mnemonic and suspense though, given their intended audience, character&apos;s character also is built on repetitions of their action, and are usually seen as being consistently wicked, consistently good or consistently loyal.;Take the Fisherman&apos;s Wife, repetition here in the calling of the man of the sea is giving you the hopelessness of the husband under a manipulating overachieving wife.  As a side note, it&apos;s the basic archetype used to create Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones.;there is also a correlation of &quot;marrying&quot; and &quot;having sex&quot;, as seen in Rapunzel, the King&apos;s son &quot;visits&quot; Rapunzel over a fortnight and then finds her much later with their two children. Many other marriages in Grimm&apos;s stories happen away from friends anda family.;Thanks for your comments. I do believe the stories are child appropriate, however, especially today. There was an awareness that people would marry in their teen during the 1800s, so you need to prepare children to deal with adult world. Somewhat during the late 1800s and 1900s we started protecting the children more (some may blame queen Victoria and the puritans). However, today, with the access to absurd amounts of misinformation, telling our children that the world is not just roses, that one strong must use his/her strengh to protect the weaker, etc. There is an urgency in bettering our education to toughen our kids. The world is a beautifull place, but beauty is not the same as innocent.;That is why I said in an earlier comment that I find this stories well in need to be told as is to the children. At least you have a parent there guiding them through the morality and wuestions that may arise.  ;One may say that the whole point of all these tales, in regard for children is:The world is a dangerous place, but if you are clever, brave and fight for the right reasons, you will end up being happy in a way or the other.;Adding to that, being happy is not always marrying the prince or princess or being wealthy beyond measure. Look at Clever Greathel, or the Four brothers who rescue the princess but decide neither to marry her ...  ;Re-reading these stories I got the urge to listen to them, the way the Grimm heard them. There is a power to that. I have found they are more interesting when heard.;iTunes U has almost all of the sotries. For free! Very worth the download.;</string>
            <string>Mythology has a way in turning into fairy tales. Who here is familiar with the norse myth of &quot;The great hunt&quot;?  I&apos;ll summon it up:During the longest night of the winter, when the cold winds make it easier for the bad spirits to escape Jotunheim, lord Odin, the Allfather, gathers the bravest of the aesir and the most talented warriors in the halls of Valhalla and rides in his sledge, pulled by the eight legged flying horse Sleipnir to hunt the evils of the world and protect the living of men of Midgard. On   this night the norse children, to honor the Allfather and in fear of the ferocity of the horse, would leave stockings full of hay to appease the hunger of the animals in the hunting party, thus proving to the gods they were good children and be spared a harsh education as a page in Valhalla. As it was the longest and coldest nigh of the year, usually December 21st through 25th, was also the one period of the year where child mortality was in it&apos;s highest, thus providing the not so sutil explanation that &quot;the bad children where taken by Odin to be pages in Asgard&quot;. It is not a very big jump t go from the Allfather taking away the spirits of the bad children during the night to, as the conditions got better and survival rates climbed, an Allfather who would give gifts to the good children spared and then, through christianizations, some kind of saint that rewards the children at Christmas. It is my favorite example of religious synchretism in the whole world. This, and we celebrate Easter with the symbols of the Celtic Goddess Ostara.;</string>
            <string>There are some discussions that the protesters in Brazil are trying to imagine a new country and a new way to govern it.  Being brazilian and in the middle of these discussions myself, I wish to know the opinion of our dear classmates.One of the propositions, the one I support at least, states that there should be a direct, web based democracy, with a small but effective body of government composed mainly of public servants with just a small core of elected officials. Now, how&apos;s that for political sci-fi?;Dear Anonymous, it all started with some protests about the cost of public transport, which is very high againt the income and was getting higher. The thing is that the police took such a harsh response to it that other issues started arising, first of all the right to protest in itself. As many of the protesters were students, the usual media blindfold of &quot;it&apos;s just a bunch of bums with nothing better to do&quot; fell quite fast. A female journalist was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet and a photographer friend of mine was spanked by unidentified cops after one of the protests. Then it all boiled over, the corruption schemes, the enourmous, and sometimes illegal, spenditure with the stadiums for the World Cup 2014, the crisis with the public health care system, and whatever else you can think is wrong with any country. For the first time, since it happened to the middle class, right wing and left wing went into the streets to protest together. There is a brooding sense of revolution in the air.;Transport fees did go down a bit, in Porto Alegre it went even lower than it was last year, the problem is that this was achieved by granting tax isemption to the companies working transport and not by making them open their books and proving the real cost of the service. People are, of course, demanding free transportation now. To put it in perspective, bus fares in Brazil&apos;s biggest cities are just a little lower than the rates in Paris (BRL 3.55, S  o Paulo is now BRL3,00, Porto Alegre BRL 2.80) but our minimum wage is about a fifth fo that in France. A minimum wage worker here receives BRL 678,00, so, if you work in S  o Paulo, and you need 2 buses to go to work and back, as is usually the case there, you spend 40% of your salary going just going to work and you do that in an overcrowded bus sometimes for two and a half hours. Remember, S  o Paulo has about three times te population of NY or, roughly, it&apos;s Belgium.;Right now I am in the countryside, where I live most of my week, but my hometown, orto Alegre is burning. I&apos;ve read reports at facebook that they were dropping tear gas from helicopters, don&apos;t know how much truth there is to that. Also, a group used the protest to raid a shopping mall, but the police seems to keep harrassing the protesters instead.  ;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wESdLZsGxkc;has anyone else find the pun in the names both revealing and fun?

            <string>I was oint to answer this, but preferred to start a new tread.Here is what I had to say:https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=540;I was talking to a psichiatrist who told me that there are studies - I&apos;m being upfront, haven&apos;t read, but she deals with this kind of stuff day in and day out, so I&apos;m giving her credit - that state the kind of abuse and negative response to empathy as the creature recieves from Frankenstein is responsible for an atrophy of the empathic receptors in the brain and will, with time, make the individual unlearn empathy on a neuro-chemical level, thus making said individual imune to empathic data. According to her, the ineer workings of our brain do follow in some way the lamarckian thoery of use and disuse, thus an intelectually challenged individual may become more intelligent and an emotionally slanted individual may become truly emontionless, when both combine - all the brain power (libido for those Freudian amongst us) goes into a focused learning curve with little to no positive contact with a community (Mary Shelley got that right also), the result is a psychopath.  In warning us about her fictious kind of monster, the-better-Shelley (as I like to call her) also ended up warning us about a very common modern-day one.  Other studies have surfaced in these last few years that most psychopaths can focuse their libido and violence in ways to appear normal, having most of them concentrated in the administration fields of finance and big corporations. The same competitiveness and lack of empathy, the same neurological process was observed by neuroscientists when a convicted serial killer recounted his murders and a CEO talked about signing away thousands of homes or denying healthcare. Now put THAT on your mind next time you read a newspaper.BTW, I think professor Rabin is wrong about the Dorian Grey point he made in his lectures, Dorians are the most common kind of monster we have, the petty, white, beautifull bigot in the neighborhood...;He&apos;d probably be in the boardroom of Monsanto, seeing he liked &quot;nature&quot; so much.;maybe he is ... who says he didn&apos;t lie about that funeral pyre.;Star Trek deals a lot with this question.  ;</string>

            <string>I just finished the Grimm reading last night and as usual, the Snow White story always puts me in mind of Christina Rossetti&apos;s &quot;Goblin Market.&quot;   I think it is the &quot;little men&quot; in both.   So, anyway, was wondering if anyone else had the same response to the stories either to Rossetti&apos;s poem or something else you have read.   It would be interesting to compile a list.   And if anyone&apos;s interested, here&apos;s a link to &quot;Goblin Market.&quot;   It&apos;s rather long, but a good read.      http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174262;</string>

            <string>Luis, I&apos;m also from Colombia, There is nothing you can do, I&apos;m doing about 7 courses, and only one have spanish subtitles, the only thing that could help you, Is downloading the subtitles in english and traslating them into spanish, but even then, they lack context.You need to practice your english overall, this course is intended to be for people with a high level of english, I failed that in the firts assigment and got a lot of down points because of some mistakes, I tried to avoid that in the second assigment, lets see how it goes.;There were not enough words to explain my thesis, I think I&apos;m not going to do good in this one.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;d also read   the   fairy tales of Perrault before reading these translations of Grimm&apos;s tales and   there are many differences as well as parallels. I know that   the stories in the form we have them now   are the result of   detailed and   complicated redactive processes,   rewritten for   the &apos;upper classes&apos; but   presenting themselves as peasant or foolk stories of the poor. Elements remain of   much earlier folk tales and myths and I thought a few times of Aesop&apos;s fables,   anecdotes from Hesiod and Homer as well as   the French medieval fabliaux, the   ribald (Rutebeuf) and disruptive stories   of Boccaccio and   of course Chaucer. ;It made me think of Abraham and Isaac, and also of Solomon telling the women to cut the baby in half to prove which was the real mother;I got a copy at my local library...it&apos;s an option for most of these books!;</string>
            <string>Such an interesting group of people! I&apos;m Tensy from Kansas (USA) and I&apos;m taking this course at the suggestion of my son who goes to the Univ. of Michigan and had heard great things about the professor. I am an academic/college librarian and also an attorney, in an earlier version of my life. I am very interested in the concept of MOOCs and have challenged my son and husband to each take a course this summer. It is leading to interesting dinner conversations on our progress! I have loved hard/techcentric Science Fiction since I was in middle school, although I am not a fan of fantasy. I was about the only girl in my classes who loved to read SciFi novels which made me popular with the guys ;-). I am thrilled to see so many people from other countries (I was born in Cuba and studied in Spain) and I can see how this course would be useful for people to polish their English writing skills. Looking forward to all the discussions and getting to &quot;virtually&quot; know everyone.;I love Bro. Grimms stories, on the other hand. It  s really interesting reading how your childhood stories, the ones that make you sleep, turn into dark and sometimes scary stories. I hate that at first, but now they surprise me and hook my atention. That  s the reasono I love Once upon a time, the ABC show. If you  d seen Red Hood charper, you know what I mean.;</string>
            <string>I think there are several different things going on. First, many contemporary writers and other novelists have used fairy tales as inspiration, or have alluded to them. This makes sense as well if you think of how hearing these stories might have been among the earliest memories some writers have, and if you believe as some do that fairy tale elements represent some kind of primal archetypes of the subconscious (Jungian interpretation). So allusions may be conscious and well as unconscious.  At the same time, you&apos;ll hear varying versions of these tales, both across cultures and even within European culture. The Grimm brothers collected these oral tales by traveling around the countryside. In many cases, as I understand it, they heard different versions and then picked and chose those elements they wanted to include. They may have cleaned up things and added some narrative consistency or causality. Then you have a variety of translators such as Lucy Crane or Padraic Column (the first version of Grimm tales I read) who translated the Grimms tales into English and so made other changes as well. Other compilers/authors such as Perrault or even HC Andersen put their own spin on these motifs. So the results are varying versions of the same stories. It&apos;s interesting to compare the versions and look for which differences might have resulted from the translation, or from whoever first wrote them down (perhaps taking a bit of literary license), or from the oral tradition itself.It&apos;s also interesting to me to see the parallels between many of these stories and folk tales from other cultures. For example, many cultures around the world have a version of the Cinderella tale. This seems to support, perhaps, the Jungian read, though perhaps it also speaks to cultural sharing and influence. It&apos;s hard to know what the original oral versions of these tales might have been, and how much has been changed over time.  In terms of literary interpretations of the fairy tales, I&apos;d definitely recommend the novel Possession by A.S. Byatt. One of the characters is an 19th century English Victorian poet who writes her own versions of fairy tales, definitely influenced by Grimms.  ;It is also my understanding that while the Grimms compiled oral tales, they put a bit of their own spin on them for their own purposes, or at least consistent with German romanticism movement. As I understand it, they also were dealing with varying versions of the same tales and had to pick and choose what to include. It&apos;s also interesting reading different translations of Grimm tales. The first translation I read was by Padraic Colum, which I&apos;d recommend. It seems somewhat less adorned and more matter of fact than the Lucy Crane, but of course also doesn&apos;t have the same evocative illustrations. One thing I&apos;ve heard and reflected on is that the original stories (partly as reflected in the Colum translation) are very matter of fact about the things that happen. Life was quite arbitrary and could be cruel. Children who strayed in the forest could be eaten by wolves, sickness could carry people away quite randomly. One thing that strikes me about fairy tales is how both the fantastic and the horrible are related and accepted without comment. One thing I did note in the Crane translation was a bit more of an overlay of morality. That bad things happen to bad people, rather than the more arbitrary kind of fate that may hang over the earlier stories. Perhaps a touch of English Victorian morality? But I&apos;ve also heard that the Grimms gave a bit of this kind of overlay as well. It&apos;s hard to know without being privvy to the original oral versions. Another thing I notice is a kind of merciless treatment of foolishness or distraction. Poor Clever Else -- that kind of cleverness (looking for trouble when none is around, day dreaming instead of working) was not to be tolerated. You can sometimes peel back the veils -- it seems to me -- and get a glimpse of what life truly must have been like back then living on the edge of the forest, and the edge of subsistence and violence.  ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;ve read different translations of Grimm&apos;s tales numerous times, even to my own children, and felt like I knew them pretty well. But I was very interested in Professor Rabkin&apos;s take on the stories and really appreciate how his final lecture this week pulled together elements and questions about the tales he&apos;d alluded to in previous lectures, while giving me more of an idea of the reasons and implications of the Grimm&apos;s &quot;scribal&quot; alterations to the tales they collected. Very interesting and thought provoking. And I never knew before that Cinderella was actually dancing in a squirrel fur slipper - that makes a lot more sense!  I&apos;m really enjoying the course and feel like I&apos;ve learned new insights on a lot of topics (European history, linguistics, etymology) that go beyond fantasy literature. I look forward to the future weeks of the course.  ;</string>
            <string>Miyazaki&apos;s movies are wonderful fantasy -- I love watching them with my children and on my own. I&apos;d HIGHLY recommend anyone watching Spirited Away if you&apos;ve not yet done so. My Neighbor Totoro is also wonderful (for younger kids especially), as is Castle in the Sky...any of his movies really.  I would also note that I see a lot of influences in Miyazaki&apos;s work - it&apos;s interesting how he combines motifs from European fairy tales with traditional Japanese motifs. For me, Zeniba (the sister who lives in the country - I may be confusing them) reminds me of Baba Yaga from Russian fairy tales - and I love the train ride through the watery landscape - and the music really adds to the mood.;I read a lot of children&apos;s literature to my own kids. I&apos;ve noticed that a lot of books written for children, especially recently, can be pretty forgettable. But the books my children like best tend to be ones that may not fit into the definition of Children&apos;s Literature that the lecture laid out. Plenty of books -- classics for children -- don&apos;t have simplified vocabulary and the meaning can work on a variety of levels. The plots may also be complicated, and far from episodic. Maybe it&apos;s just rereading them as adults, but I&apos;m often impressed with the style, narrative structure, and treatment of alternative realities and fantasy elements. I&apos;m thinking of books such as  Peter Pan, Princess and the Goblin, Tom&apos;s Midnight Garden, Children of Green Knowe  or  Wind in the Willows. I&apos;d also include a lot of books in the New York Review of Books Children&apos;s Classics series.  Maybe it&apos;s just because I am rereading them as an adult that I see all of the layers -- time passing and mortality seem to hang over many of them, as does the fallibility of adults. But the vocabulary is also pretty advanced. I think it&apos;s a disservice to children and writers both to say you need simplistic plots, simplistic language and happy endings to engage children. In the lecture, Professor Rabkin mentions that the children addressed in children&apos;s lit are those we want to believe we have. We want to see children a certain way. But I think children get more of the darkness and ambiguity in life than we may think they do. I&apos;m speaking more of 8-12 year olds, though, not of little kids. But it&apos;s interesting to reread some of the books that were my own favorites when I was a kid. They all have a dark thread, or ambiguities to them I must have picked up on as a child.  I do think there&apos;s a huge difference between picture books and books for older elementary school, however.   I&apos;d be interested in what other people think.  ;As someone who always has been intrigued by the personal story of Mary Shelley, without ever actually reading Frankenstein, the chance to finally be made to read this novel was one of the attractions of the course. I have to say I am disappointed. I get that she&apos;s trying to make the creature more appealing than Frankenstein himself, but really -- 60% into the novel -- I have little patience for either. I don&apos;t buy that the creature obtained such a world view just through overhearing a reading of the classics. I don&apos;t believe that his feelings for humanity changed so abruptly for the worse. The writing feels so superficial to me -- the worthy, disenfranchised French family, the simple but intolerant peasants, the wily, untrustworthy Turkish merchant. I find myself getting very annoyed through the whole thing. I keep waiting to be surprised. Maybe it&apos;s my modern sensibility, but I&apos;m trying to understand why this novel has had so much resonance. It seems to wear its message so close to its sleeve. I find myself missing Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein;  a little comic relief would be welcome. I was thinking Dracula would be the chore to read, but it felt more multi-dimensional than this. Frankenstein just feels like an allegory. Maybe I&apos;m not reading it carefully enough?  ;</string>
            <string>The story is written at a time, where it would not be easy to complain about the society. Could this be a story about that when the gab between the very priveliged and the public in general are too huge, the public will take matters in their owen hand (allthough I admit that the price paid in this story is harsh and that the sympathy are tilting towards the princess, but still, if you as a storyteller must conceal your points...)? If this is the case, the story I suppose was not written for/or told to children. Could it be that the stories are both written for/told to children and adults? I guess that one will never know for sure? Course the stories I believe were only collected by the Grimm brothers - not written by or originally told by them. ;</string>

            <string>I find it strange that Mina Harker in Chapter 21 says that she knew Dracula at once    from the description of the others    as she herself sees him as described in her own journal of the 22. September in Chapter 13.     Quote from Mina harker   s journal from the 22. September, Chapter 13:       I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cartwheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano   s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath,    My God     _He (Jonathan, red.) was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pinted beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face. It was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal   s  _       In Chapter 21 where Mina Harker is forced to drink blood from Dracula   s chest she afterwards tells her friends about her meeting with the vampire:       Beside the bed, as if he had stopped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face, the high aquiline nose,   _.   Mistake?Surely she would remember seeing Dracula earlier, or?          ;Right - she did not know then that it was Dracula. But surely Jonathan told her, who it was he had seen, after she had been reading his diary (they are in fact very keen on getting all the facts together in writing, so they can learn from the documents). But maybe he looked very different during the daytime (although I don&apos;t really think so). ;</string>
            <string>The fear component is a likely explanation to this reoccurring theme.   As mentioned previously, it could also tie into the youthful thoughts that perhaps &quot;they&quot; really aren&apos;t your parents.   After a failed marriage, though, I am inclined to believe that the reason it is so often a theme is the likelihood of people changing.   A natural process of life is to grow and change, leading to the saying she/he isn&apos;t the person I married.   This could only be further exasperated by the frequency of arranged marriages throughout the eras of these writings.  ;</string>
            <string>The Bride and Switch is a very old motif - didn&apos;t Issac labor for 7 years to marry Rachel and wound up with Leah instead?   Temporary triumph of wrong over right, but with a little more effort (7 years more labor, magic singing birds, whatever), wrong is put right.   Actually a hopeful message.;Of course, as in all writing, you have to remember the audience.   The Jacob story (and yes, I got the wrong patriarch) was primarily intended to show genealogy; I don&apos;t get the impression that the Grimm brothers were collecting stories with that in mind.   ;</string>
            <string>Some of the commenters may be flashing back to the 60s and the Jefferson Airplane song &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;.

            <string>The captain swore in multiple languages (polyglot).   Sailors have colorful expletives, so I just assumed that all the bloom and blood business was another of Stoker&apos;s theatrically-overwritten dialect along those lines.  ;Oh, I don&apos;t disagree in the slightest. But I stick by the &quot;theatrically-overwritten dialect&quot; comment; Stoker slips into dialect in his melodrama (and broad farce) in so many places that it sometimes got in the way of enjoying the book.   Some of the material I had to read aloud to get the sense of what the character was trying to say.;</string>
            <string>Throughout the stories there are things (or people) pretending to be other things (or people). It&apos;s not just brides. But Clarissa Pinkola Estes writes well about how the brides are exploring their own dark places. ;Do the bookstores (the few remaining) stock these as fantasy? Are they ebooks? Where are these writers? They sound great. Wonder why i dont know them. ;Do you know the story of Demeter and Persephone? Winter was sad, so i guess snow was sad, but to farming people rain would be welcome and, as you say, merry. It all depends on the cultural connotation, i guess.;</string>
            <string>Children love repetition. They&apos;ll drive you nuts wanting to be read the same story over and over. The storytellers undoubtedly knew that when they made thse up. The number of repetitions could have varied and maybe the Grimms themselves made it specifically 3. Also they sometimes deliberately vary the wording the second and third times. ;</string>

Here and there a character will say &quot;We&apos;re in God&apos;s hands,&quot; but no overtly religious people are called on to help or instruct.  Also, i wonder about the other anti-vampirics, so to speak, such as the garlic. Do we believe the evil eye business is as powerful a protector as a cross? Is the indiginous folklore as powerful as the Christian, or only kind of a stopgap, local measure?  This ties in, of course, to the day/night stuff, that Dracula is weak in the light of day.;Is there any way that these segments could be released a little earlier?     While i&apos;m thinking about Dracula, i&apos;d like to get started on the next book, and it would be nice to have the benefit of &quot;before you read&quot; actually come out before i read, maybe 2weeks ahead of that &quot;class?&quot; If people start reading later than i do, they could just wait &amp; watch that video whenever they&apos;re ready for it.;</string>

            <string>There&apos;s the fear of losing one&apos;s power to another. Women are powerful and must be constrained by the bonds of matrimony to keep order.

            <string>I   d like to remember that fairytales are useful as    warnings    or    lessons   . I   ve just read    King Thrushbeard    and this is a strong element: teaching youngsters not to be pride. But I can   t help thinking of Clarissa Pinkola Estes    (cited by Cindy) Jungian interpretation of the    Bluebeard   : maybe all characters are faces of the bride   s own identity, her very psyche. If it is the case, what would a switch mean? In    King Thrushbeard    it seems to me that the switches show a enforcement, or hardening, of the superego. Would I be overreaching? It seems to fit with the    educational function    of fairytales.  - Apologies for the clumsy English, I   m not a native speaker :-);</string>

            <string>I love the different viewpoints as well. One of the main differences between the series and the tv show is that you never see Robb&apos;s view in the books, yet you do in the series. I feel his narrative is more powerful in the books, because you only see him from the view of others. It makes his motivations a mystery, and also helps him be a more sympathetic character.;</string>
            <string>I think it is hard to write a modern fairytale, because so many have been done before, and most know them, through Disney, Mother Goose, or otherwise, that it is hard to make something new. I think Myst is an example of a modern fairytale, though that could be put under mythology as well, and NK Jemisin also has an undercurrent of fairytale to go along with her mythology.;Rule of three is big in music as well. Most of the time I have seen it in this book it seems to have something to do with ressurection, three days for Christ to rise and all, which would certainly correlate to magic too, in its way.;I went with stupidity as well, the bliss of the ignorant. Also, that trusting strangers is not the best, and that if you can look on the bright side of life you will be happier no matter what your decisions/life brings.;</string>
            <string>I have tried to read Dracula multiple times since high school and have never managed to finish. Glad this course covers it, even though I hate Stoker&apos;s style, because it is a classic I have always wanted to read.That being said, I cannot understand how anyone would hate the magic that is Alice. Especially Through the Looking Glass. Sorry you were tainted by the Disney version. I strongly encourage you to watch this version:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgaakhgbL9s&amp;list=PLBCC3CC5763586ACA.

            <string>The essay is fine and it give new direction to read it critically. though it has some topographical error.Alice is a girl which has childish fantasy but a mature mind. the whole story revolves around this process. It has an adventurous journey. In that adventure process somehow we feel like Alice has grown up.;The important thing is the narration of the fantasy text if you cannot narrate them with curiosity they are not interested by readers.  ;Frankenstein and Gothic elements  Mary Shelley Frankenstein is also known as The modern Prometheus.In a sense it is very near to that . secondly Mary Shelley being a women writer has created a science fiction. She has a reason with the cobweb of thriller added int.  The element of darkness and large hall are the basic elements of gothic culture which we find in this work.  It is a powerful work where the mind and machine and science go hand in hand.   ;It is more challenging then the stereotype one.It gives you an opportunity to think out of the box.;</string>
            <string>I adore ASOIAF. I find the world compelling and brilliant - though I totally would not want to be anywhere in that universe. I&apos;d last an hour. Maybe. And then probably die of an infected toenail. ;) That seems to be a common criticism of GRRM - that the nihilism of the world is just for the sake of it at times. For some, that drives people away... for me, it just adds to the draw of the story and the interesting characters.    As a writer, I find myself drawn to that use of an unreliable narrator for every chapter. I think it has to be used with great artistry and planning in mind, as there has to be a purpose in using it as a device to progress the story. It can&apos;t be done for just the sake of it - which I fear others may attempt to do... still, I would love to dabble with this, but the planning involved is mind-blowing. My favorite character? That is a tough one. I find myself very much enjoying Tyrion&apos;s chapters. And Jamie became very entertaining once he became a chapter character. Arya is a very interesting character... and I look forward to seeing her journey being translated on the show. Sansa&apos;s chapters get very interesting later on in the series, so that is pretty compelling. In the show, I just feel bad for her. But yeah, I think I&apos;d have to say that Tyrion is my overall favorite. Not very surprising, huh? ;That was pretty much my impression, too. There are probably other elements at work here - a nod to materialism and living in the present, but first off, it is established that he is a fool - he just isn&apos;t aware of it. The reader is. I think it must be just one of those fun stories that is supposed to make people laugh while teaching them something about considering the impact of decisions and living on whimsy. Who knows. In any case, it was a fun read. Much like &quot;Death of the Hen&quot;. ;I loved all fairy tales and mythologies growing up. I still have my copy of the Grimm&apos;s tales on my shelf from when I was a child - with the spine well worn and the cover nearly coming off. ...it probably has a lot to do with developing how my brain worked growing up and into adolescence. I guess I also felt they were more honest than the &apos;Disney&apos; treatment. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I was a total Disney brat growing up, but my parents were clever enough to engender a love and respect of the written word early. ;I had a good bit of trouble with the kindle edition of this book. It had so many errors and was troublesome to decipher. Still, I managed through it and made notes of the stories that were shown oddly and I read those online. I do hope you don&apos;t give up. Yes, it is a lot to read, but these are such magical stories... I feel like it is worth the effort. :) ;It honestly rekindled my childhood love for these stories. I enjoyed reading them immensely. As a writer... I think it probably did change me as I began to recognize so many common tropes that are used in all sorts of story plots we see in modern books and film. Perhaps not an anthropomorphic fox is utilized all the time, but you get my meaning. It all feels very familiar and homey. ;</string>
            <string>Absolutely. Thanks for bringing it up. It is a lovely thought that I shall enjoy pondering while I read the books assigned. :) I think any of the companions make for an interesting &quot;Alice&quot;. ;Linda, I believe that is generally true (I may be wrong!), but when you quote something from the book in question, you should cite that as they are not your words, but those of another. ;If I came across one that grossly exceeded the word count, they would get a 1 from me with a very clear explanation as to why. It is one thing to have a fluke with your browser that let you submit an essay beyond the word count restriction. It is even okay, to me, that somehow... it escaped your attention that you went a little over and the system didn&apos;t let you know that you couldn&apos;t submit because of that. I think I could get past that. But when you go to such an extent to double the word count and beyond... I&apos;m sorry, but at that point, you know you&apos;re out of line. Or you didn&apos;t read the directions. In both cases, you should be penalized.   I apologize if that seems harsh, but I know I am not alone in how much trouble it was to bring the essay down to an appropriate word count while keeping some coherency of your thought processes. ;1000 words is a good deal larger than 320 (or even 10% over that word count). I don&apos;t think anyone here was suggesting that they automatically give a 1 without checking to verify the word count, however. ;Thanks for this! ;I submitted something. I am not happy with it. It wasn&apos;t inspired. It was like herding cats to try to get something I could even remotely be okay with to submit. No, I wasn&apos;t waiting until the last second to get something together to submit - I just couldn&apos;t find focus for the thesis...something that I really felt I could get behind. I like the Alice stories fine, but... I just couldn&apos;t get into the meat of anything that wasn&apos;t far too abstract and would require many more than 320 words to get into. I felt frustrated and annoyed... no good. On the other hand, I am REALLY looking forward to reading Dracula. :) ;</string>

            <string>Well, in the Dune series, eyes had a pretty significant symbolism - the blue color, the transformation, the spice addiction, what was gained from consuming melange, ect. ;</string>
            <string>For me, the brilliance of the books is that you can see the cogs of plot turning at all times. No matter how many characters are involved, how many settings there are, you can see all of them interlocking and moving things forward. His ability to vividly describe conflict and in particular the abyssal nature of war resonates strongly - how it can be very small actions that cause such havoc.  ;</string>
            <string>I have read all of the GOT books released so far and I really enjoyed reading them. I feel that the author does a great job of conveying the atrocities that occur during a war and how everyone takes things such as rape and pillaging a given, however horrific they are. I sometimes had a difficult time reading the books because of all the blatant violence against women and had to put the book down for a few weeks. I think, however, that the political intrigue is spot on and entertaining. My favorite characters are Dany, Tyrion, and Arya because they are balanced in their view of morality and survival, which is why their characters have lasted so long while others that see the world as black or white have died. On a side note, if you enjoyed or enjoy reading The Song of Fire and Ice series, I suggest reading the Wheel of Time series. It&apos;s much longer (I believe it&apos;s 14 books), but it&apos;s less consistently violent and the author actually does a better job of embodying the characters in their separate narratives (including calling certain characters different names in the narrative, not just the dialogue). It also has very strong female characters that are all perceptively different. It also has strong political intrigue that makes you want to keep reading. I read both series at the same time and I enjoyed both. ;My husband said the story is telling us not to help our friends. He said this jokingly, of course. ;I remember having an epic nightmare where the Red Queen was trying to cut off my head and I was running through a tunnel that never ended. That was after I saw the Disney version of the story. I don&apos;t remember if I enjoyed the story or not, though. I didn&apos;t actually read the books until High School and I enjoyed them. After I took a linguistics course in college I enjoy them even more. If I find a small child, I shall try to corrupt their young mind with Alice and log the results.;Thank you. I&apos;ll let our exchange student know about these. ;</string>

            <string>I don&apos;t think the thesis has to be long (since the essay is so short), but there should be a clear statement that conveys what you&apos;re about to argue.   Then, the support should lead to the conclusion. I do think there should be a conclusion because it wraps everything up nicely and gives the argument more &quot;umph&quot;.;</string>
            <string>Hoi ik woon ook in Rotterdam;Dat gaat lukken, ik heb veel zin om alles te lezen.marjolijn;I think all the comments above are very intersting and it is an important topic.Knowing what people read can also help you to understand where their ideas are from. And then you can try to let them see how these ideas although written down are not evidencial truths. I always wondered how my well-thinking father-in-law got his patronising ideas about race until after his death when I got into the possesion of his books. They were mainstream informative books with very patronising ideas about non-white races. This evidently formed him. If I had known that before I could have pointed out the language use and demeaning character of some of the texts. I think he would be surprised, but also more aware of how his thinking was influenced. He was a gentle man and never meant anyone any harm, but through his books had a paternal/colonial attitude and language use to all non-whites, I do not think he was ever aware of.So we should take our reading to friends and family and try to talk to them about how stories can form us through their language use. And that we should all be aware of how we tell stories to others, even if it is mere gossip. ;The problem summary: I can save my essay, but not submit it for grading. The button stays inactive.

            <string>My essay will be about this. That there is a paradox when we look at the wafer and the blood. It may be interesting to know that when I did anthropology classes I was told that some tribes who had canabalistic rituals were converted to christianity. What the indigenous people found most difficult to understand was that they could no longer eat other humans, which, had a spiritual side, but were then told by priests to eat the body of christ.   So the whole christian ritual of the eucharist is a paradox difficult to explain.;Sorry this comment was meant for David Grigg see below. I misunderstood the location of the comment button.;</string>

            <string>Thank you! That was a useful link.;I think it must be a technical error of some sort. The word count does not recognize plural possessive apostrophe as two words.

            <string>Thank you for posting this. I had wondered about the same thing. I have some knowledge of literary theory and use it in my essays. However, the people reading them don&apos;t always understand. I think this is normal though because even if such knowledge is preferred for this course, it&apos;s not mandatory. What i don&apos;t like is peers who criticize based on grammar they don&apos;t understand (i had a peer who failed to understand the reflexive function of the word &apos;themselves&apos;. But i also had some very constructive criticism for the same essay which balanced that bad one). I try to give an honest   evaluation regardless because i find that it also helps improve my writing skills.;</string>

            <string>Personally, I think that the  analyzing of these fables is the activity that they would prefer for us to be doing. They made these tales to be cautionary warnings for children, especially young girls to prevent them from going down the wrong path. What many people tend to neglect when they are analyzing older works is that due to the age that children were married, which was much earlier, many precautionary tales explained concepts that many assume would not be talked of, such as procraetion, and finding the right husband. Young women were also far more vulnerable than they are today, as they had to fear dangers such as lustful men, and the shame associated with having a child out of wedlock. As long as we look at these fables, keeping in mind the societal paradigms of the era, the brothers Grimm would be gald, as they had done their job. As writers, they were meant to entertain, but they prided themselves on being the teachers of the next generation also. They wanted tradition to prevail, and for young people to be ready for the reality of their world.;I don&apos;t know if this will help, but usually rabbits are associated with the character flaw of fleeting, of not being permenant, or committed. Maybe he symbolizes an unfaithful man who will leave her the minute he finds a more beautiful woman? Foxes, who also symbolize cunning, are noted as being intllectual creatures in fairy tales. That may be the reason as to why he was the made the clerk.;</string>

            <string>There are many translations of Alice in Russian, but the best is one by Demurova;I reckon initially the teachers intended to require 4 reviews from every student, but some students from the earlier courses just failed to fully participate in the writing/reviewing activities.

            <string>...but we, an audience, are &quot;intelligent&quot; and fluent users of an academic English so I guess no contractions :-)  ;I have just finished my assignment and the words are counted automatically at the bottom of the page, so you will have no problem with following the requirement.

            <string>I don&apos;t think you need a title Karen, everyone reading this work will know that it&apos;s your assignment on Grimm&apos;s Tales, and your thesis (which might otherwise be presented in the title) should be explained concisely and clearly within your assignment.;just be aware that there are selected readings from Grimms Tales (detailed in the course syllabus tab directly under the list of books), it&apos;s not necessary to read or write about the whole book.  ;</string>
            <string>Just a wee reminder of the &apos;find and replace&apos; feature in your word processing programmes, incase you&apos;ve used contractions or hyphens or what not and have been given a higher word count with the coursera counter than your own. I was over 20 words more last night as I had step-mothers and step-children throughout my essay. Find and replace is much quicker than going through each one manually on coursera. Just be careful to check that you&apos;re not missing capitals at the start of sentences if you are changing, say, &apos;step-mother&apos; to &apos;stepmother&apos;. :);I think the frustration is we&apos;ve read so many stories and even if we&apos;ve whittled them down to a select few for the essay it is hard to include everything in such a short word count. I think this needs to be borne in mind when we get our feedback too. We&apos;re bound to get comments suggesting what else we could have included but it&apos;s important to remember that these are often just alternate suggestions or approaches that we might have taken and not to get too disheartened. ;I used In Our Time throughout my history degree - its a fantastic resource. Never thought about checking for this course so thanks for the heads up Oscar!;Hopefully you&apos;re on the right track now Mark. I&apos;m sure reading the peer responses will help too and let you see different approaches others have taken. And when you get your get to read the comments everyone has made about your essay then hopefully you can build from that - we&apos;ve got 10 weeks so don&apos;t worry if your essays aren&apos;t perfect at the start - it&apos;s a learning curve and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be in a much better and more confident place a few weeks down the line with a few of these under your belt. :);Fun link!

            <string>Nationalism was not a &apos;bad thing&apos; when it first began to gain ground after the ideals of the French Revolution spread throughout Europe. It was about a sense of belonging and feeling part of a nation. Many Germanic peoples were subject to rule by others - such as those under the Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) empire. The same is the case for Italy. Both Italy and Germany became countries in their own right in the late nineteenth century so the Grimm Tales are just part of the art created in this period that reflected a national pride and a sense of &apos;German-ness&apos; before the creation of an actual German state.   It is easy with the benefit of hindsight and what we know of the horrors of National Socialism under the Nazis to credit the Grimm Tales with a different agenda to what they originally had. This is dangerous ground and we need to understand stories in the context in which they were written. Of course it&apos;s equally valid to look at the influence of stories on future generations and this is where the morals and politics of the time of reading (such as when Nazis were gaining ground) would come into play.I think nationalism has gained a negative connotation, largely due to right wing extremists such as the Nazis, but it&apos;s important to remember that it also means patriotism and loyalty to one&apos;s country and this is probably closer to the original meaning of the word at the time the Grimm Brothers were writing.  ;</string>
            <string>Yeah, totally agree that sitting on the tail means that he seduced her.  I think that the story is about pregnancy out of wedlock, than eventually leaving an unrewarding marriage to return home (chastened, perhaps, wiser certainly) to her mother ;In some cultures white symbolizes birth, black death and red coming of age (menstruation).. ;I think that these comments are insightful and thought provoking.  Thanks. This tale (and others in the similar vein of the bad winning over the good) bothered me at first.  I was expecting the tales to teach a moral, as the &quot;sanitized&quot; versions of the tales that have been handed down to our generation do.  The tales that show the cheater winning (clever gretel, Hans, to name a few) caused me to morally flinch.  But if the purpose of the tales is to teach children human nature in all of its complexities, then I begin to see the alcoholic, the loyal mother, the wayward lost soul, the cunning trickster, and on and on.  Then, I find it a pity that we are not giving children of today the same life lessons.. Instead,, they get the happily ever after morality, where the good girl is rewarded and the bad punished.  Frankly, life doesn&apos;t usually happen that way.  Kids could use more of the original material. ;I note that when things occur in threes in the stories, the first two times are passed by then the third is acted apon in the case of resisting an impulse, or something happens in the case of something being revealed. It&apos;s as if the first two times can be ignored, resisted, but the third tips the balance toward inevitabilit ;I I think that this is a story about a man without conscience (he steals the fruits of another&apos;s labor), without values (he seduces the innocent), without empathy (he can&apos;t understand why she won&apos;t make merry while being put to work on her own wedding feast) who learns remorse only when he has gone too far. ;</string>
            <string>She was presented as a girl, maiden, and as I understood it, a child. I didn&apos;t pick up on any &quot;seducing&quot; so much as manipulation. At no point did she express feelings of any kind for the rabbit- most of the story seemed about control and abuse. The rabbit threatened her, by making it clear that he would continue to consume them, by consuming their source of sustenance. (their garden) I never spotted any desire on her part, only sadness.;I agree, the wedding guests emphasized how isolated she was from her mother, her home. I was surprised by how recognizable the methods of abuse were seeing as it is such an old story.  ;I weep in sorrow and joy. I&apos;ve cried out of anger, and pain, and surprise.The rain during a hurricane is the same rain that falls soft in spring, it just feels different.;Has anyone else felt uneasy while combing through The Rabbit Bride?  It&apos;s a grimm tale, so of course it&apos;s dark, but I found this one especially creepy. (and creepier still, each time I read it again.)So mother and  daughter live in this garden. (a haven, a perfect place. symbolic of purity, beauty, innocence. ex: the garden of eden, the secret garden)The rabbit is a he/his/him: if I were to replace the word rabbit, the fitting word is man, not boy. The girl however, is always girl, maiden, and then bride. She is a child. The rabbit instructs her &quot;come, maiden. sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch.&quot; which is obviously sexual.  Day two he returns, repeats. This is a threat- you comply or I consume. (destroy their garden, they have nothing= the rabbit will take her life.)  If anyone else saw disney&apos;s beauty and the beast as a child, the rabbit reminds me of gaston- a man who pursued a girl by threatening to put her father away. It wears the mask of persistent courting, but is driven by the rabbit&apos;s desire to possess the girl. He leaves her no other option but to be his bride.I noticed something odd and I&apos;m unsure if it&apos;s a result of german to english translation, but thought it worth pointing out. A rabbit hutch is a cage or box, whereas a rabbit den or hole is their home in the wild. If it&apos;s   intentional, it fits the rabbit&apos;s treatment of her as a thing for him to have/keep.Those were some of the bits I found most interesting, would seriously love to hear other viewpoints.  (also: the ending held the most meaning for me. she escaped and in her place left the rabbit...a thing. an object. a doll.);I&apos;m not sure I agree that the doll as something to be loved. The phantom (if I recall correctly) is a character with a surplus of emotion that drives his desire to possess a beautiful girl, so that she can&apos;t leave him. his disfigurement and isolation push him to obsession. He feels genuine love. The rabbit however, did not seem to care about the bride he&apos;d broken, but that his bride was ruined(dead). Whether it was a doll or a girl did not seem to matter much.;oops, didn&apos;t mean to post it under general discussions.  ;I agree that she was lonely, but I who specifically did she disobey? What were her duties? I can understand the running away part, though it could be that she was simply following her mother&apos;s instructions to get rid of the rabbit. I&apos;m unsure when it comes to placing responsibility on the girl, with her mother&apos;s instructions in one ear, and the rabbit&apos;s demands in the other. These aren&apos;t thoughts I had when I initially read the story, it&apos;s great to hear others thoughts, thank you!;&quot;our need to derive meaning an pattern, even if none exists.&quot;  If I read a story and find pattern and meaning and magic and a moral-If a story that isn&apos;t very good, that lacks in charm, that is nothing more than hack technique provides this-Maybe the most important thing this story can offer, is a clearer path to the things that exist within me.That is valuable, and I&apos;m sorry you&apos;re (dis)missing it.This story is still here for a reason.;</string>
            <string>Love that reading of Six Soldiers of Fortune! :)As I read it, I wondered how we would react to superheroes - who we normally expect to use their powers for the good of the world (so to speak) - if they used their powers for their own benefit...either alone or together.. Would they then become &apos;supervillains&apos;?;</string>
            <string>Hi guys, I love the way that The Rabbit&apos;s Bride has been looked at here in your discussion. I also see it as a metaphor for careless or hasty sexual relationships and warning against the perils of such.  In Six Soldiers of Fortune, however, I found it more difficult to find meaning further than &apos;be careful of judging others&apos; and &apos;be careful of making bargains you may not want to/be able to keep&apos;. I am halfway through my first read through at this point, and it is extremely interesting to read all of your thoughts and ideas, so thanks to all of you for participating in the forums.;I have not come across   The Five Chinese brothers, or the 5 Blind Men and the Elephant, I will have to look those stories up. By any chance does anyone know the author of either story, or which type of folklore they are from? A book title containing either story would be really helpful if anyone knows.;Thanks! I always seem to forget that Wikipedia exists for some reason.;Also, did anyone else think of the deathly hallows from the Harry Potter books when they were reading &apos;The Raven&apos;? The stick, the cloak and the horse?  Along with the three spots of blood on the handkerchief in &apos;The Goose Girl&apos; , are three&apos;s special in some way? Is it a device of some sort? I know that three is a special number in that humans are more likely to remember or respond to things in threes, like political soundbites and such, so is this just random, arbitrary number choice or is a group of three, or a trinity even, meaningful in some way?  Edit: I have just read &apos;Cat and Mouse In Partnership, and the cat actually mentions &apos;Good things come in threes..&apos; in the story. I am wondering if there is a religious influence, considering the time of writing/transcribing. This would also possibly go toward explaining the way that some stories seem to be thickly veiled parables for adult situations/behaviour.  I just found the thread on threes, sorry this is in the wrong place.;It would be fascinating to know which stories were written by the brothers, if any. It would be fun to compare them with collected tales. What a lovely idea.;This was one of my thoughts too...a &apos;selfishness leads to destruction type moral.&apos; But then I also thought of it as &apos;ignorance will lead to destruction&apos; when the cock et al blindly do random tasks before receiving help and this could also be a &apos;too many cooks spoil the broth&apos; type message. However when I really look at it, it seems to become a microcosm for life. The food chain shown in the animals, or &apos;mourners&apos;, the ignorance of the hen who choked being perpetuated by every other character in the story until, at the end, everybody dies. That is basically how life works if you strip it down to the basics. in a very pessimistic way.;Thanks so much for this! I have no doubt that this will help people out.;A course on the historic period of these tales would be amazing. I feel like so much more could be gotten from many stories just by placing them in their original context. Not much, even one short lecture on the specific time period in which a book was written would be at the very least interesting. A 15 minute video discussing the period   of each of the books we are going to cover would be fantastic in helping draw out both conscious and subconscious influences and ideas. If only such videos existed. I love the thought of learning some of those &apos;for a specific reason&apos; tales.;I think of it like this.. we have jerry springer/jeremy kyle/oprah etc to see the problems other people have in their lives, plus we live in very open and accepting times. Now, (and this is the first modern day vaguely similar lifestyle I could find) imagine an Amish kid, raised by very religious, very moral parents who want to protect their kid from temptations. This stuff is very likely the type of &apos;life lessons&apos; that type of kid gets growing up, while the secular population get theirs from the modern world, media, tv, music etc. I think people back when these were written/transcribed most likely were either religious, or watchful of their words and actions BECAUSE of religion, and the influence on perceived morality would have been huge even in the most basic terms.  ;Hi, I have not yet finished the entire book, and I am just having ideas that may or may not be correct, simply another interpretation.   I will try to explain my line of thinking on the religion thing. So, the first indicator for me, was the way in which some stories are so heavily veiled that the &apos;hidden&apos;   meaning or parable can be completely missed by most readers at first glance. This reminded me of the way that strict religion can impart wisdom on themes that may be distasteful to their moral viewpoint ( promiscuity in &apos;The Rabbit&apos;s Wife&apos;, or the protection afforded by the three drops of blood in &apos;The Goose Girl as a metaphor for menstruation, meaning the female is &apos;safe&apos; and protected from pregnancy) and also, the recurring symbolism invoked by the trinity, or groups of three as a metaphor for the holy trinity, ( the three miraculous items needed to ascend the glass mountain leading to the reward of saving the princess as a metaphor for the trinity of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit leading to the reward of eternal life and Heaven). Threes are also seen as a good thing in some of the other stories. I am still reading so there may well be more of this. I used the example of an Amish child being taught life lessons because it is the strictest religious modern lifestyle I could think of that would come close to the type of communities people must have lived in at the time these stories were transcribed.;Hi, I too am reading the pdf version and I felt exactly the same at first. It IS a chore to read a book in pdf format, but the stories are not as lame as they seem. Can I suggest you look at the discussion thread on the first story, &apos;The Rabbit&apos;s Wife&apos;? You may be surprised by some of the meanings that folks have derived from that one simple, seemingly meaningless tale. If you are still not interested in analysing the Grimm Tales after looking through that discussion fair enough. I only suggest you have a look in case you were too distracted/annoyed by the crappy format to analyse at all. It certainly has made it less of a chore for me although the stories are still boring, it&apos;s more the symbolism and hidden meanings that have made it enjoyable.  ;Congratulations! I think it is great that you are preparing so thoroughly for University, well done for getting in :);I think that there is a victimisation of men who dare interact with prepubescent and/or teenage girls. He may very well have been a paedophile but there is absolutely no evidence to support that claim. Innocence and beauty can be captivating and inspiring without necessarily being sexual, and as for the photographs it has been said repeatedly that the poses were what was fashionable and popular at that period in time. Maybe the little girl was his muse and nothing more.;For those struggling with their kindle&apos;s, the kindle for pc app is maybe a slightly better option for some. It can be difficult to read an entire book on your pc, but being able to go back and forth seems far easier on a pc than the kindle. It may be worth a try. Also great for those who do not own a kindle to access the free e books on their pc that are available in the kindle store;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m sorry you are having to leave the course, but I am happy that you realised this quickly and saved yourself some time. I don&apos;t think I could do two courses at once, I forced myself to stick with one when i was choosing, and I am relieved that I did, as you say it is a lot of work for someone who has done no pre reading. Best of luck with your other course :)  ;Tanya I have to agree with you, I got a 4, which I am extremely happy with, considering the effort I put in, ie not anywhere near enough! I had zero citations or references also, mainly because I have very little education from formal sources, (I am only formally educated to primary school level) and so I am unused to essay writing and the formal structure of essays. The peer review was AWESOME for me, because it afforded me the opportunity to see how other people wrote their essays, and I learned how I should be writing an essay, and how I can reference things. I am really happy with the criticism I got as well, because it was constructive and informative, and it will help me with my next essay.  ;To clarify, I mean the grading other people aspect of peer review, not my own feedback. I learned a lot about different styles by reading peoples work, and it really helped me.  It seems like many people are disappointed by the lack of feedback though, so maybe this is something that should be addressed by the professor. Maybe people do not realise that they have the ability to give feedback as a reader, maybe they feel unqualified to comment, maybe they&apos;re just lazy or have no time. Either way, I think the professor could include a little bit of advice regarding feedback, to reassure those who are uncomfortable commenting.  Maybe we could start a thread where those needing more feedback can post their essay to be reviewed by people who feel comfortable doing it? Since it can be done anonymously I think it is a good idea, especially since some people got far less feedback than others.;Do you guys think it would be helpful for a reviewer to state what mark they gave in the comments section? If it is helpful to folks, then maybe we can ask that people do that? It wouldn&apos;t reach everyone, but it might help a little if at least some reviewers left a note of the score. I didn&apos;t even think of doing this, but it would be very easy to start a comment with &apos;I gave you a 3 because....&apos; or similar.;Finally! I have been thinking that this type of thread is a great idea, and I was wondering why there was no place to ask for extra feedback yet. Thanks for starting this thread, I hope people use it and benefit from it, especially those people who received little or no valuable feedback from their grading. Remember that you can post anonymously if you wish.;</string>
            <string>My mind also immediately went to Harry Potter... I wonder if JKRowling was familiar with that story. ;Re: Christian influence on the tales&apos; morals, I definitely saw a parallel between the beheading of the twins in Faithful John and the God&apos;s command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in Genesis. Personally I find it morally inexcusable to kill a child in either case, but it does make sense within a values system that exalts faith and obedience to a higher power above all else. In Faithful John, all of the King&apos;s prior problems had been caused by his reluctance to trust John&apos;s word. I think it entirely possible that John is a stand in for the Judeo-Christian god in this story. ;They are incredibly sanitized in many cases--- I believed for most of my life that the Grimm&apos;s stories were the Real Original Thing-- and about the darkest versions of the tales you were going to get. I was in for quite a surprise when I traced the history of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; -- it is taken from a much older tale in which the princess is raped in her sleep by a married king and only awakens months later after unconsciously delivering his twins. When she goes to find him, his jealous wife tries to boil her alive in oil... I was a bit taken aback to say the least. ;Definitely... Desirability is subjective. A bottle of water is worth more than a million dollars if you haven&apos;t had a drink in days. Hans figures out what he needs at the moment, and is willing to give it up when it no longer applies... I can think of a lot of people who hoard things they don&apos;t need because they might want them again someday, and all those things eventually become a burden to take care of, much like Han&apos;s stones. ;I had the same reaction... I started out irritated by the story but by the end was very charmed by it.  ;I don&apos;t think it matters that Hans never explicitly states this philosophy. Fairy tale characters often simply embody a certain trait or virtue, without breaking down exactly why they are doing what they&apos;re doing for the audience. ;I remember another similar Grimm&apos;s story that I don&apos;t think is in our reading (though I&apos;m only 3/4 of the way through), where the Father cuts off his daughter&apos;s hands in order to get out of a deal he&apos;d made with the devil. Now I&apos;m wondering if the mutilation of daughters, specifically their hands, is a common element in folk tales... ;I agree with some of the posts here suggesting that there is an element of budding sexuality/puberty at play in the girl&apos;s decision to go with the rabbit. Because of their excessive fertility, rabbits have long been used to represent a vital sex drive ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_and_hares_in_art ). However, the same vitality and passion that can make one an appealing sex partner can also sometimes fuel aggressive and temperamental behavior (his bullying of the girl). ;Interesting... I hadn&apos;t even thought about the symbolism of the cabbage patch before. I was too focused on the rabbit. :-) That ties a lot of these themes together very neatly right from from the start- if the rabbit represents the male and the cabbage patch represents the female, and the first thing we learn in the story is that the mother fears that rabbit is a danger to the cabbage patch... ;Taking a little inspiration from the Bride and Switch thread here, I also wanted to talk about a TvTrope I was reminded of when reading The Brother And Sister-  No Ontological Inertia http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia It references, among other things, the preponderance of stories that involve spells breaking once the original spellcaster is gone- ie the fawn becoming human again once the witch is executed. This is definitely not the first time I&apos;ve seen a fairy tale appeal to this rule of magic, and I was wondering why. Is it just a convenient plot device to secure a happy ending, or is there a deeper significance? Anyway, I just wanted to open the floor to opinions because I wasn&apos;t really sure myself... I did have a sort of fuzzy idea that it was related to religion in some way- there are lots of stories going back to the ancient world showing God/the gods putting constant effort into keeping the world running on a day to day basis (Apollo&apos;s daily chariot ride, for example)- and that maybe magic is supposed to work in a similar way to divine power. But I don&apos;t know. ;It wouldn&apos;t be the first time... In the Bible, Eve and Adam are punished for eating fruit that they have been told will make them like God. Arachne is punished for bragging that her weaving is better than the goddess Athena&apos;s even though a weaving contest between the two shows that this is actually true.  However, I wouldn&apos;t discount the greed angle entirely- looking to seize divine power could very well be read as the ultimate form of greed. Alternately, you could say that the story shows that material wealth and success can go to people&apos;s head and make them believe that they truly are/deserve to be like gods (there are many reak world examples throughout history of the rich and powerful behaving this way). ;</string>
            <string>Hi,I had no time to ask before, but the beginning is   good time to ask general questions, I think. I&apos;m wondering why the more-or-less-ten authors studied in this class are the ones who are studied. Everybody (I suppose) can add very famous authors in this list. Is it because the chosen authors wrote shorts stories and others do not ? Or is it because they are free to read ? Or something else ?I had been surprised too that nearly none of the authors are non-english speaking authors. There is only one, the Grimm brothers, and I don&apos;t deny their strenght but Maupassant, Goethe or Gogol are major authors in fantasy litterature, and I&apos;m sure there exist english versions from their stories.Thirdly, the list begins in XVIIIth century. I&apos;m very glad to see that Aesop is in the course&apos;s introduction, but why are the ten authors so late in history ? People had stories maybe from the beginning ot times : I think about Homer and ancient greeks, or mythology and gods all over the world. Is it to avoid speaking about gods ? Of course it could lead very far from litterature, but if we have an interest on fantasy, it may be an very decent start and I would like to understand why they are missing.Thank you for reading ! ;</string>
            <string>While I do think that the reading list is not an exhaustive one, I believe it attempts to have a well-rounded set of novels that include pivotal stories to the genre of fiction. Also, it is important to consider, as a prof, that the students do not have the same level of reading skills, understanding or rate of learning. In other words, we could be &quot;sitting&quot; next to a guy who writes sf novels for a living or next to a guy who is actually just trying to begin a more active reading lifestyle. Thus, this can make it a bit complex from the standpoint of the teachers (I am assuming).As for the works themselves, I believe ancient mythology and storytelling is quintessential to the well-versed mind of a fiction writer / reader, but there are several factors to consider. First of all, time. We can spend an entire decade studying fiction from the early beginnings of man to our modern era and we would not be even close to finishing. Secondly, because relatively &quot;modern&quot; tales and stories are more into context with our contemporary world. It is no easy task to have a full, in-depth analysis of Dracula which considers the psychological, sociological and cultural impact on western culture and writing. But it is something completely different to have this same analysis on a work like The Odyssey, where the context of Greek culture and history is basic to the understanding of the story. Therefore, relatively modern stories are more accessible (and I use this term loosely) from a contextual point of view.This is of course, just my wild guess on the selection of the tales for the course. ;1. Ringworld - Larry Niven2. Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein 3. Ender&apos;s Game - Orson Scott Card4. Hidden Empire - Kevin J. Anderson5. The Mysterious Stranger - Mark TwainAlso, I truly enjoyed 1984 and the mountains of madness by Orwell and Lovecraft respectively but they have already been named. ;</string>

            <string>Very interesting theme.I think &apos;golden bird&apos; in Grimm tales is borrowed from Russian tales - Slavic&apos;s tale. We have not &apos;golden bird&apos; - we have the Fire Bird. It&apos;s shining like a sun, but not burn. It&apos;s some kind of phoenix and it definitely is the simbol of the sun. But not the simbol of the richness directly.Story the tale of the brothers Grimm about golden bird is identical to the Russian tale about the Fire Bird. Only instead of a fox we have   wolf (and it is also a deep symbolism) )))About colors. Maybe someone would be interested. In Russian we have 2 color (two diferent) for English &apos;blue&apos;. Even in the rainbow, &apos;Sinij&apos; = blue, &apos;goluboj&apos; = light-blue, or sky-blue. The &apos;golubuj&apos; is a The Sky color, but The Sea is &apos;sinij&apos;. As far as I know, this blue-division is only in Russian language. And I don&apos;t know why. In Serbian lang there is &apos;plavi&apos; that means &apos;no-red&apos;. It may be blue - and it may be light-yellow. Blond-hair girl they call &apos;plavusha&apos;, and it may be means &apos;blue-haired&apos; girl also. This is (as I was hear) very old color system: white (purity), black (dirty or death), red (not white not black, but beautiful - &apos;red girl&apos; means &apos;beautiful girl&apos;) and &apos;not red, but not white and black&apos; - &apos;plavi&apos;, or blue. It&apos;s like &apos;The One&apos;, &apos;The One and its Opposite&apos;, &apos;The Three&apos; (white-black-red) and &apos;The Three plus something else&apos;.;In Russian tradition &quot;red&quot; means &quot;beautiful&quot;. Red girl, red square, red sun - even red death. Russian proverb: &quot;before your own folk even death is red&quot;. So &quot;red cap&quot; strongly correspond to &quot;beautiful  cap&quot;, or girl. Wolf in the Russian tradition is not just a symbol of &quot;sexual predator&quot;. Wolf is a simbol of wild evil,  man-eater, sometimes stupid, but not sexual. Something that must be killed in any case or its kill and devours you. Not simple kill, but break you into pieces. Wolf is the enemy, robber.In this simbols system, we have another view on this tale. The little  beautiful  girl (child) meets in the dark wild forest a men-eater...  stupid mother who sends her child in the dangerous forest all alone...  where for some unknown reason lives a grandma...The language of symbols should be clear for the people of this culture as the common language and if you use another simbol&apos;s system...So the view of professor&apos;s was very unexpected and funny for me. &quot;The Red Cap&quot; as a sexual thriller...But this view have some (many!) logic inside, and it  has the right to exist. In this system, everything becomes clear.Though  I think that some strories is not worth dig too deep :);</string>
            <string>I think these books is a roots of our modern fantasy. This is vary interesting!In &quot;Dracula&quot; I saw a lot of parallels with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, for example. Individual lines simply copied (though not simple - cleverly copied)!&quot;Alice&quot; is still read as a contemporary book and still not completely solved. All western modern fantasy &quot;follow the White Rabbit&quot;.All these books create a language of symbols, by wich modern writers is spoken. Western writers, I mean. Russian fantasy wolrd is a little different, we have some another roots. Some common, though.;Fist of all: I thing it must be read in English.This book was translated into Russian by many famous Russian writers (including A. P. Chekhov and V.V. Nabokov). Pesonaly I like the translation of B. Zakhoder and not like translation of Nabokov. Both of them not translated but trying re-tale &quot;Alice&quot;. But Zahoder in fact translate it, Nobokov re-tale. So Nabokov version is not Carrol book but Carrol and Nabokov, more Nabokov for my opinion.Zakhoder translated book after &quot;25 years of reading in English,&quot; and &quot;it was his favorite book&quot;. So his translation very good, very near to original by spirit. But not for language. Not so light, not so &quot;nonsenceless&quot; - not childish, though Zakhoder was the perfect children&apos;s writer (which I loved).I think it&apos;s impossible translate Carroll&apos;s books, like poetry (although   verses translated perfectly by S. Marshak).The English version lighter, brighter, more cheerful, more funny.Russian are usually afraid to read in the original, because even in translation a lot of new words. &quot;Read in English? No, not &quot;Alice&quot;! There, even Russian version make me dizzy!&quot;But read in English more lighter than Russian, I think.To read the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is much more difficult.;Sorry, by the way. There was very good audio-version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, on a vinyl-disk, with songs of V. Vysotsky. The spirit of this version is just like in original book, very close. But it is not translation and not a book. As a child, I was not very fond of the book (Russian translation), but this vinyl record was one of my favorites. I think many Russian people can say also.;I&apos;ve read some about vampires ...I used to think that vampires descent from western legends, Western Europe. German, may be, but certainly not the Slavic. Werewolfs is Slavic, true, that there is a lot proofs and explanations. Enough to say that the Byzantine chronicles the battle cry of the ancient Slavs was howling.We have some legends about &apos;vurdalak&apos;, this is some mixture vimpires and zombies, very nasty thing. But not vimpires (as I thought).But then I found out that vampires are purely Slavic legend, the Serbian. And that cases of vampirism documentary recorded in Western Serbia. In this year in Western Serbia was even declared a state of alarm, because  a one famous vampire, Sava Savanovi  , it woke up. The Serbs, as it says in Wikipedia, have inherited this legend from Iranian tribes.... or it may be Tatarian...In short, the ancestor of Count Dracula was an old evil witch who attacked the brave riders (Iranian or Tatarian) and bit them in the heel.   And through the heel sucking their blood so so that they could not ride (I do not really understand the connection between the heel and the ride)So if you want to escape from the vampires take care of heels greater than the neck. And do not trust women, just in case.;</string>

But I&apos;m interersting in the knowledges  of this course.I don&apos;t understand why the marks from peer are more important then this  knowledges.;Just a few thoughts. These thoughts came to me after reading &quot;Frankenshtain&quot;.The monster of Frankenshtein is like Golem. Frankenshtain studied the works of the famous alchemist - Agrippa etc. In the Alchemia was (and is) one strange simbol - the white hare. This is simbolic name for mercury.Mercury was one of the important component for production of the Philosopher&apos;s Stone. And alchemists usualy wrote some important recipes in allegory. This was the defence from a fools.So, the White Rabbit of Lewis Carroll... Alice grew up and shrunken down... Materials increases with heating and decreases with cooling...May be &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is a recipe for production of the Philosopher&apos;s Stone? May be Lewis Carroll got it?I think - yes! Yes, he got it! And after he got it he presented it to Alice!He was a photographer!&quot;White rabbit&quot; is a light. Rabbit hole is the diaphragm of camera. The image of Alice Alice went through the hole &quot;white rabbit&quot; and long time fall   (this was the ancient way of taking a photo). White rabbit has a clock... to keep track of how long it is necessary to fall. And the diaphragm turns the image, change the top and bottom.Further Alice (her image) increased (heated),   decreased (cooling), gone to the &quot;salt lake of tears&quot; with faitytales animals... That means with some chemical elements... The &quot;mouse&quot; is a name for arsenicum, for example. Russian name for arsenicum is a &quot;myshjak&quot;, mean &quot;mouse-er&quot;, is was used for kill mouses. Lewis Carroll was in Russia, made some photo there, he used to play with word and language...After &quot;solt lake&quot; Alice dried, pressed in white rabbit&apos;s house, sprinkled by &quot;pebbles&quot;... Photographic plate is ready for printing!For printing you must choose the right size (not large not small, the mushroom help)...Wait 5 hours impatiently (with March Hare)...By the way, &quot;Why is a raven like a writing-desk?&quot; They are both black in black-white photo. And, if you want make a good photo you must somehow divide its. May be eyes of real Alice was bronw? With black pupil of course.&quot;Painting roses&quot; means retouching, and, and after all procedures - the photo of Alice, at the end of the hand-written book, presented to her.May be she asked him how he makes photos? And he told her about it in a fairy tale&apos;s style, as for a child.;Why &quot;white rabbit&quot;?In the Alchemia &quot;white hare&quot; is a simbol for mercury - an element. &quot;Mercury&quot; is a God&apos;s name. Mercury God are The Spirit of the Alchemia, the main spirit and the Teacher for all alchemists - Mercurius ter Maximus. The Light is a main part, The Spirit of photos. Making photos means &quot;drowing by only light&quot;. So The Light, the &quot;white rabbit&quot;, for photograhers equals Mercury for alchemists.;But raven may be white, too ))If you&apos;re trying to make picture from photoplate you must be very accurately with time and chemicals reagents. If you make a mistake a similar colors (in black-white case) will be seen equal. Brown and black will be seen like black, or like gray. It you trying to make photo-portrait you should pay special attention to the eyes. If eyes are dark (brown) to make its &quot;live&quot; on picture a very difficult task. Especially in those days.So, if you want to solve this problem... What can you do, how can you do? How can you split these colors? Brown like color of writing-desk, black like color of raven... Why is a raven like a writing-desk? Where is the error in the process?;Google translated badly.  ;What do you think, whether Victor had the right to kill the monster? The monster was a living intelligent being, quite human. The right from a Christian point of view, I mean.;agreed;The Science is a rationality. Destroing the result of a successful experiment...;</string>
            <string>In one novel writen by very famous and very good russian science fiction authors (two brothers) is a story: the evolution of man leads to the emergence of a new, post-human kind. People of a new humanity recognize each other by some tests. One of the test is a attitude to some scary-looking but harmless monsters. &quot;New people&quot; don&apos;t afraid its and trying to help these creations. &quot;Old people&quot; are panicking. The &quot;new people&quot; is named as &quot;ludens&quot;, or &quot;homo ludens&quot;.Some years ago I had read one &quot;scientific&quot; article (of course not from these two authors!). In this article was the thesis: modern americans science fiction authors - Bradbury, Shekly, Norton, Simak, Asimov etc. is (or was) such &quot;new people&quot;, &quot;ludens&quot;.This is funny, but I think here is the some truth. From Russia in this list must be included br. Strugatskie (A. and B.), I. Efremof, K. Bulychev...Surely - S. Lem from Poland.So... The Frankenstain&apos;s Monster as tester of new humanity ))));&quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;.In Russia we have a very similar tale, even a many tales. &quot;The Stone Flower&quot; most famous (book, cinema, ballet, necessary story for the children&apos;s reading - VERY famous).The story about young man who has tried to make the flower from malachite.   Really live flower, or near to it. The Art, the live art. He became obsessed with this idea, gave out his bride (at the their wedding), his family, his work... and gone into the Mountain to the mountain spirit, The Missis of The Mountain.But his fiancee had saved him from the Mountain after some years, and inside the mountain he had made the flower. And The Missis of The Mountain gave them some presents (though there was a strong rivalry between she and his fiancee).Stories like but a meanings are completely different. And the moral is differentFor me &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot; is like a Prince from Cinderella was married on one of stepmother daughter (the nastiest) and Cinderella herself was washing dishes on their wedding.;</string>
            <string>The word &quot;master&quot; in Russian means different from English. Russian &quot;Master&quot; not means &quot;House-holder&quot; or holder something, or Lord, or boss. Russian &quot;master&quot; means &quot;very skillful craftsman&quot;, or craftsman, whose craft became the art.These was (pity but not &quot;is&quot;, hope that &quot;will&quot;) very famous and respectful people. We can said even about &quot;cult of master&quot; in Russian - in the Russain Impire and USSR both, informal and implicit, though.There is a old russian proverb: &quot;he is a master from God&quot;. So &quot;master&quot; is a man whose hands the God managing Himself. Master can, must and do the miracles. This is his function. Craft-miracles, I mean.Master is not saint, not even religious. But he has inspiration from God, inside him there is the God&apos;s spirit of creation. He may be bad after the act of creation (even very bad), but not in process. In the process of creation he have God&apos;s spirit. If that master trying repeat the Nature or even exceed the Nature - Nature itsef helps him (by nature spirits like the Missis of The Copper   Mountain in &quot;The Stone Flower&quot;).   But he may be strange. Actually, then he have some inspiration, he must be strange. Other people can misunderstand he but only as long as he will show them the result.So, the Owen Warland was a real master. He was strange, he definitely had inspiration, he was very skillful craftsman and he was trying to make a miracle. And he done it. But nobody helps him, he lost his life, lost his love and his miracle was crushed. That means (from me) the other people was monsters. They was totally blind, and even the child could not feel the God Spirit in this miracle.There is another think. If craftsman is a master the God is behind his shoulder. That means: if he is a REAL master, all his doings have God&apos;s inspiration - that is Life, or Spirit. The Frankenstain&apos;s monster have a live - he was a God&apos;s creation, God&apos;s miracle. If a master is selfish, or money-lover, or etc his creation can&apos;t be live. It can&apos;t be the art even. It can&apos;t have God inside. If you &quot;have the God is behind your shoulder&quot; then you are doing something - this something must have the spirit, or live. Then it have the spirirt - it is not your creation, it is the miracle for all people, even for you. The fact you done it means you CAN have God&apos;s inspiration, but not have it all times. If you are proud you done it and make it live yourself you are very stupid - but you can have this inspiration anything. And people known about you can have.This is the moral. This is a not main russian archetype, it is not official but is deep and folk. Now, in our time, the &quot;cult of master&quot; sounds like non-fanny joke.   But it is there, as archetype. ;http://www.amazon.com/Malachite-Casket-Tales-Pavel-Bazhov/dp/1589637313/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373541192&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bazhov   - book in Amazonhttp://lastochka-fromrussiawithlove.blogspot.ru/2009/03/tales-of-malachite-casket-hostess-of.html - this is that story (not sure is a good translate)http://www.4to40.com/folktales/index.asp?p=The_Malachite_Casket - the extensionThis is not a fairy tales. It was not &quot;once upon a time&quot;, these stories about lived 100-200 years ago people, this is fiction, folk fantasy. This is NOT like br. Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales.Bazhov can hear about Hawthorne. Can, but I don&apos;t know had hear or not. I think not.Bazhov wrote folk tales, there was MANY such tales, about craft-masters, from all Russia, not only from Ural region.;&quot;The Satyr-man looked curiously at me.    The Third with the Whip, he that walks weeping into the sea, has a thin white face.       He has a thin long whip,    said Montgomery.    Yesterday he bled and wept,    said the Satyr.    You never bleed nor weep. The Master does not bleed or weep.   &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;You can not translate this &quot;Master&quot; to Russian by word &quot;master&quot;. Next meaning in Russian for &quot;master&quot; after &quot;skillfull craftsman&quot; is a &quot;teacher&quot;.We have slang (professional) word &quot;Master&quot; for the Captain of a merchant ship, I think it is directly connect to English meaning of word &quot;master&quot;, maybe this is direct translate from English. Maybe the meaning &quot;master=boss&quot; come from here, from &quot;captain&quot;. ;yes.http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%E0%EC%E5%ED%ED%FB%E9_%F6%E2%E5%F2%EE%EA_%28%E1%E0%EB%E5%F2%29 - ballet (http://www.allmusic.com/composition/the-tale-of-the-stone-flower-ballet-op-118-mc0002389758)http://www.ivi.ru/watch/54863 - cinema online on RussianTale in English - http://russian-crafts.com/tales/stone_flower.html (very short re-tale)And this is a tale one from many.

But , answering the line about Propp , I can say  it is a  Great reading. Very logical , clear and interesting theory. I was lucky to read it as  a teenager and since  I see  a literature different. Sorry for my English , ;I prefer to read book itself to see the logic and explanations. On  unnderstanding rituals I like and recommend&quot; The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion by James George Frazer&quot; ;I am sorry for interruptions , but back to Propp . The name of one of the works is &quot; Historical roots of the fairytale&quot; it is giving the base to see and interpret all symbols and structure as a complex not separately , and you really can see time levels. .  You can look at this as at the history of the human nature and mind , and that is why just a list of some findings not enriching us at all. The problem is WHY we are still repeating this patterns.And, yes the answer: it is all about ancient rituals. As a Halloween. Memory of  the childhood of the Society.  ;I will not say I have studied Propp. I just read few of his books when I was 12-13 years old an this was a long time ago. But 3 of his main works are very interesting : Morphology of the Fairytale, Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale and Ritual Laughter in the Folklore.( translation of the titles mine, mean  :not good). In the first work he is brilliantly analyzing the structure of the fairytale, on second scrupulously showing connections between every detail of the fairytale and details of the initiation ritual and in the third bringing a new idea of the sacred laughter.          I am not very good with Internet search and I did not find second and third books in English translation, but the first, &quot; Morphology&quot; looks popular enough . P. S.  And in the  Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale , Propp working a lot of with Frazer&apos; s materials.  P.P.S. And all Propp&apos;s work is a real science , not just emotions and guessing. ;I like how both of you finding  ideas ,you really can see a gap to fill up : 100 years and a very impressive character who&apos;s origins are absolute mystery . Us for me a Blue Beard sound as a contemporary composition about a serial killer.(  Just joking). ;According to  Propp it will be not FROM the Garden of Eden but TO the Garden of Eden,   and the hole will be associated with grave- entrance to the other world.            All Alice pattern repeating classic  preCristian stories, which in its own turn repeating the pattern of the initiation rituals( think Grim&apos;s Mother Snowbed: Fall in a well and instead dying finding the magic land , traveling there, meeting supernatural characters and returning back to the earth more strong , more rich or even with some extra power. )          But each new time level adding a new meaning to the old pattern.  ( As Professor Rabkin pointing on association with Garden of Eden, not The Land of Ancestors).           All of this repetitions  unintentional , just using century proved powerful structure to deliver own ideas to the audience. It is just an old  good carriage for the new fruits. If Greg will use the same pattern for his work ,it does not mean he want to convince  his young readers to believe in a power of spirits, just people always will eat  familiar food, better than green eggs and hem.             And Propp just work as an archeologist in literature , not as a critic. One more time ,sorry for my English . ;</string>
            <string>;I believe so.for this reason I&apos;m playing with word clouds (created by Wordle) iot get the general idea before starting to write.here&apos;s another...;actually word cloud apps use a frequency counter for word selection and sizing, but the literary interpretation is interesting   !;In the first one,I used as an input all the text from the book and the app picked the most frequent words.

            <string>It is very hard for me to read stories (literature ooohhh) but I will.........I am starting The War of Worlds.;Its great chance for me to review others&apos; work. I am learning from this so much.   ;Getting chance to learn how to read, write and review,,,,;</string>
            <string>The Master and Margarita is an epic book. I&apos;ve read it 3 or 4 times, the first time when I was 8-9. Every time I find something different in this story and I guess, next time I&apos;ll read it, it&apos;d be completely different again.;I think that we can add to white - red - black as dawn - noon - night a circle of life.Morning was/is seen as the beginning of life, day is a life itself, while night is a symbol of death/the end. Since humanbeings have been always afraid of death and it seemed for them as something mysterious, fatal and thus evil(from here comes the everlasting desire of immortality and, maybe, Christian interpretation of immortality of soul as well as older versions of reincarnation and afterlife) - black began to be &quot;bad&quot; color, while white, beginning of life - purity - hope, as a &quot;good&quot; color.  Although, red color can be inserted into this logic(red - day - life - giving new life), I don&apos;t think that it has so much to do with noon in a subconsious. Rather, I guess, it&apos;s again about feminine power and giving the new life.;There&apos;s a tool -  http://accredible.com/  that lets you create Certs for a class to &quot;show the world what you know&quot; and save all your knowledge in one place.I&apos;ve been using it for some time and found it very beneficial.Saving notes. As you may know, most of Coursera courses close access to materials, including assignments, after the class is over. That&apos;s really sad, especially, for courses that are not just quiz-based. In this class, we&apos;ll have a lot of written assignments and losing them will not be awesome.Motivation. I noticed that once I create Cert, I feel that I need to work much harder on course because my friends, family will see the results of my work. So, it&apos;s not just about me and certificate after the class. It&apos;s about putting a lot of effort to have something substantial to show off later. Thus, much more thorough learning happens during the course.Here&apos;s example of my Cert for Developing Innovative Ideas:  https://www.accredible.com/570.  Promotion note - I  would love if you endorse :)I&apos;m definitely going to use it for this class. Anyone else in?PS Because I&apos;m an &quot;old&quot; user, I can give you some advices on Cert and share experience. Feel free to ask :)Best wishes,Roxy.;I remember that in childhood Grimm&apos;s tales were not my favourite(Anderson&apos;s were), but still these stories excited imagination and I was allured to them. However, the tales I read were not as dark as original versions we read now but no were they soft, innocence adaptations for children. What do I think for these dark stories with witches, ravens, blood, death being introduced to children?I think, fairy tales today have two main purposes:introducing kids to the world in a illustrative, exciting manner and teaching the first lessons/morals;enrich imagination and entertain;When it comes to the first purpose, dark stories may not be perfect but still they are much better than naive adaptations in that - the world is not perfect and it will never be, children may experience some inner problems that they won&apos;t be aware of or ready to talk to adults. Dark stories help kids a) to realize that world is not always fair in an illustrative, playful manner; b) cope with stresses, problems they won&apos;t discuss with adults. Yes, definitely, there should be trust between kid and parent but sometimes it&apos;s not achievable.Personal example: I had very tough childhood with parents being divorced and me living with neither of them, feeling outsider at kindergarten and school(since all of my peers had families). Two fairy tale stories that helped me to &quot;survive&quot; this time and most likely mitigate the psychological trauma were not happy adaptations of originals, even though they were not dark:  Ugly Duckling  by Christian Andersen and I don&apos;t remember the second except plot(girl had a chance to choose whether she would be poor and miserable and suffer in the beginning of life but live good life later or vice verse). As a kid, I used main characters as &quot;role models&quot; and since both of them had happy ends, &quot;surviving&quot; was much easier.  I can&apos;t say so much onto the second point. I guess, eliminating all the darkness from the stories will do more harm than good because darkness is an important part of human nature as well as it&apos;s alluring for all the ages. Maybe, it&apos;s just part of who we are. Maybe, kids need to face and be aware of these dark moments to fight the further fears as the heroes of fairy tales. However, I believe that original stories like we had this week are not suitable for kids. It&apos;s all about golden mean.;Peer-reviews enhance one&apos;s learning. That&apos;s a fact. But self-assessment after the peer-reviews can help to make one&apos;s works better because after seeing other&apos;s mistakes or perfect works, a person can give her/himself a good feedback, seeing the own work with a new perspective.This course is awesome, and the only one that seems to be missing is the ability to self-assess yourself after peer-evaluation. It might be of a great help for better learning.Is there any opportunity to make it happen?;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t think that our own grades should be counted towards the final grade, but it can be as part of assignement.  I&apos;ve taken some courses at Coursera, like Human Computer Interaction, with self-assessment. I can&apos;t say that I was so impressed with it, but I noticed that this part is really helpful only when I took this class without self-assessment.  ;Definitely, self-reflection is a crucial part of learning. I can&apos;t say that anything stops me from reflecting on my work and feedback.  I think, the option of &quot;self-assess&quot; your own work gives completely different experience from self-reflection. After reading and evaluating other&apos;s works, you see your piece not as your own. It&apos;s something like changing the roles of student and teacher. Some people can do this without system, but for others enter this mood for own work might be difficult. The purpose of the course is not to get a good grade, but to learn. I believe that this option could enhance one&apos;s learning.Besides, not everyone takes time to do self-assessment on his/her own. The required self-assessment would be a motivation in order to complete the course.;I was wonering - are there any teens taking this course? So far it seems to be that youth is underpresented in forums. Still, I hope to find some people of my age(15-22).My name is Roxy (for Enlgish-speaking world), I&apos;m 19 and self-directed learner from Russia. I&apos;m really passionate about entrepreneurship, business, edtech.Why this course? First of all, my plan of study was too &quot;business&quot; -- I wanted to take a break from it and find an inspiration in another areas. Secondly, I&apos;ve always loved reading and writing. When it comes to writing - I have enough of it in my life: blogging, keeping journal, writing short personal essays. But fiction reading was absent because &quot;I don&apos;t have enough time&quot;. Now, when I&apos;m taking this course, I&apos;m very happy &quot;to have a permission to read&quot; as much as I want.  So, it&apos;s a few words about myself.

I graded only one essay with 4, others are 5 and 6.;Thank you. Yes, I do look forward to read further books. I&apos;m very excited about Dracula and Frankenstein is one of my favourite(so, essay is almost ready already, I hope it&apos;s not considered as cheating).I can&apos;t say anything about my objectivity - I used a thesis that popped out the first in my head.

            <string>This poem has been very special for me since childhood. When I was reading Frankenstein for the first time, I recalled it in almost every chapter. So, I want to share it with you.The Ugly GirlAmong the other children playing,She reminds me of a little frog.Her skimpy blouse is tucked into her knickers;Her gingery curls tumble in disarrayWide mouth her teeth uneven,,Her features harsh and uglyThe two little boys her own age,Have been bought a bike each by their dads,Today they&apos;re in no hurry for their lunch;Oblivious of her they hare about the yard,She runs behind them trying to keep up.Their happiness she experiencesAs her own, her aching heart explodesWith it and the girl shouts and laughsWith the sheer delight of living.Of envy or malice, this little creatureKnows nothing yet. Everything for herIs so immeasurably new, everythingIs so alive that&apos;s dead for others!And as I look at her, I try  Not to think the day will come when sheWill realise with horror, sobbing, thatShe is nothing but a poor plain little thing!I&apos;d like to think the heart&apos;s no playthingTo be broken in an instant just like that!I&apos;d like to think that the flameBurning brightly deep within herWill of it&apos;s own vanquish this painAnd melt the hardest stone!Her features may possess no beauty,Nothing to stir the imagination withStill a youthful grace alreadyInforms her every movement.And this being so, what&apos;s beauty then,And why do men idolise it?Is it a vessel containing nothing,Or a fire burning brightly in that vessel?Nikolai ZabolotskyTranslated by Daniel Weissbort;</string>
            <string>HiI am new to this course and was wondering what exactly to add into the works cited column in the assignment? Please help.Regards,Avinash;Thanks Amber. Appreciate your help. Peace.;Hi Everyone,I have some doubts regarding how many stories to read from the Lucy Crane translation.http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htmIt has been posted in the &quot;announcement&quot; section  that a student asked a similar question and it was replied that the answer is in the course syllabus page. Now the course syllabus page says:&quot;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg.&quot;As you can see from the above link, there are many stories inside that particular translation. Do we read all? Please help.Regards,Avinash Baruah;Can it be also be the pain of taking away something which people are attached to. Like the cabbage being taken away by the rabbit and the bride (in the form of straw model) also being taken away in the end?;Thanks Jae;</string>
            <string>The Dresden files incorporate a lot of mythic creatures so would be a good intro with   the Grimm book. Book 1-2 are very slow, book 3 is where the series takes off, book 4 introduces fairies into the series along some more mythology.;I think part of it is when you were traveling back then and were meeting people, you needed a letter of introduction to be welcome in the place. I remember of my lit teachers telling me this sort of served as a &quot;back ground check&quot; since you were letting an unknown person enter your town or home. It was very rare to travel unless you were a person of means or you were a trader/soldier/goverment employee.;If you have read the Dresden files by Jim Butcher, the novel Dracula was put out as a manual for members of the general public on how to recognize and kill members of the Black Court. Members of the Black Court are blood drinkers. Jim gives references to the White Court, incubi and succubi, and the Red Court, also blood drinkers. JIm briefly mentions the Jade Court, based somewhere in Asia, but only mentions they are very secretive. What do you think they Jade Court resembles.;</string>
            <string>These are excellent examples. I would also like to add &quot;Houston, Houston Do You Read?&quot; by James T. Tiptree Jr. (pen name of Alice Sheldon). It&apos;s short!;</string>
            <string>I just picked Egalia&apos;s Daughters up unconsciously at the library (it was near to &quot;The Axe&quot; by Sigrid Undset, looked interesting). I&apos;m so surprised to see it here and now I&apos;m excited to read it.My five would be-#1. The short stories by Jorge Luis Borges that count.#2. Titus Groan / Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake#3. Berserk by  Kentaro Miura#4. The Earthsea Trilogy by Ursula K. Le Guin#5. A Canticle for Leibowitz by  Walter M. Miller Jr.;</string>
            <string>Your word count is too low. Also short story titles have to be set out from the paragraph in some way, either italicize them or put them in quotes.  I also can&apos;t find a single thesis. Lack of realism, exaggeration, brevity, and darkness are all separate comments you haven&apos;t integrated. I suggest next time pick one idea, such as lack of realism, then provide multiple examples to make your argument stronger. Maybe you could have found more examples of lack of realism besides the animals and exaggeration instead of going off onto other ideas, or you could have discussed more than one story.Finally, I don&apos;t buy that Grimm&apos;s fairy tales are less realistic than modern stories, and why is it their lack of realism that makes them similar to folk tales? They are folk tales, and since we weren&apos;t assigned other folk tales to read you have to explain this idea.Sorry for being so critical, I&apos;m only trying to help.;Interesting essay, but why just  The Death of the Hen? You could have easily written about all of the  Hen/Cock stories in the anthology. It would have been harder to put into 300 words, but it would have convinced me you read all of Grimm and not just  The Death of the Hen, and it would have been a stronger argument. Perhaps my history of &quot;prove you read the work&quot; humanities assignments is showing through though.Interesting comment about how in Grimm&apos;s  fairytales some objects are inanimate  and others are not. I remember in  The White Snake how the  servant was perfectly willing to sacrifice his horse to feed the ravens. Didn&apos;t the horse protest?;Your essay was very interesting to read, and took some thinking about. As Martha says, paragraphs and white space would help. 300 words is a short paragraph in a longer work, but in a shorter work like this multiple paragraphs make it more aesthetically pleasing. You should also cite Gibert Durand, and remove the contractions. Finally there are some awkward places with poor grammar. (&quot;According to&quot;, not  &quot;In according to&quot;;  &quot;might be understood,&quot; not &quot;might be understanding.&quot;  Enough with the criticisms on writing style though, your content is powerful. I feel I understand the story on such a deeper level after reading your essay. Dual symbolism is an interesting tool, and I think your choices really hit the meaning beyond the story. Thank you for posting.  I do wonder about the clock though. What does the dual symbolism  of maternity and death say about how the only surviving gosling hides in a clock? Does the time represent death, or is the clock another womb symbol, where the gosling is released alive to its mother when time is up? Why does the wolf fail to look in the clock?;Thank you for the elaboration. Symbolism is immensely fascinating, and so many people don&apos;t understand how it works beneath the surface to influence a reader&apos;s thoughts.I&apos;m just realizing I made a mistake when I corrected your grammar. Your sentence should read &quot;dark symbols might be understood as the faces of death when negatively valued.&quot; I&apos;m sorry if what I said before was confusing, I wasn&apos;t thinking.;Hmm... Perfectly good essay (again, I&apos;m not trying to come off as mean, it&apos;s a good essay), but at first I wasn&apos;t convinced and had to think it through myself before I came to your conclusion. I think your argument works better for Aesop&apos;s fables than Grimm&apos;s fairy tales. I&apos;m also not sure about your moral for The Rabbit&apos;s Bride. The theme that all things have their proper duty and place is very prevalent in Grimm&apos;s tales. Maybe the reader is supposed to laugh at the stupid rabbit who thinks he can marry a maiden and have her work for him in his rabbit hutch. The same in  The Death of the Hen. I was kind of distressed at the morbidity of  the story, but it&apos;s possible historical readers laughed at the ridiculousness of a cock morning a hen in a human fashion.  I really do think the warning in both of the stories is to not step out of one&apos;s place.  You imply in your first sentence that all Grimm&apos;s fairy tails have  animal characters. We all know what you mean, but be careful about what your words actually say.  ;Hello Kathryn. Great essay. I know you&apos;re limited by the word count, but as your essay is on children in forests, I think it would have been useful to contrast it with adults/animals in forests. I think much of the fear and darkness Grimm has for children in forests is missing in the tales about adults/animals and that would have really strengthened your thesis. Also, I was struck in Red Cap about how the path was an area of safety, it&apos;s only when she strays that the girl is in danger.On the writing, I&apos;m not sure why you have single words in quotes.  ;Roberto, you said you were concerned, but your English reads like a native speaker&apos;s to me and I&apos;m not sure how peer 2 could tell English was your second language. The few errors didn&apos;t jump out to me the first time I read your essay and I think it takes a close reading to see them. And even then they read more like typos than then misconceptions about English. This might have worked against you if I graded your essay though, since I&apos;m inclined to be lenient towards people with English as a second language, but not so much with native speakers.  ;Yes, It is a big deal. In an academic setting plagiarism is taken very seriously. If you get the book thrown at you, an act of plagiarism can get you kicked out of college or ruin your carrier. Even if plagiarizing here isn&apos;t linked to repercussions, the mindset makes it a big deal. Andrew is right to be disgusted and the peer reviewer should be ashamed of themselves for their baseless accusations. ;Ah, thanks for the clarification. Plagiarism is a rather touchy subject with me, and I just don&apos;t separate the seriousness of plagiarism with the seriousness of an accusation so broadly. As plagiarism is a big deal, I find an accusation a big deal. In this case the peer reviewer assumed guilty with little evidence, and it&apos;s unlikely they&apos;ll learn because there is no communicating back to them unless they read the forums. The entire situation is just unfortunate. ;I tend not to notice the person, I just read, so it baffled me the first time I heard people had a preference. Both are good, but I suppose I love stream of consciousness so much I&apos;d have to pick 1st. If you&apos;re disconcerted by a writing style, I really suggest you just plod through it until it loses the discord.  Anyone like 2nd person? If on a Winter&apos;s Night a Traveler, Aura, Choose Your Own Adventures?Any love for 3rd person limited? For Whom the Bell Tolls is the famous example.And what about present tense?;(I tried to fix the grammar with the least amount of changes, sorry if that was  presumptuous)Once upon a time in a land called Coursera, a land of knowledge, wisdom, and assignments, where one could get lost and never find their way out, there was an old myth, telling that one could get out of Coursera&apos;s labyrinth if each town had a countdown clock to its destruction date. Distance did not exist at Coursera, anybody could broadcast texts and images for the whole town. However, even after much discussion, the course leaders could not agree on a date of destruction. So they...;Quoting the professor- &quot;We are a community. In our community, the readings, my videos, and your postings may be considered &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Their contents do not require citation in this course. But if you want to bring in more material, you&apos;re very welcome. Sharing is good.&quot;  I suggest that people be very wary of marking down for &quot;outside ideas&quot; without citations. There is a mixture of people in this class, and people have different standards for what something is that everyone knows. Something that seems a lifted idea may actually be something everyone knows for a different group of people. There are English professors among us. Although if they say something like &quot;I read once....,&quot; or &quot;so-and-so said...,&quot; then that does need a citation.  ;Brett, you should go to the store and get some orange marmalade right now. Then make toast. Or you could make kolaches. If you can&apos;t buy it, it&apos;s fairly easy to make from oranges.  Maybe that day by the lake Carroll and the three girls had orange marmalade and ran out? I can&apos;t think of anything it would symbolize, and according to the annotated Alice it&apos;s taking the jar down and putting it back that&apos;s the joke.  ;I haven&apos;t watched the lecture yet, and so I can&apos;t be sure about the professor&apos;s meaning, but even the children&apos;s works you list   (Nancy Drew and Encyclopedia Brown)  are episodic. They just divide the episodes into many short volumes. Tons of books for small children use this format (Cam Jansen, Babysitter&apos;s Club, Animorphs, etc...). It&apos;s also so commonly seen in cartoons (ex. Teletubbies, Scooby Doo, Power Rangers, etc.) that I can only think of a few examples of cartoons for children that don&apos;t use the &quot;pearl necklace&quot; technique.  Edit- Actually, Animorphs was a poor example. I&apos;ll replace that with Amelia Bedelia.;I&apos;ll get back to you after I&apos;ve watched the lectures.;</string>
            <string>I got one really good peer reviewer (with really good suggestions), but the majority of my reviewers didn&apos;t even bother to write the minimum 30 words. Shame on them. I wish people would show more integrity, just because the peer reviews aren&apos;t graded doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s acceptable to not follow the instructions. ;I&apos;m always surprised that people are so quick to say old texts are  don&apos;t stereotype. I feel it is reasonable to assume authors share the viewpoints of their age, and although England had at least abolished slavery by the time Dracula was written, it was a very racist age. If Bram Stoker did not have any racist beliefs, then he was very odd for his time.  I&apos;m not very far into Dracula (I&apos;ve read it before though), but it does have this sentence, &quot;The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist.&quot; I suppose we can interpret this as Bram Stoker writing a stereotyping Jonathan Harker, but I feel that is less likely than the simpler answer that Bram Stoker simply believed such things.;It&apos;s because Dracula is set in England and I&apos;m uneducated about Bram Stoker. He did seem to spend much of his life in London though. ;I haven&apos;t finished the text yet and I&apos;m fairly unwilling to go through it thinking about stereotypes, but stereotypical sections have been brought up. These sections have been explained away using the complicated explanation that Bram Stoker knew the stereotypes were inaccurate, but included them anyway because his character would not. The simpler explanation that Bram Stoker, a member of a very racist age, held these beliefs seems more likely to me. I don&apos;t think that idea that Bram Stoker was using them for effect because his readers find foreign people spooky changes this. I&apos;m also not sure what his being Irish and thus a victim of racism has anything to do with it.  Jason, I don&apos;t understand your argument. Trying not to interpret the work through today&apos;s modern lens is exactly what I&apos;m trying to do.  If I assume it&apos;s not stereotypical because modern people know stereotyping is bad, then I&apos;m making that mistake. If read as a modern text, I don&apos;t think Dracula comes off as racist at all.  It&apos;s only because I know the history (pretty poorly, though, if I get quizzed on actual beliefs I&apos;ll fail), that I find stereotypes.  It&apos;s not really judging, more recognition.  Please don&apos;t let this argument get nasty, it&apos;s only interesting to talk about only as long as it doesn&apos;t. There is no tone on the internet, if I come across as abrupt or nasty I do not mean it. To sum up my argument, I put the burden of proof on the &quot;not stereotyping&quot; side for older texts.  ;Yes, I am stereotyping. It&apos;s interesting to think of stereotyping in that sense. Discussion of an author using their own  cultural and historical background as an explanation for their work is  commonplace. I do not feel discussion of racism is irrelevant or  that discrimination is a trite issue. If you really think that I don&apos;t  think we have much else to say to each other. While I didn&apos;t want to be  rude by ignoring someone who addressed me personally, I&apos;d rather just  stop it here.;Finally got around to watching the lecture. From Greg&apos;s description I missed the part where the book can have an overall plot, and so I was wrong to say Animorphs wasn&apos;t an example. Animorphs is a perfect example. Although there is an overall plot of the kids (teenagers?) fighting the Aliens, each book has its own contained adventure, just like a pearl on a string. With a bit of editing, many of the contained adventures could be swapped around.I also still kind of consider the Encyclopedia Brown books an example. I&apos;m trying really hard not to be stubborn, but the order of the chapters in Encyclopedia Brown isn&apos;t important. In the beginning of each book Encyclopedia Brown is introduced, and then each mystery is its own pearl, although in Encyclopedia Brown the string is almost nonexistent. Encyclopedia Brown stories also do have &quot;unnecessary&quot; details, they characters introduced and objects focused on as red herrings to make the mystery less obvious. I&apos;d have to look at the stories, but I&apos;d bet sometimes those things are in sets of three. They accomplish the same thing as a character randomly looking at a flower, they make the story more interesting.However, although I&apos;m inclined to agree with the professor, none of this applies specifically to children&apos;s books. It just happens that the pearl of a string metaphor is perfect for series. Does anyone think  Don Quixote or Gulliver&apos;s travels might be good example of pearl on a string?;There&apos;s a difference between the peer-reviewer having a different opinion from the essayist, and the essayist just being blatantly wrong. It depends on how the essay is written. Do the essays add something to the knowledge? I&apos;d give a high grade to an essay that explained why certain details taken as symbolic are not, but arguing that Alice has no parodies is just poor comprehension.I gave my required 1 to one of the Alice-haters. They weren&apos;t arguing for no meaning (I&apos;m not sure what they were arguing for), but their essay showed poor comprehension of the work and of the terms they used. It was also written in that hidden 1st person where all the &quot;I&apos;s&quot; are replaced with &quot;the reader,&quot; and it was assumed &quot;the reader&quot; loses patience with Alice as the work goes on.  ;I understand this. The essay I read came off as jarring because the author attributed very personal reactions to &quot;the reader.&quot; If they had said &quot;some readers,&quot; or &quot;a reader&quot; I wouldn&apos;t have even noticed it.Edit- Again, everything depends on how the individual essay is written.  ;The difference between in-text references and citations isn&apos;t clear   to the uninitiated. Although I certainly want to include citations in my own work, I think it&apos;s unfair to mark down others for not citing when the instructions said we did not have to.  Can anyone explain to me how MLA in-text citations work for ebooks? I&apos;m more familiar with APA, which doesn&apos;t use page numbers, but APA seems inappropriate for this class. It&apos;s an ebook&apos;s lack of page numbers that&apos;s throwing me off. And could you possibly use Dracula as an example? Would something like this be fine?Dracula begins with Jonathan Harker&apos;s journey into Transylvania  (chapter 1).  ;Good website.  I&apos;ll post  the  answer  here  if  anyone  else is  unclear.  &quot; 22. Web site or other electronic source Your  in-text citation for an electronic source should follow the same  guidelines as for other sources. If the source lacks                   page numbers but has numbered paragraphs, sections, or  divisions, use those numbers with the appropriate abbreviation in your                   in-text citation:    par.,       sec.,       ch.,       pt.,    and so  on. Do not add such numbers if the source itself does not use them.                   In that case, simply give the author or title in your  in-text citation.                Julian Hawthorne points out profound differences between his father and Ralph Waldo Emerson but concludes that, in their lives                      and their writing,    together they met the needs of nearly all that is worthy in human nature    (ch. 4).&quot;http://bcs.bedfordstmartins.com/resdoc5e/RES5e_ch08_s1-0001.html;Both of your quotes are wrong. I had the actual quotes typed out for you, but I accidentally backspaced and lost them. Be more careful about this in the future.  Also, two of your peers suggested you explain the terminology more. I&apos;d be very wary about this, because if you explain things your peers know you will be marked down for wasting space. It&apos;s a delicate balance. Your topic was very interesting, but perhaps it&apos;s better to avoid this conundrum and be more focused on the work.  ;The free Amazon edition has done you a disservice then, you&apos;ve been reading a version riddled with errors.

Your essay was certainly one of the best ones I read and far better than my own.;I hope reading examples of great peer reviews will help us write better ones. I don&apos;t agree with everything this person says, but they have good points and reading their review helped me look at my own work more clearly. It&apos;s clear they read my essay, and they care enough to give my specific grammar mistake. My next essay will have citations and a stronger conclusion.Peer #2-Form: The essay is clearly written with only one minor error in grammar,  spelling or usage (&quot;The Queens &quot;frown,&quot; &quot;moan,&quot; and wring hands.&quot; - does  this mean more than one Queen or were you intending something  different?). I wouldn&apos;t consider the entry in the Works cited was  required as you did not quote from the discussion either directly or  indirectly.Content: An interesting aspect to pick up on. I could have lived without the  chunks of composition theory about  limited-view or omniscient narrators  and the description of dramatic irony. They seemed like padding which  is hardly needed in a three hundred word essay. I&apos;m almost tempted to  ask why there isn&apos;t a citation for your source on narrative devices.  A clear thesis was stated and some relevant examples shown. These could  have been stronger. There is really no conclusion and a very weak end to  the essay as it just seemed to rubn out of space or energy.  If I were able to award 1.5 I would do so but I can&apos;t so you just squeak  a 2.;Thank you for this. My writing isn&apos;t good enough and I need plenty of suggestions. These are my contributions.Rebecca and Sean have posted in this thread.  Expand upon, don&apos;t describe. Examples must be clear, but peer reviewers have all read the work. If you spend a paragraph describing exactly what happened in the book, that doesn&apos;t add to our knowledge.  A sentence is not a paragraph.  The oft-abandoned rule is 3 sentences. It just reads and looks better.  No more than a couple quotes.  Too many and the quotes take over your own writing.And these are suggestions to game the system:Have a extremely clear one sentence thesis.  Reviewers have latched onto  this as  a requirement.Don&apos;t repeat vocabulary or use a lot of -ly adjectives.  Reviewers have latched onto this as bad writing.   No tangents, no matter how interesting what you have to say is.  Resist the urge and post in the forums instead. Everything must be centered around the thesis. Everything.  ;By &quot;oft-abandoned&quot; I did mean often abandoned for more important structural reasons, but I see how that intent isn&apos;t clear.;Sleep well. I&apos;m sorry to have contributed to your frustration, but I care about this topic. If I&apos;m mistaken or being arbitrary   then I definitely want to be corrected.  I find one sentence paragraphs awkward in an essay, especially when the sentence doesn&apos;t even span the line, and especially when there are multiple in a row. I received several such essays.  It&apos;s not as noticeable if it&apos;s a long sentence, but they read more like headings to me than part of the essay&apos;s body.  The three sentences minimum for a paragraph was taught to me in elementary school, but I feel keeping the paragraph divisions logical trumps an arbitrary rule.Do you really think an essay composed of many very short paragraphs is better than an essay with several larger paragraphs? The former&apos;s structure means it&apos;s nigh impossible to discuss each idea fully.;With food based off of the books we read.  And if no on wants to join me... I will have a bake-off by myself, because baking is fun. Tomorrow I will make orange marmalade kolaches in honor of Alice in Wonderland.

I watched/listened to an interesting discussion a while back between a bunch of authors about a newer genre of writing they termed &apos;urban fantasy&apos; as being this generation&apos;s version of fairy tails. I&apos;ll include the link below, but the summation as I remember it is that as the settings of fairy tails have had less resonance (the forest, castles, etc) we have looked to other things to give us that sense of mystery (for city-dwellers -&gt; the crowds of unknown strangers you pass every day). It was a fun talk and pretty relevant. It also is hosted by Patrick Rothfuss:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52khu_YJAmo;That&apos;s a great thought, Joanna! That lyrical nature of the writing is the first thing I thought about when I started reading Grimms&apos; collection. The repetitious nature of the stories themselves... there isn&apos;t anything quite like it in modern literature. If anything they are more like pop songs.  The reason I hesitate to call things like Star Wars modern version of fair tales derives primarily from the trappings of the setting and the themes/tropes that are associated with modern writing. They may not be fairy tales themselves, but I&apos;d argue they are definitely an evolution of that style of collective storytelling.  ;</string>

            <string>EDIT:  Since there have been so many responses, I feel I should just clarify. I&apos;m not claiming that Shelly ever wrote the book with the intention of having Victor and the monster being one and the same. Point of this was just to point out that it is an interesting way to read the book and that the pieces exist to fit together such an interpretation.  Not sure if I have much to work with here, but did anyone else get the feeling that maybe there wasn&apos;t a monster in Frankenstein?  We only really have two eyewitnesses to the monster in the text, Frankenstein himself and the captain, two sources we have no reason to believe are completely trustworthy. Frankenstein, who relates nearly all of the story, may merely have had a guilty conscience that is not guilty enough to claim full credit for his misdeeds. Sailors have been known for flights of fancy (e.g. mermaids, sea serpents) and we know that Walton had aspirations towards writing - by his own admission he admired poets despite his apparent illiteracy. Did he maybe just run with the story or embellish it for his own ends?Let&apos;s talk about the monster itself now. The monster has an almost supernatural ability to learn, track Frankenstein and yet somehow beat him to his destination. Frankenstein himself has frequent explosive bouts of rage, illness, and despair and seems completely unwilling/unable to seek help or take precautions to save anyone from his creation. The two are opposite sides to the same coin: Frankenstein creates and his monster destroys, Frankenstein loves and the monster seeks to be loved, Frankenstein is associated with knowledge and the monster by his physical aspects, etc. Does he not want to stop the creation or is he aware, at some level, that he is one and the same?Anyone else have any comments on this idea? I plan to explore it a bit more for the submission this week and would love to have some counterarguments to help refine the idea.;I&apos;m not necessarily arguing that Victor was the murderer in all cases, just that in his fractured mind he is making connections that may not be there. William&apos;s death may well not have been because of Victor, but this death had a profound effect on Victor&apos;s already fraying psyche. Victor imagines that his creation, the product of whatever breakdown he was having while at university, was responsible and starts connecting bits and pieces of the reality into his own version of the truth. Clerval&apos;s death is a little hazier since Victor was being a recluse during his creation of the monster&apos;s mate, but there is a parallel in Victor&apos;s dumping of the mate&apos;s body and the monster dumping Clerval&apos;s. Clerval may have been killed by Victor or might have just run afoul of someone else. As for being released from custody, don&apos;t forget that Victor comes from a well-to-do family. I would argue it is his father&apos;s arrival that ultimately gets him set free. There are little explanations for Elizabeth&apos;s death aside from Victor, he was the only other one we know of in the house. When he is found by the townsfolk he has blacked out.The point of this thread was just to point out an interesting alternative to the presumed reading of the novel. There is usually an agreement between author and reader that even in a fantasy setting they won&apos;t outright lie to you, but I just found it a fun thought experiment to look through the book and see &apos;what if the monster hadn&apos;t existed?&apos;;I do remember Walton being really desperate to find a friend he could connect with. Following this line of thought, maybe he was so desperate to be Frankenstein&apos;s friend that he was willing to indulge him in his lie. To that end, Walton lied about seeing the monster to give some closure to the whole account. Something like &apos;at the end of his life Frankenstein came to terms with what he had done and chose to go off on the ice in penance.&apos;  ;Ehh... I don&apos;t think my essay turned out nearly as well as I had hoped due to the space limitations. All the discussion that has popped up on this page is far more interesting. Thanks for the interest though!  ;A true and good point, but it is also at this point that Victor is at his most unhinged. He is fleeing his life and civilization in pursuit of his creation, so if anything I feel his narrative is least trustworthy at this point.  But again, back to the point of Victor drawing connections where none exist, it could also be possible that the peasants saw *something* which Victor took as further proof he was chasing after his creation.;</string>

            <string>Impossible to choose just five from all time, so I&apos;ll stick to ones that have made a big impression in recent years:1. The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell2. The Shape Changer&apos;s Wife by Sharon Shinn  3. The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon4. The Map of Time by Felix J. Palma5. In the Garden of Iden by Kage BakerApart from the sf/f classics, other authors still writing whom I can recommend w/out reservations:   C.S. Friedman, Martha Wells, Julie Czerneda and C.J. Cherryh.;I&apos;m reading Angel&apos;s Game right now in Spanish--&quot;El Juego del Angel&quot;--so far I&apos;m really enjoying it!;</string>
            <string>Have you read the sequel to The Sparrow, Children of God? It&apos;s not as good as The Sparrow, imo, but it really completes the story.;I started reading Ender&apos;s Game, because I saw that a film version is coming out starring Asa Butterfield (from Hugo and Merlin), but I didn&apos;t get very far, mainly because I have so many other things to read now, but also everyone seems so hateful, apart from Andrew (Ender?) and his sister. Does it get better, or is practically everyone in this world a bully?;Love Benedict Cumberbatch! Will try to see this. Thanks!;I got the free Kindle Edition, but I also notice the $0.99 Frankenstein (The Original 1818 &apos;Uncensored&apos; Edition), which implies at least some changes were made to the 1831 edition.;Even if this novel was &quot;just an outpouring of Mary&apos;s teenage angst,&quot; the answer to the rest of the questions could still be, &quot;Yes!&quot; :) I think your second question is the easiest to answer; I do think Victor is responsible for, or at least to, his creation. It is no less &quot;monstrous&quot; for him to create and abandon the creature than it would be for someone to abandon his or her own child. The question of whether or not he &quot;should&quot; create a wife and whether they would have been safe and contented is a stickier issue. As someone who at least aspires to be optimistic, particularly about the transformative nature of love on the human psyche, I would hope the answers to questions 1 and 3 should be &quot;yes! and yes!&quot;;I&apos;m partial to Mel Brook&apos;s Young Frankenstein, though for a non-satirical version, I like Kenneth Branagh&apos;s version of Frankenstein.;</string>
            <string>1.   Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card, sequel to Ender&apos;s Game and even better.....actually made me cry.2.    Lilith&apos;s Brood, a trilogy by Octavia E. Butler.3.   Tales from the White Hart by Arthur C. Clarke, collection of short stories, not much like his later work, funny, and easy to read.4.   Dancers at the End of Time, a series of books by Michael Moorcock, read a long time ago, would like to re-read.5.   A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L&apos;Engle, for getting me interested in SF in the first placeOther notable Fantasy and SF books for &quot;children&quot;.....The rest of the Kairos series by L&apos;Engle, books by Edward Eager (Half Magic, etc.,  unfortunately hard to come by now),  The Dark is Rising series by Susan Cooper (much better than the movie adaptation......), The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Pffeifer.   I suppose I should mention Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis, but I found these a bit preachy, even as a child.;</string>

            <string>I retired a year ago after working in academic medicine for 23 years.   I&apos;m a pathologist with specialty interests in neuropathology and ophthalmic pathology, in addition to having an interest in medical education and education in general.   I still continue to teach medical students and resident, tutoring small groups and giving lectures.   I&apos;ve been reading SF and fantasy since childhood, but have little formal education in literary criticism, so the writing part of the course has been a stretch for me.   The 320-word limit is killing me, but discipline is good for the soul, I guess.I really like the format of the course delivery.   I&apos;ve also enjoyed courses from the Teaching Company (now called the Great Courses) for years.   But Coursera courses provide an option for less passive learning, more interactive learning. So far, I&apos;ve found that actually doing the assignments has increased what I&apos;ve gotten out of this experience.   Apart from getting to read some good stories, I hope to learn to write better.  Based on the discussion forum, lot of energy is being expended commenting on peer evaluation and grading.   It&apos;s difficult to learn to give and receive feedback well but a lesson worth learning.   It&apos;s also a brilliant strategy, providing an educational experience for the learners and not having to grade papers yourself.I would be interested in knowing how much oversight the faculty provides, once all the lectures are in the can.   Professor Rabkin did provide some additional videos and comments after the first iteration of the course.   This is my first Coursera course, so I&apos;m guessing we can provide course feedback at the end?;Great job!   I was criticized by a couple of reviewers for making references to works outside the assigned text in my first two essays (which got 5&apos;s), but when I wrote the 3rd I stuck only to the text and got 4.   So I&apos;m not sure what &quot;the rules&quot; are for these essays. We can&apos;t check our previous education and experience at the door when we write them.   Your writing is a pleasure to read and I especially liked the outside references, especially the Rutherford quotation and the mathematical bits.    I agree with your observation that a connecting phrase between the math and universal themes paragraphs would have made this even better.   Keep up the good work.   ;I agree with Steinbeck (thanks, Kasey, for the quote).   Could it not be that some stories are so compelling that they are incorporated into our subconscious mind and that an author may not even be aware of the specific influences that are reborn in his or her story?   I am not a writer by trade or trained in literary analysis.   When I listen to Professor Rabkin&apos;s talks about the books we have read, I wonder whether the authors would recognize the &quot;hidden meanings&quot;   he pulls out of their   stories.   Were the authors aware of these elements when they wrote them?   Or are they a part of our collective unconsciousness (with apologies to Jung.....) and they crept without conscious intent?;I have to admit I found reading this book pretty tiresome until the monster told his story.      Without revealing to much too those who haven&apos;t finished yet......I thought the monster made a compelling case for his loneliness and that his request for a companion was entirely reasonable.Should Dr. F have created a companion?Did Dr. F, as the monster&apos;s creator and, in some sense, parent, have a responsibility to provide for his well-being?Would the monster and his bride have ridden off into the sunset and lived happily ever after as the monster promised?Or was this all just an outpouring of Mary&apos;s teenage angst?;I, too, am really enjoying this course and am pleased to find so much depth of content in a free online course. I&apos;ve been reading SF and children&apos;s literature for decades, but never had read the 19th century works (apart from Alice). (My current craze is YA dystopian novels.)   So this course has been a great excuse to read some of the classics I never got around to.     I&apos;ve also appreciated Dr. Rabkin&apos;s video lectures.    I try read a little about the author for contextual background before writing my essay.   I usually get the big picture and the obvious symbolism in the assigned reading.    But I have realized that I will never be a scholar of literature.   I just like the stories.I&apos;m decades removed from my formal education, so my essay writing skills are rusty. (I did a lot of technical writing in my career and writing to create educational materials.)   But I have embraced the discipline of writing the weekly essays, although the process is challenging, especially because the assignment is so open-ended.   Having to keep within the 320-word limit has forced me to do several drafts in order to be as concise as possible.   I don&apos;t really need certificate or course credit, so I look at the peer evaluations as useful feedback on whether I communicated effectively.   Useful feedback doesn&apos;t only come from people with advanced degrees.   I gather from the discussion forum that there are a lot of writers and aspiring writers in the course.   So getting feedback from the &quot;great unwashed&quot;, i.e., their audience, is a gift.   And for those of you who aren&apos;t native speakers of English, kudos to you.   I wouldn&apos;t even attempt to write an essay in a language other than English.Doing the evaluations is in someways more difficult than writing the essay.   It&apos;s hard to give specific and meaningful feedback that might help the writer.   But this is also a brilliant move on the Professor&apos;s part.   It&apos;s a learning experience for the student and he doesn&apos;t have to grade the papers!   ;I watched the entire first session of The Following on TV and found the gratuitous violence really disturbing.   For those who haven&apos;t had the dubious pleasure of watching this show.....The cult leader is a Poe scholar who basically teaches his followers that killing frees them from social conventions (or at least I think that was the point). There are a lot of references to Poe&apos;s work and the killers sometimes wear Poe masks.Poe&apos;s work is also disturbing, dark, and depressing, although beautifully written.   I know that art should evoke some emotional response, but right now I&apos;m having a hard time getting into it.   I hope that ^&amp;*&amp;%* show hasn&apos;t put me off Poe for life.    ;</string>
            <string>1. Canopus in Argos: Archives by Doris Lessing2. Dune (the original six books) by Frank Herbert3. Neuromancer by William Gibson4. The Martian Chronicles by Bradbury (I know it made lists above, but it deserves another nod)5. The Stars My Destination by Alfred BesterLooking forward to reading some the recs that are new to me.  ;The repetition of three   s may reference the holy trinity.   I   m not sure how much emphasis the trinity gets in Protestantism (and Germany was mostly Protestant during the time the Grimm   s wrote), but for many Christians the trinity is one of the great religious mysteries, and the number three can assert that something truly mysterious, or in the case of fairy tales, magical, is occurring.   The use of three   s can therefore validate the stories moral and mystical aspects, reminding the listener (or reader) of the mystery and moral teachings that occur in their religion, and lifting the fairy tales up to a more serious level of consideration through the comparison.   ;</string>
            <string>For a formulaic, yet  highly entertaining work I would suggest the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.;</string>
            <string>That series was horrifying in its platitudes and ideology. To make it worse, the author explicitly denies writing &quot;fantasy&quot;...despite the clicheness of his work and how almost all of his tropes can be recognized a mile off. The oh-so-obvious borrowing from Wheel of Time, without any clever spins or additions that are actually interesting, doesn&apos;t endear his works to me either.  I apologize for being a bit strong in my words, but I really, really, really despise that series.  ;</string>
            <string>This is a wonderful poem I read several years ago. At the time, I understood what it was referencing somewhat, but now that I&apos;ve read actually read the original Lewis Caroll, I can appreciate the poem even more:A Sorceror Bids Farewell to SeemI&apos;m through with this grand looking-glass hotelwhere adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns;methinks I shall absent me for a whilefrom rhetoric of these rococo queens.Item : chuck out royal rigmarole of propsand auction off each rare white-rabbit verb;send my muse Alice packing with gaudy scrapsof mushroom simile and gryphon garb.My native sleight-of-hand is wearing out :mad hatter&apos;s hat yields no new metaphor,and jabberwock will not translate his songs :it&apos;s time to vanish like the cheshire catalone to that authentic island wherecabbages are cabbages; kings : kings.                                   -by Sylvia Plathhttp://allpoetry.com/poem/8498369-A_Sorcerer_Bids_Farewell_To_Seem-by-Sylvia_Plath;I read Stoker during what felt like a lifetime ago (I was twelve) but I can imagine the book would be hugely different now that I&apos;m at least nominally an adult. ;</string>
            <string>Interestingly enough, &quot;Lucy&quot; means Light. So literally, her name means &quot;light from the west.&quot; ;</string>
            <string>Loved Chrestomanci and Wind of Fire, I will pay attention to the other books I do not know yet :);</string>
            <string>Does anybody know how long we&apos;ll have access to these posts?   I don&apos;t have time to get into any of these lists of books while I&apos;m doing this course but don&apos;t want to lose such great recommendations.   Based on the ones I&apos;ve read and enjoyed, I can only believe the ones I haven&apos;t will be just as great.   I guess I can print these if I need to.   Thanks, Kitty;thanks, Amber.;Since these stories may have been around for centuries before the Grimms put them in their books, we could be looking at varying cultural reasons for what we find difficult to fathom.   I read hints of   Boethius and his view that God (or at least the Church) has a particular place in life for all of us   and that as the wheel of history moves, the poor will be raised up and the rich brought down.   That could be one explanation for the total acceptance of their sorry state of some of these characters.     ;I enjoyed it too.     Had to force myself to keep to one main point though in order to meet word count.   Good exercise for me and my writing.   ;I was taken by how beauty allowed the princess in the Frog Prince to break her promises and wondered by the Prince would even want her then.   A number of the princesses were spoiled, unpleasant and even rude.   King Thrushbeard in a good example of that.   My footnotes all read &quot;brat&quot;, &quot;snot&quot;, &quot;little liar&quot;, etc.     ;I kept noticing the rules too, how arbitrary and ridiculous they could but I really didn&apos;t connect with that child viewpoint of them.   Thanks for that powerful start in my reflection on these books...;</string>
            <string>I got Nabakov too and my essay was about tricksters so it certainly wasn&apos;t sweet.   Maybe there are just not enough possibilities.. but I&apos;ll take him over some hack.;i like many of you am having problems with these books.   I love all sorts of writing and do enjoy the wordplay and nonsense in these but I get seriously creeped out by some of the images.. and that&apos;s exactly the reaction I had as a child.   The long necked Alice.. Alice too big to get out of the small room... even down the rabbit hole..   These are all nightmate images for me.   I&apos;m hoping with some of the discussions this forum, I can get past this reaction and find some way to do a balanced essay.   But....   ;Wow!   Thanks, Linchuan.   I probably read this many years ago but what a pleasure to read it now with a more recent read of Alice.   Vanish like the cheshire cat sounds a little like the proverbial &quot;call for help&quot; before the suicide.;I don&apos;t know if they helped my insight into the Lord of the Rings story, but the movies greatly enhanced my enjoyment of it.   The beautifully done visuals were so spectacular, they created a whole new way to think about the book (s).   I am finding the same thing to be true with the Game of Thrones TV series - so spectacular, I want to reread the books with those images in mind.;I am not sure I can directly respond to the questions you pose, but I found reading all the Grimm essays I got to review and the ones posted by others for more review, greatly enhanced my thoughts about the myriad ways those stories could be approached.   As far as the Carroll works are concerned, I immediately responded to the language, the poetry, the word play... but the lack of logic put me off .   That is possibly a function of my own personality and my desire to be logical, to understand, for things to make sense.   Not very creative, I&apos;m afraid.   ;I completely agree...     ;I still remember a scene in Dumbo when I think he&apos;s drunk or maybe dreaming.. it scarred me as a child and it still comes up in nightmares once in awhile.       I thought i was the only one who had problems with Dumbo.     :   );</string>
            <string>The question is in the title:D So its pretty clear what answer I am after.Is Course Wiki anything important and Meetup, that I need to join or so in order to finish this course?;Hiya Tim, thank you for the answer to this. Okey good to know that I can totally discard that piece of the page then to focus on the work at hand.  ;Hi I am wondering here how on earth am I meant to summarize over 300 pages worth of writing in 320 words?  Am I only meant to choose a few or sort of make a base based on a broader view gathering all the tales into one?  In any case its a bit confusing since there are so many small tales and obviously there is some difficulty focusing on what to do then, I would see less problem reading a longer story and then thinking about what I have just read but this is a tiny bit difficult.  I am grateful for answers. Thank you so much for reading and thinking to replying me.;Okey thanks:) I am good to go!  Thank you so much for clarifying this for me. I shall intend to do this then instead!  Good luck to all of you and indeed it is a most exciting course to be a part of!  Thank you once again for your answers!  ;To our dear professor, I ask you to read again that tale in Genesis as you cannot read anywhere that it was an apple.  ;</string>
            <string>We&apos;re supposed to read all of the tales in the Lucy Crane Translation and then pick one to write about specifically in terms of plot, themes, imagery ect. That&apos;s the impression I gathered from reading the assignment details under the Peer Responses section. I hope that helps!;Or do the peer review with the text out, that way you can use it as reference. ;To each their own, the question more seemed like do we write about ALL of them collectively or one/some. If you can write about all in a clear, concise, and well organized manner in max 320 words more power to you. Since the assignment doesn&apos;t say specifically, just that the goal is to &quot;enrich&quot; fellow students, it can be interpreted that you can do so with however many you want, as long as it&apos;s well thought out and written.;Alice in Wonderland also has illustrations, but those can be found online separate of the text.;Grimm&apos;s (obvi.) Sophie&apos;s World by Jostein Gaarder (about the history of philosophy) and re-reading (for the millionth time) Alanna: the First Adventure by Tamora Pierce. Pierce predominately writes fantasy novels &amp; short stories with heroines only, no stinky boys hogging the glory!;</string>
            <string>This is not my understanding.   I thought we were to create a thesis based on the collection of Grimm tales.   I hope you are right because it would be very so much more fun to do.   Anyone else?;</string>
            <string>This is the only assignment that is a collection of stories, but I saw the assignment as trying to find a common theme among many stories. I guess we will all submit many different types of responses - it will be interesting to read other folks&apos; approaches.;</string>
            <string>Annemarie, thank you so much for providing the link to the Annotated Alice!;</string>
            <string>Kenneth, You could choose a theme that you see in several stories. For example, I was initially going to write about the idea of &quot;faithfulness&quot; in several of the stories. Or you could write about a type of character or a symbol, like the step mother or birds . I think you coukd also deal with one aspect of one story. Since we&apos;ve all read the same pieces, there&apos;s no need to summarize. Just write about something you found interesting. ;</string>
            <string>I never read Alice as a child, although I&apos;m sure I was aware of it through other media. But, I have read it several times now, especially There and Back Again, because I&apos;ve taught elementary school. One year another teacher and I ran a summer camp based on the books. It was great fun. We had a Mad Hatter Hat Shop with wacky hats the kids made, of course we had a tea party and did lots of other themed activities ( in addition to reading most of the first book). We talked about word play and some of children &quot;got it&quot; but most didn&apos;t. I know the prof asked us to think about whether this book is for kids or adults or both. I think the confusion is part of the experience for kids because it mimics the confusion they often feel when adults speak. That is the theme of my essay. Any feedback?  ;Try focusing on the wordplay.  ;Of course one could always ask, &quot;is it?&quot; Maybe a raven is not llike a writing desk at all... ;</string>
            <string>It seems to me that, prior to making such an accusation, the person ought to have substantiated it with evidence. After all, as you point out, plagiarism IS a serious accusation. In fact, one might even say that the reviewers claim was libel. At the very least it was irresponsible.  ;In the first assignment, I wasn&apos;t either pleased or displeased with the comments. Writing about someone else&apos;s work in a constructive way is not easy. When I teach &quot;Writer&apos;s Workshop&quot; to elementary through high school students, we spend a bit of time reviewing and then practicing giving feedback. I wonder if some of the reviewers simply have not learned how to give appropriate feedback. Perhaps the &quot;powers that be&quot; might do an optional video for those who feel they need a bit more guidance in this area.  ;I think you&apos;re right. It is because Renfield is in the same residence that Dracula is able to enter. It did seem a bit odd that Mina is staying at the &quot;mad house&quot; and I wonder if that was common at the time.  ;</string>
            <string>Hi Ashley, I read &quot;Sophie&apos;s World&quot; several years ago and loved it.   Another fun book is &quot;Looking at Philosophy: The Unbearable Heaviness of Philosophy Made Lighter&quot; by Donald Palmer.   I&apos;m presently reading Nietzsche&apos;s &quot;Genealogy of Morals&quot; and Freud&apos;s &quot;Civilization and its Discontents&quot; in preparation for the &quot;Modernism and Post- Modernism&quot; course from Coursera (starts in July).   If you are interested in finding an easy and enjoyable portal into the philosophy of Hinduism may I recommend   &quot;Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization&quot; by Heinrich Zimmer.   All of these books avoid the long tortuous convoluted arguments that make my eyes glaze over.   Good luck on your journey Ashley. Bruce E. Woodfield, St Petersburg FL USA: a stinky old man trying to hog the glory LOL;Hi Catherine, I&apos;ve read  The Master and Margarita twice and will read it again. Looking forward to checking out Murakami.;I saw something a little different in  Little Brother.   It is a coming of age story.   Its lessons may or may not have been learned by Marcus. The business of government is power and control and it will go to any lengths to perpetuate itself.   I was in my late teens and early 20s during most of the Viet Nam war.   The question on everyone&apos;s mind was: Why are we there? Anybody know?The answer that seems to ring true with me is in &quot;America Betrays Herself in Viet Nam&quot; in  The March of Folly by the great Barbara W. Tuchman.   Once America was sold the frame (I like that concept...it is clarifying)   &quot;being tough on communism,&quot; politicians had painted themselves into a corner. None were willing to extricate us from the absurdity of the Viet Nam war and creating the career-ending perception that they were &quot;soft on communism.&quot;   The practical results of this &quot;do, say anything to stay in power&quot; attitude was that the kids from my neighborhood that I had played with at recess were getting shot and blown up in Asia for no good reason.Many of us didn&apos;t like it and the heart-breaking angst we felt when National Guardsmen shot and killed anti-war protesters at Kent State University was profound.The lesson I learned (and perhaps Marcus failed to learn because good fortune provided him with an influential investigative reporter) was: the government will lie to you, put you in jail or send you to your death if it serves its ends.   Free speech, freedom of assembly and the rights to privacy are myths for the uninitiated.   I agree with John that once action and the governmental reaction was framed as a &quot;war on terror&quot; Marcus had already lost the debate.   The moral of the story to me: unless you are wealthy and have good attorneys on retainer, try not to engage in open hostilities with the police state.   Keep a low profile...keep your head down and your mouth shut.   Say, &quot;yes sir&quot; and then once you are clear THEN engage in whatever subversive activities you must to fight the powers that be.  ;This course is just for fun...not a matter of life and death.   I&apos;m enjoying it because I rarely read fantasy or science fiction, so I thought I would learn something a little different for me and achieve a new perspective perhaps.   I have read some of the books over the years and I&apos;m not totally unfamiliar with the genre.   I read slowly for enjoyment and there is no way I can get through every written word recommended in this course, but I can be selective and spend time with what is of greatest interest to me. I have a &quot;self-interest&quot; rather than a &quot;must do this&quot; attitude.   I live by this motto: Do your Best and Forget the Rest.If I&apos;m not taking a course for degree credit, I can complete the course or drop the course.   It really doesn&apos;t matter. Whenever I have engaged myself with the course material and done my best with the assignments, I feel that I have grown in my ability to look at my world with somewhat wiser eyes.;Wow I learned something new.   I had no idea these courses could be taken for any kind of credit...makes sense though. I have taken some correspondence courses and the work load in each of them was grueling and the exams were killers.   I found I had to get into the reading   as early as possible or I just couldn&apos;t keep up.   Can someone tell me what MOOC means???;Thank you Simrat!;</string>
            <string>I agree Anonymous.   I think having someone share their insights would be helpful, however, having another student GRADE your work is absurd. Why does everything have to be graded? We are not really qualified to critically critique one another.   I still can&apos;t get my head around what these essays are supposed to be about, so I&apos;m just going to share what I find interesting   about a reading and let it go at that. Don&apos;t let anyone bully you intellectually. The only people who know anything are the people with enough self-awareness to know that they don&apos;t know anything   :);CitationsI cite the dark unexplainable phenomena that lies hidden in the amino acid chains of my genetic memory!I cite the seven crystalline spheres that vibrate to the heavenly sacred syllable!I cite the cosmic chemicals that make the eye blink to the brain its visible informed consciousness!  I cite the subversive message spray painted upon the wall!I cite the neon sign that flashes &quot;Awaken to Wonder!&quot;;Just a thought: I&apos;m able to have an emotional reaction to some of the talking animals in Grimm because  I&apos;m  a talking animal and sometimes I&apos;m a rabbit or a frog or a wolf or a raven or whatever.   I don&apos;t think it is possible to have an emotional reaction if we don&apos;t have a psychic connection. The animals (and wicked step-mothers, witches and neglectful irresponsible fathers) in the stories portray human behavior in such an objective and instructing manner so that I can look at myself once removed and think, &quot;Man, I sure don&apos;t want to be like that.&quot; The stories present negative examples as I suspend disbelief and identify with whichever characters manage to vibrate a corresponding cord within me.   Some of Grimms&apos; stories are Greek tragedies in miniature.   They can be cathartic in the same sense.   When I read about Oedipus blinding himself after killing his father and marrying his mother, I think maybe my life isn&apos;t as complicated and difficult as I sometimes make it out to be in my head.   I watch disasters on the TV news and think: this is horrible, I want to see it; I&apos;m glad it ain&apos;t me.   Tragedy prepares one emotionally for the the painful things that befall all of us as we make our way through life.   I live in a carnival fun house where I encounter many scary things that jump out and go &quot;BOOOO!&quot; but very, very few of them are real.   Fear not.;</string>

(For those who don&apos;t know, we&apos;re reading that novel for Arnold Weinstein&apos;s The Fiction of Relationship course.)Aside from that, I&apos;m also reading Georege R.R. Martin&apos;s A Clash of Kings and Haruki Murakami&apos;s Kafka on the Shore. ;</string>
            <string>Started the girl who played with fire.  I should really start the course books lol ;I have to disagree this book is one of the best out there, yes it&apos;s completely mad at times but as the chisire cate says we are all mad here. I don&apos;t know why but I thoroughly enjoyed this, I&apos;ve only finished Alice in wonderland now and have started through the looking glass and to my surprise I&apos;m likening through the looking glass more. This book takes you back to the time when it was fun to imagine things, its not overly complicated but is extremely deep as anyone could interpret it differently, as with the poem jabberwakky.  ;I know this riddle has various answers since I&apos;ve looked it up numerous times before when I was on a wonderland frenzy lol but I was wondering what you guys think.  ; I wasn&apos;t asking for the real answer I was wondering what you first thought when you stumbled upon the riddle.  ;I&apos;m on page 50 of through the looking glass and I&apos;ve noticed that the movie phoebe in wonderland has a lot of references to it. This movie is amazing and I would defiantly recommended to all of you. ;Books are more enriching but movies have this sort of feel to them, I personally enjoy both a great deal. I love seeing the different ways the same story can be portrayed. Most of the time I like reading the book before watching the movie but we have to admit watching a movie is way easier than reading a book , sometimes time doesn&apos;t allow that to be possible. And other cases I enjoy reading thing but would hate to see it on the screen wit just wouldn&apos;t work. So I guess it depends ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m reading the Lord of the Rings (very disappointed not to see it in the syllabus!), as well as pretty much anything about it--Tolkien&apos;s biography, essays about it, etc. When I get into a subject, I don&apos;t go halfway!;I could not agree more. I do like the subtitles, as I have dial-up and can&apos;t watch the videos. But still, it is really difficult for me, as sometimes my Internet connection won&apos;t work and I have to drive out to the library. And I actually would like to see the videos (read the subtitles?) before the assignment is due.;</string>
            <string>How best to write and submit an essay from an iPad? ;I have decided that the pace of this course is too fast for me and am quitting.  I think I need twice as much time for the assignments.  Of course, one problem was the Kindle.  I ended up with a 100 page file of highlights, and there does not seem to be any way to access it except to page through from the beginning, and I kept getting thrown out of it when I accidentally touched a highlighted word. ;I do prefer reading Kindle books on my iPad,, but I was not able to get this version of Grimm on my iPad ;</string>

            <string>I had an evil stepmother growing up and used to imagine horrible endings for her! XDI think though that fairytales have taught me *not* to sit around waiting for a prince on a white horse- to &quot;rescue&quot; myself. I always despised the powerlessness of the females in a lot of the stories.;Watership Down has some &quot;modern&quot; fairytale/folk stories written into it- the folklore of the rabbits, such as El-Ahrairah and the black rabbit of Inle- Richard Adams expanded on these with the follow up book Tales from Watership Down. Some of these cross over into mythology/creation story, I think, but many of El-Ahrairah&apos;s exploits would fit right in with some of Grimm&apos;s tales.;I find some of the stories pointless/meaningless, and also just badly written, with random details added that muddy up the story (like mentioning the child that lives with the giants in The Raven) , and plot lines that are just dropped (poor Falada in the Goose Girl- is her head still hanging on that gate?!). It helps thinking about the fact that the people telling/retelling these stories weren&apos;t professional authors honing their craft, they were just people trying to entertain themselves. Obviously some of the stories have morals, and some are well-&quot;written&quot;, but others are just goofy, and make me think of the the sort of off-the-cuff stories my siblings and I would make up as small children, that for whatever reason were passed along. Perhaps at one point they were more coherent, or had a deeper message, which was lost in the retelling, but perhaps trying to find deeper symbolism in some of these stories is searching for something that was never there.;</string>
            <string>Neil Gaimon for sure is writing modern fairy tales...the Graveyard Book, Coraline.  ;</string>
            <string>Tolkien&apos;s &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;  addresses this question - or  rather, attempts to frame what exactly a makes a fairy story what it is, and I do agree that many modern tales could fit this mold - though The Princess Bride as filmed or written would fail Tolkien&apos;s criteria, as it breaks its own walls to challenge the inner story&apos;s reality.;</string>
            <string>Yes, and I thought it was terrific. But in terms of &quot;new&quot; tales, I&apos;d definitely recommend &quot;A Monster Calls&quot; by Ness. It uses the heart of the old tales and creates a new story.;There is an excellent book about the psychology of fairy tales and their effects on children (relating to comments here) which I&apos;d recommend - &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot; by Bruno Bettelheim. He says that sanitised tales are no use to children and the original ones are helpful in facing fears and coming to terms with the real world. Although I&apos;m not sure he was referring to the Sleeping Beauty version mentioned above!;Good point! I noticed also how servants were generally rewarded for faithful service or severely punished for betrayal or theft, etc.;</string>

            <string>Thank you for bringing this up, Emily. I too am from a science background but have chosen this course to expand my way of thinking. Too often, I have consumed fiction (books, TV shows, movies) as a form of entertainment but not given much reflection on them. I do find it a struggle to synthesize an essay based on whole novel though because I hardly know where to start! The How to Write for this Course video explained the concept well enough but I still find difficulty doing so with a full length novel as opposed to a short story in the example. Hopefully I will get better as I delve further into the course :)  ;Does anyone have any comments on the More to Learn Unit 00 question &apos;Which of the following is a kind of fantasy literature?&apos;The comment given when you click on comic books is&apos;Nope. Although many comic books have fantastic plots or characters, such as superheroes like The Hulk, comic books are not necessarily fantastic or fictitious.&apos;Do you think that statement means not all comic books are fantasy literature or comic books are not fantasy literature at all?;Thanks for responding, Peter! That was a rather tricky question, to me at least :);I suppose you would have to ask, is there a differentiation between fictitious and fantastic? Is one the subset of the other? ie All fantasy is fictitious but not all fiction is fantastic? But then again, if you take the definition of fantasy as &apos;an idea made visible to others&apos;. Are all fiction considered fantasy as well as it originated from the idea of an author?  ;Hi Megan, thanks for the very detailed response. I was just thinking how Prof&apos;s question was tricky because in the choice &quot;comic books&quot; there is an implicit &quot;All&quot; in front of the choice :)You mentioned  Most fantasy is fiction.I would like to ask, do you have an example when fantasy is not fiction?

            <string>This is something I thought to do before starting the reading. The full text of all the stories is converted to a visual display (with some editing to remove common or similar words) using Worldle.net. The result suggests some key themes from the full range of stories. Death, gender, and nature are easy to see, but we can also identify transition/ aging/ evolution from the  prevalence  of words like bride, maiden, woman, queen, princess, daughter, mother, wife, girl and the less represented male roles  son,  father, king.    ;</string>
            <string>It seems to me that this would suggest a huge emphasis on the human relationship be it through family, or societal structure.;</string>
            <string>I absolutely agree with you.But , perhaps, Eric Rabkin tries to remark the importance of writting an oral &quot;text&quot;, suggesting it&apos;s a creative action.;On the other hand, in the background of this snapshot we can detect a lot of symbols that carry us back in time, probably more than two hundred years before the tales were written, when the nature was magic and unknown. I&apos; think it could be interesting to analyse these symbols and I&apos;d like to do my essay about them.  ;</string>
            <string>Dear Moshe, this was also my understanding of how the tales came to be in written form. The  collecting of m _rchen    from storytellers seems to fit well as a mechanism for the philiological research. The oral tradition of storytelling is a universal constant, as are fairytales, as discussed by Professor Rabkin.  The story tellers will put on different voices for characters, and act out scenes in their stories. They are not only sharing the story, or the moral of the story, they are sharing deep held hopes and fears, beliefs and part of their local cultre. Analysing the sounds of the language you ascertain regional changes. I am a Scot who lives in Switzerland with my German husband. His dialect, Schw _bisch, from W _rtemburg, is very different than that of my work colleagues from Baden. Yet Baden W _rtemburg  is classed as one &quot;state&quot; of Germany. Even in relatively small distances the  changes in the spoken language are noticeable. Switzerland   has 4 official languages, but the majority of the population are Swiss German speakers. The  problem is that the Swiss German dialects change rapidly as you travel aroud the country and there is no official written Swiss language. The vowel sounds change from canton to canton, different words are used for the same object, and for German colleagues, it can be almost impenetrable. I can clearly see why this part of the world would be interesting to a Philologist. ;I believe that the wife of one of the brothers also contributed to stories that they put in print. I am sure they wrote some of their own stories too.;Possibly, they might be  scared that people use their minds and form opinions that are not dictated by governments and corporate giants !!! Or maybe  that is my Friday evening cynacism creeping in.;</string>

            <string>Thank you all for your help.;</string>
            <string>dear...the truth lies as so often somewhere &quot;inbetween&quot;. most tales were collected (some have been well known in other countries like france or scotland) some have been changed/re-written or completely written by grimm&apos;s.   ;</string>
            <string>This situation might be a little &quot;both/and&quot;: both oral and written. We are, after all, receiving a written text. On the one hand, the Grimm brothers might have been trying to accurately represent the stories that existed in the oral tradition. Notice that there are many similarities between stories. For example, in both &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Goslings&quot; (40) and &quot;Little Red Cap&quot; (132), the wolf eats a main character whole, and someone else comes along, cuts the wolf up, rescues the person swallowed whole, and fills the wolf with stones. Other stories seemed to be repeats, too, with just a few elements changed. Thus it seems the Grimm brothers were trying to be academic about their project, rather than artistic or entertaining--trying to accurately represent, to preserve, the oral tradition that existed in these areas.On the other hand, in writing the stories down, the Grimm brothers created The Definitive Text. After they wrote the stories down, the stories were not purely oral anymore. It&apos;s the difference between your mom reading you a story, on one hand, and telling you the story about your great grandparents meeting and getting married. In the oral tradition, certain details can be emphasized or changed to reflect a need at that particular time. Notice the stories that emphasize the industriousness of the characters--industriousness as a virtue equal to kindness, patience and faithfulness. This rise of industriousness is absolutely consistent with the times during which the stories were written down: During the 19th century, as industry was growing more prominent, wealth and success--rank in society--could be earned rather than exclusively inherited. What we don&apos;t have--what we can only imagine or guess at--is what these stories would have been like, say, a hundred or two hundred years before they were written down. There certainly wasn&apos;t one story told the same way all the time in all the houses in all the areas in all the land, but I would guess that ghosts of an earlier time still linger in the stories we have today. Some of them seem similar to Chaucer&apos;s Canterbury Tales. For example, the archetype of the miller exists in both. I think it&apos;s important to read these stories with an eye on their oral histories, but also with recognition of the fact that what we have access to is not the oral tradition itself, but a snapshot taken at a very specific time. ;The story of Faithful John reminds me of a story from the Christian Bible, of Abraham and his son Isaac. At some point, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son. Obedience would show that Abraham held God and God&apos;s commands over Abraham&apos;s own desires. From what I remember of the story, Abraham followed God&apos;s command, but at the last moment, God interrupted the sacrifice. It was, after all, only a test of Abraham&apos;s loyalty and obedience. As Abraham passed the test, so God spared Isaac before the sacrifice was even committed.;This story reminds me of Erasmus&apos;s Praise of Folly, where Dame Folly--Folly herself!--describes the virtues of foolishness. Reading it, you wonder at Erasmus&apos;s opinion: is Folly wholly bad, or is she/it really, really to be praised? Is there really some virtue to being foolish? Erasmus, a humanist, was possibly aiming to complicate readers&apos; assumptions and preconceptions. &quot;Hans in Luck,&quot; originating in an oral tradition, might simply be an amusing tale. Everyone has known a foolish person who&apos;s made a very unwise investment, and so everyone hearing the tale (or reading it, for that matter) can laugh about it. And I believe each and every one of us is similarly guilty of making unwise investments, and many of us continue to be foolishly happy or satisfied about them.But this story does make one think, doesn&apos;t it? About whether or not Hans really is lucky?;</string>
            <string>In this course, though, each student may be accessing  a different publication of the text. I included which publication of the Grimm fairy tales I used, even though I used the recommended one, because I didn&apos;t want the people reading my paper to have to guess. It may not matter much when talking about the story as a whole--Rapunzel still lets down her hair no matter what version of the story you read--but when getting down to the details and specific wording, I for one am much more comfortable making it clear which publication I&apos;m using. I don&apos;t know what is or is not in other publications; what I write is accurate for the publication I&apos;ve read.;The Modern Language Association, creator of the MLA citation style, is doing its best to keep up with the growing numbers of ways readers can encounter texts. I don&apos;t know if they have specific rules for Kindles, Nooks, and iPads as of yet, but the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) points out that you can use the rules that already exist and apply them to eReaders. Thus, a citation for the Works Cited page for an eBook looks like a normal citation, but at the end you simply indicate the electronic format:Author Lastname, Author Firstname. Title of Book. Place of Publication:  Publisher, Year of Publication. Type of file.The year of publication, by the way, refers to the year the book was published in an electronic format. Thus, the citation for Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland looks like this:  Carroll, Lewis. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2013. Kindle AZW file.   See these links for more information: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/18/ http://www.mla.org/style/handbook_faq/cite_an_ebook;You raise a good point about the variety of students in the class, Patricia. It probably is enough, at least for the purposes of this course, to simply name the author and title of the work discussed. Still, other information  that is included in conventional citations can be  helpful, such as which version, edition, or publication is being discussed. For example, there are numerous publications of Grimm&apos;s fairy tales, and I&apos;m sure we didn&apos;t all stick to the same recommended version. The differences between the publications may be minor--Rapunzel lets down her hair in every version of the tale, I would bet--and maybe not. Then again, who&apos;s to say what&apos;s minor and what&apos;s not, anyway? In any case, I don&apos;t think it hurts to have access to information  about citation styles, and people can use it or not as they see fit.;I agree with you about the misleading date. However, the citation is supposed to reflect the text you used, which may be different from the original. You can include the year of original publication after the title of the book, like so: Carroll, Lewis. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland. 1865. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2013. Kindle AZW file.But you should also have publication information for the specific text you read.And there are differences between different versions. Curiously, my Kindle version of Carroll&apos;s books seems to have occasionally left off punctuation that I doubt Carroll himself, a Victorian, would have left off. Additionally, some words were missing letters. If I were to directly quote a passage with a mistake, I would have had to do so using  square brackets,  like this (And this is just an example; when looking again, I couldn&apos;t relocate any of the instances where this happened): &quot;The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious thing[s]&quot; (Wonderland, Ch 5).I&apos;m sure I go waaaaay overboard with this :-) I&apos;m glad you are including a citation for the text we are reading.;</string>

            <string>The significance of the changes is a matter of opinion :-) I would argue that almost all changes  are significant. Why change anything if it didn&apos;t matter? Then again, sometimes changes are so subtle that it would take several weeks of intensive study to recognize the impact. That&apos;s probably the case with Frankenstein and this course. Since we&apos;re writing short essays and not, for instance, papers for a journal, either edition probably will suffice.And now for too much information:Anne K. Mellor, in an article called &quot;Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach&quot; (originally published in Approaches to Teaching Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein, 1990, but also included in the Norton Critical Edition of Frankenstein, 1996), says that there are significant differences between the 1818 and 1831 versions. She writes, [W]e must recognize that between 1818 and 1831, Mary Shelley&apos;s philosophical views changed radically, primarily as a result of the pessimism generated by the deaths of Clara, William, and Percy Shelley; by the betrayals of Byron and Jane Williams; and by her severely straitened economic circumstances. These events convinced Mary Shelley that human events are decided not by personal choice or free will but by an indifferent destiny or fate. The values implicitly espoused in the first edition of Frankenstein--that nature is a nurturing and benevolent life force that punishes only those who transgress against its sacred rights, that Victor is morally responsible for his acts, that the Creature is potentially good but driven to evil by social and parental neglect, that a family like the De Laceys that loves all its children equally offers the best hope for human happiness, and that human egotism causes the greatest suffering in the world--are all rejected in the 1831 revisions. (164-5)  In literature, everything is debatable. Whether Mellor&apos;s reading of the revisions is accurate, or whether she is reading more into the revisions than is  actually there, I really couldn&apos;t say. I think you&apos;re correct, though, Dioni, that the free Kindle edition is the 1818 one. Amazon seems to think so, at any rate. (It&apos;s sad that a bookseller seems oblivious to important details such as this one.);Maria, I&apos;ve heard a suggestion in another Coursera course that the quality of peer responses could be improved by allowing the reviewee to respond back to the reviewer. In other words, if I reviewed your paper and didn&apos;t explain myself very well, you could respond to me, asking for clarification or just telling me how helpful my feedback was (or wasn&apos;t). Knowing that someone will write back to me will cause me to be more thoughtful about my comments. Since this course does not have that feature, reviewing the reviewer in an open forum like this makes sense as an alternative. It&apos;s not direct feedback to the reviewer (which would be ideal), but it is an opportunity to redress a wrong, to vent, and/or to try to teach people how to give constructive feedback. ;</string>
            <string>just as when you tell a story or recount an even to a friend, your own personal experience or paradigm is going to have a hand in your presentation of the tale.   similarly, though they did not create the stories themselves but rather collected them, I still think it&apos;s evident that the loss of their father (for example) influenced their interpretations of the stories.;</string>
            <string>Joseph Campbell wrote a &quot;Folkloristic Commentary&quot; for the 1944 edition of The Complete Tales and says that the Grimms were careful to &quot;put the speech of the people directly into print.&quot; and also that they had &quot;a scholarly regard for sources.&quot;   Later editions of the stories were edited for children by the brothers and others.   I think the versions we are reading tend to be more of the original 1813 edition.;</string>

The essays are so short I really do not mind.;I am used to writing essays of 3-4000 words so having to write such short essays is lovely. To reduce the word count to 320 words means I have to have an idea and then stick to it and not wander off from my main theme, so I find the short essay is actually harder to write than the lengthy one. It will be interesting to re read all my essays at the end of this course and see what my total word count is for this course on so many books.;I am loving this course which I have struggled to keep up with owing to the reading on my previous course that has just finished - Greek and Roman Mythology which had lots of reading.

            <string>Makes all those &quot;I&apos;m not a terrorist, I&apos;m just a writer&quot; google searches a little more worrying. ;According to Cassell&apos;s dictionary of superstition (I have some strange books) 3 is not only about the trinity. There&apos;s the entire third time lucky thing which we see a lot here - the third time there&apos;s a different result (to pull an example, in the first story, the third time the rabbit asks the maiden jumps on his tail). There&apos;s also the idea that accidents always happen in threes - apparently an idea connected to Peter denying Christ three times. ;I presumed that since she&apos;d tried to shoo him twice before and he&apos;d come back she thought the only way her family would be rid of him for good was if she went with him. ;I have to agree that I really don&apos;t read ignorance in it. The Cock isn&apos;t ignorant when he goes to fetch the water - he&apos;s doing what he perceives he has to in order to save the Hen, his wife. What is he ignorant of here, exactly? And when the animals follow on he&apos;s not ignorant, or at least the moral isn&apos;t that ignorance kills or it would be he who died and not them as if they do harbor some malignant intent then he&apos;s ignorant of they&apos;re punished for it, not him. I&apos;m also not sure what point you think the cock&apos;s missing at the end. I think it&apos;s a bit of a tricky one. Unless the moral is meant to be don&apos;t be greedy or EVERYONE DIES which...actually that could work but then the story should be from the hen&apos;s perspective. ;I agree very much. To an extent I can accept that picking up these books is going to expose me to a level of sexist and racist language that is going to make me uncomfortable and by acknowledging that before I start I can at least accept it. Sometimes things strike me out of the left field though. I&apos;ve made one attempt at reading a Bond novel and I was expecting the sexism and the racism but I got blindsided by the homophobia. I presume part of the reason for choosing so many older texts is to make the course more accessible for those of us on smaller budgets but, yeah, some of these readings are going to be quite difficult. ;Repetition is a powerful tool for learning. Remember that these stories were intended to impart lessons to their audiences, they weren&apos;t just for entertainment, so being easily remembered was a bonus. I think an element of it is that these were oral tales. If you&apos;re narrating a story - especially to children, you don&apos;t say &quot;he did it three times...&quot; You say &quot;he did it, and it didn&apos;t work! Then he tried again, and it still didn&apos;t work. And then he tried AGAIN and THIS TIME...&quot;   It builds anticipation into the story, particularly as we expect that different outcome the third time so it builds to it. If he achieved the first time it wouldn&apos;t be as meaningful (an achievement is always worth more if you fail first). I think that&apos;s much less effective in writing then read out loud. It also makes a part of the story familiar which promotes engagement with it. These stories were moral tales - intended to teach lessons. It was important that they were engaging and memorable. Repetition is a strong memory tool and by repeating the audience learns as they go so they can join in with reciting the story which gives them a sense of personal investment in it. ;Who says your wrong? Your ideas were the best ideas you had in light of the information you had at the time. I hate this idea that you&apos;re &apos;wrong&apos; if you don&apos;t immediately jump to the solution that scholars who&apos;ve dedicated large portions of their life to studying something have reached.   Also, presuming somehow you have made some horrible blunder and claimed the sky is green and you are obviously and irreconcilably wrong. Why is that a bad thing? To start with, this is a safe space to be wrong. I don&apos;t know you. You don&apos;t know me. What does it matter to you what I think of you? It doesn&apos;t. You&apos;ll never meet me so this is the ultimate safe space as no judgement any of us make on you here will ever have any impact in the real world. Second, sometimes being &apos;wrong&apos; is good. Nobody&apos;s expecting you to hand in a work of scholarly brilliance for your first essay. They&apos;re not expecting it for your last essay - what they&apos;re expecting though is that you&apos;ll grow. Part of growing is getting stuff wrong. What did you get wrong and why? Did you not think closely enough about the cultural background? Because that&apos;s a lesson for next time. Did you infer something about the authors that was wrong? Because that&apos;s a lesson for next time. Did you not consider an element of the text? Because that is a lesson though the lesson there may be that you can&apos;t consider everything. In much the way Grimm&apos;s tales were influenced by their culture, our essays and readings are going to be influenced by our cultures and ideas. I think what might also help you is refocusing a little. Ultimately this class isn&apos;t about learning about twelve books. That&apos;s an exciting element of it but what it&apos;s trying to do it make you in to a more thoughtful reader which is a skill you can take with you. When you&apos;re picking up a novel from your shelf someone won&apos;t stop by and lecture you on it before you begin - but you don&apos;t need that crutch to draw meaningful analysis from a story and that&apos;s the skill this course is trying to give you - an ability to draw meaningful analysis without having to be told what the outcome of that analysis is first. And maybe your meaning will never be the one the scholars give but if you get more meaning and pleasure from reading isn&apos;t that an end in itself? ;Well said, Daniel. It seems to me that a bad pedagogy is one that&apos;s based on regurgitating remembered &apos;facts&apos; instead of critical thinking and developing cognitive skills which allow you to generate your own meaningful ideas. Which is also exactly what I think is wrong with the education system as a whole and the changes Michael Gove is making in the UK specifically but don&apos;t even get me started, you won&apos;t like me when I talk politics and education. I think the part of your argument I disagree with, Jerard, is that you&apos;re thinking the &apos;meat&apos; of the course will be the taught material and the reading is meant to supplement that. I&apos;m looking at it the other way round. To me the &apos;meat&apos;, the point, is the time I spend reading the books. It&apos;s how I can already feel myself developing as a more thoughtful and attentive reader and the lectures are there for me as a supplementary resource but they&apos;d bias my reading if I had them before I read as I&apos;d be looking for what the lecturer had told me about, not finding meaning for myself in the text. I think, ultimately, the thing is that with a literature course there aren&apos;t necessarily right answers and that&apos;s kind of upsetting. I get that, in my other-life I&apos;m a science teacher but this isn&apos;t like science - there aren&apos;t absolutes and the only wrong answer is the one you can&apos;t support. Your answer isn&apos;t wrong because it doesn&apos;t match the interpretation the course has given you, just different, and ultimately if those videos had been released at the start we&apos;d have a plethora of essays about those videos and those interpretations, not about the source text. ;That&apos;s really interesting. I like the idea of the unpredictability of Wonderland being the unpredictability of the adult world to a child. It also makes sense of Alice&apos;s uses of lessons. In Wonderland though less in looking glass she constantly attempt to understand and control her surroundings by applying the &apos;lessons&apos; she has been taught in school - the things that are meant to enable her to function in the adult world - and she&apos;s constantly thwarted. That makes a lot of sense as we do teach kids a lot of things in school we insist they&apos;re going to need in the real world and ultimately most of them won&apos;t help them control or interpret their world (not that those things are meaningless but that they don&apos;t have this practical application we insist on). ;I&apos;m not sure what you mean by symbolism of the name. Can you expand on that a little. I thought you meant what the name symbolises as in the image it creates for the reader but you&apos;re talking about the scene where Alice loses her name so do you more mean the symbolism of names as in what does the possession of a name symbolise? Names generally symbolise identify - to strip someone of their name is to remove their identity as an individual (think prisoner or soldiers being addressed be a number or rank or whatever - the intent is to remove their identity, their individuality, and make them something else). I think Alice losing her name is mostly to do with her losing her sense of self - something that&apos;s a recurring theme across both books. Sorry if I&apos;m entirely off target there. ;I&apos;m going to disagree, actually. I think that if the videos were released earlier people would watch them earlier and it would bias their reading. I very much like the aspect of the course where we&apos;re forced to present our own interpretation before we&apos;re allowed access to opinions that are likely to bias our own. It means we actually have to read and think and process. The course is very time intensive but I would point out that once the videos are released they are there for the rest of the course. If those 48 hours are your busiest then just mark during that time (the marking doesn&apos;t take long) and then watch the videos the day after before starting the next reading. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to entirely avoid overlapping the readings on this course due to the length of some of them (I don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to read Dracula in 4 days) so that&apos;s just an aspect you&apos;ll have to deal with. The only argument I can see is for early release of the &apos;start of reading&apos; videos for each book but they might recap ideas from earlier lectures so if that&apos;s the case I can see the argument for not doing it too. ;</string>
            <string>I think there are a lot of class issues tied up in Mina too. When you compare Mina to Lucy and how they&apos;re portrayed you see that Lucy is seen as the ideal. She is so lovely, so innocent and so pure that not only do three wealthy and powerful men, one with a title, propose to her on the same day (and what more could a woman want then a husband - women exist only to be desired and protected by men) but Dracula, on first landing, is immediately drawn to her as she is all that&apos;s good about English women. Mina, on the other hand, is still lovely but she&apos;s working class where Lucy was upper class. We&apos;re told at the start that she&apos;s a deputy school mistress and we know she had no parents. We know Jonathan was also like this but when they pass in to money while he continues his work she immediately stops to tend house. Though she is surprisingly practical and useful given the representation of Lucy she is still ultimately seen as something to be protected by men and also as something less desirable then Lucy (she is their consolation prize - they couldn&apos;t save Lucy so they will save her. Dracula only takes an interest in her to upset the men - she&apos;s a tool for him). Also, Stoker uses Mina as a mouthpiece in the scene where she&apos;s watching Lucy sleep to explicitly criticise New Women and their ideas - drawn out more in how she says these women will soon want men to see a woman sleep before she even proposes (see her sleep, right) and then it&apos;s Dracula encountering Lucy in her sleep (before he even proposes, the cad) that leads to her ultimate death. ;Societal norms often aren&apos;t as strict as people would like to believe. In the past, if there was a thing, women did it. Often not in the quantities that men did it but they did it. They dressed as men to go to war, the wrote novels, conducted scientific experiments, made music. We like to believe that women working is a new enlightened thing but, of course, women have always worked. What&apos;s new is upper class women who don&apos;t have to working (see again Mina who works until they come into money then stops). And, ultimately, people are always people. There will always be just as many suborn, righteous, strong and brave women as there are men, we&apos;ve just constructed a cultural narrative where these people don&apos;t exist and so we erase them. It&apos;s one of the reasons stories are so powerful. They tell us about the world and we accept truth from them - even if we know the work is fiction - and they shape how we interact with the rest of the world. Women played strong roles throughout history so it&apos;s not out of place for them to do so in historical fiction - it&apos;s just outside the narrative we&apos;ve built for ourselves about what women were like &apos;back then&apos;. Stoker was making a statement with his book about how he thought men and women should be. He was very clear about it - we&apos;re constantly told of the strength and bravery of men and how they&apos;re to protect women and how sweet and childlike women are (at one point I underlined every time the word sweet was used to describe a woman then I gave up in despair). Of course that message is a reflection of the society he lived in and the messages other people were creating about women at that time but it doesn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t a very deliberate message. It is in fact very easy to read a narrative on the dangers of female sexuality in this book. ;I think it&apos;s also worth noting that they don&apos;t bring Mina because they recognise her inherent value but so they can better protect her. She&apos;s not there to be an active participant in the demise of the person who&apos;s wronged her, it&apos;s made abundantly clear that it&apos;s her husband&apos;s right to kill Dracula for messing with his stuff. Ultimately, they act as though it&apos;s not Mina herself who&apos;s been wronged but rather the men who consider her theirs and who she is being taken from. ;Anthony makes some good points about the story being logical but I want to pick up on you asking if wonderland has laws. I think there are still certain natural laws that hold true within wonderland (eating changes Alice&apos;s size, for example). It&apos;s not truly a world consisting of only chaos. She doesn&apos;t eat some things and they turn her in to an octopus and another time is makes her invisible and another time is transports her to Canada and another time is causes a butterfly to die - there&apos;s always the predictable effect on size. ;I find it really frustrating that I can&apos;t argue back XD I&apos;m clearly too argumentative. I disagree with some of my evaluation though agree with other points of it. At the end of the day it&apos;s my own evaluation of my work and how I&apos;m progressing that&apos;s important, though, so I need to focus on that so I don&apos;t get too frustrated. ;Yep, I&apos;m hoping that too. I think I&apos;m going to tell people how many point I&apos;m giving them and why in future reviews as I know I&apos;d like to know that from my reviewers. ;Nice idea in theory but I can see it leaving to long drawn out arguments among people with no redeeming value. I think the best thing about this system is that you can&apos;t do that, you kind of just have to accept it and it&apos;s as annoying as all hell because I&apos;d very much like to e-mail someone now and tell them they missed the point of my essay but if I could I&apos;d get tied up in arguing that one point with one person and I&apos;d get increasingly angry and frustrated with it all. This way I can say &quot;I think they&apos;re wrong&quot; to myself and that&apos;s the end of it. It WOULD be nice if we knew how many points exactly different people had given us (did peer x criticise but still mark highly indicating their criticism wasn&apos;t a strong one, for example. Or if that person who left you really intelligent feedback so who&apos;s opinion you respect marked you highly that might make up in your head for the fact that the person who missed the point gave you nothing).;You could but, maybe I just distrust people on forums but I can see people who were unhappy with a mark harassing the person who gave them that mark. I can see value in it but I think it would create a lot more points of conflict then of genuine exchange and if someone has raised an issue you want to discuss then you can always start a new thread for it on the forum. ;I like that a lot. I didn&apos;t think to do it as I presumed it&apos;d tell you the mark they gave you. ;I will completely back going to see this. I didn&apos;t get to see it live but I&apos;ve seen the recording twice - with Cumberbatch as the monster and with Miller as the monster - and it is an amazing play. The reason I actually picked this course above any others is it listed Frankenstein as a reading and I&apos;ve wanted to make time for it since I saw this. It is an incredibly powerful piece of theater. ;It really amuses me how it&apos;s not just our culture it&apos;s permeated either. I&apos;m a fan of a Japanese animation called Hellsing which is about the heir of the Hellsing family who fight evil in England using a vampire captured by her family called Alucard (take that and reverse it). It actually features some amazing kickass women but it&apos;s kind of weird to see something we think of as so dominant in western culture interpreted in to what the Japanese think our culture is like. ;I do prefer 1st person - I think it&apos;s more emotionally engaging. For the criticism that you don&apos;t know if they&apos;re going to die or not a friend of mine wrote a blog entry about that recently that says what I want to only better. http://itsthefuturestupid.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/why-george-r-r-martin-is-wrong-about.html;That&apos;s really interesting. I wondered while I was reading which things Stoker invented himself and which he used from existing folklore. ;I&apos;d agree with that entirely. I read it and other things as a kind of condemnation of our modern world view (and secularism, particularly) as throughout there&apos;s a lot of emphasis on trust and faith and believing each other other evidence and the fact that failure to engage with local traditions and superstitions consistently places people in danger - is Jonathan had attended to the beliefs of the locals instead of dismissing them from the beginning the entire thing might have been avoided and while religion and God is present throughout the book in the later stages they come more and more to rely on it and to note how they&apos;re placing themselves in the hands of god - moving away from their modern ideas and reason to something closer to the religion the natives display at the beginning that Harker thinks himself so above. ;Though it&apos;s through book learning that he comes across the traditions they are still traditional and folk stories he&apos;s drawing from. He might learn them in a book but it&apos;s not science that defeats Dracula. Though, actually, he knowledge of psychology is used so I suppose I should modify my argument to say that it isn&apos;t complete rejection of science but an argument to not reject an idea because it isn&apos;t scientific? That if people of learning can keep traditional and religion also and not be ruled by science alone and unable to have faith they&apos;ll be stronger for it? ;Not really. i had a hard time pulling it all together at the end and felt my concluding remark was a bit vague. We&apos;ll see. ;I should hope not, that seems incredibly harsh. ;</string>
            <string>I think my first lot might have just been cop-out responses as I didn&apos;t really think about what I would expect in a response but in my latest set I took about ten minutes per essay, said what grade I&apos;d given, gave a general comment and then where possible gave specific examples of what I thought was good and what I thought was bad (so, for example, in the first set I just said &quot;some spelling mistakes&quot;, in this second set of peer reviews I said &quot;There were a few spelling mistakes including [example].&quot; I think...I don&apos;t know. After having read quite a few essays I&apos;m not letting the quality of the reviews bother me as I know that my essay compared favorably to others and also knowing the standard of work of some other students means, not to be harsh, but I&apos;m not overly concerned about their opinions. ;Have ONE thesisI&apos;ve come across a lot of essays that throw a LOT of idea around but don&apos;t have one core idea that&apos;s well explained. Make sure you know what you one idea is and...Make sure what you&apos;re writing relates to your thesisI&apos;m sure that aside about something unrelated was fascinating but you don&apos;t have a lot of words here so make sure you use every word to strengthen your thesis. You don&apos;t have a spare paragraph to tell me how lovely the weather is right now. Make sure your thesis is about the bookThis should be a no-brainer but I don&apos;t want to know about the author, no matter how fascinating they may be. I don&apos;t want to know about how the book has influenced writing or culture or your pet cat. I want to know about the book. ;Lucy becomes a vampire (a woman of strong sexuality) and as well as preying on men who admire and love her she becomes a killer of children. Think the baby at Castle Dracula - there&apos;s no implication that the child becomes a vampire. No - it&apos;s implied to be killed by Dracula&apos;s wives so instead of gifting life to children as pure women do (see Mina at the end of the book) they take the lives of children. ;</string>
            <string>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib1ERGQnloU Mr Raven by MC Lars Not a reading but still worth a listen. ;I think it helps to think of the monster as a child. He is a child, only a few years for this world and of the many things that Frankenstein failed to teach him, personal responsibility was one. While personal responsibility is great and he does lack it I think it&apos;s important to remember that while we do all have ultimate responsibility for our own actions - things outside of ourselves can force our hand in a given direction which is what happened here. The monster doesn&apos;t take responsibility for what he did but at the same time WOULD he have killed if, instead of running, Frankenstein had taken responsibility for the life he brought forth in to this world? If he had been granted just that small amount of human comfort instead of shunned for his appearance?;Francine, I found the book very hard at first as I strongly dislike Frankenstein but I found the section where the monster narrates his take to Frankenstein to be a lot more engaging (problems with the lack of a high level of finesse in the story-telling persist but at least I didn&apos;t actively dislike the protagonist) so stick with it? ;Though Van Helsing may well be a trained medical doctor he is not a practicing doctor at the time at the novel, which is what the question asked. He&apos;s a professor and he likely lectures in medicine so he likely was a doctor in the past but he is now working as a professor. ;Maitane, please remember that your reviewer has no way to know for sure that English isn&apos;t your first language. Even then, this is a literature class with a high level of English stated as a requirement, there is going to be a high expectation of the spoken English. I tend to judge generously (if it&apos;s understandable I give it a 2) but if you know your English is going to be a sticking point then you might want to find someone to read your essay for you before submission to help with your written English. If you asked around the forums I&apos;m sure you&apos;d find people to help. Though I do agree with you that, yes, marking on the second part for grammar is a bit of a problem. Especially as you seem quite clear, though I mist admit that I&apos;ve marked essays where the English is at a level where I couldn&apos;t understand what they meant at all so I felt I had to mark the second section as a 1 as I couldn&apos;t assess the validity of their argument as their argument was unintelligible. ;It&apos;s a complicated question actually. I think the monster&apos;s request (for someone to love him) was reasonable but also a lot of Frankenstein&apos;s reasons for not following through (the fact that the female monster may well reject the existing monster and make the situation worse) was also valid. Maybe instead of creating another monster, Frankenstein should have taken the monster he had already made in and shown some responsibility for the life he created. ;Yep. Afraid with this course it&apos;s kind of just luck of the draw as to how you&apos;re graded so I wouldn&apos;t panic. I don&apos;t mind peer marking so much but I do kind of wish we graded the same peers every week and were graded by so there was some kind of consistence to the grading and we could actually help each other build on previous work and provide new helpful comments. It could still be anonymous, just the same anonymous voices every week would be nice. Though then I suppose if you&apos;re stuck with 5 critics you&apos;re in trouble. ;That&apos;s kind of depressing. I can see the point and the reason - I just feel like every week I&apos;m starting from scratch both as a writer and as a reviewer. I&apos;ll feel a lot better when I&apos;ve achieved the minimum required to pass and I know all this effort won&apos;t be rendered void by someone who&apos;s feeling a little mean when marking. ;Both have a vested interest in the case they present. The &apos;truth&apos; such as their is truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Like any person born the monster was probably born with the potential to violence and then driven there by the things that happened to him. But ultimately all the narrators in this story are unreliable so anyone guess is as good as anyone elses. ;...any book used in the construction of the essay should be mentioned there - whether quoted or not. So if I use an idea I found when reading around in my essay I need to quote the source for that idea even if I don&apos;t directly quote it. ;Further clarify - If you use page numbers in your citations ie (Shelly 142) you NEED to say which edition of the book you&apos;re using as what&apos;s on page 142 in your book might not be on page 142 in my book. So in that case where you provide page numbers you DO need to cite the unit book. ;Surely if you want to explore something new you could mind-map ideas after reading the text and select one for yourself that you feel will challenge your limits? ;Science is more than just a process. To say science is a process and ethics are only tangentially involved is the same as saying art is a process and ideas are only tengentally involved as it&apos;s humans making the art. This is basically true, there is a certain process to doing an experiment or painting a picture but it&apos;s the meaning that the scientists and artists give to that work, ethical and morally as well as practically, that really define science and art. Science isn&apos;t a thing, it&apos;s a community and it&apos;s people. ;</string>
            <string>I think this thread neatly illustrated why we shouldn&apos;t have the ability to open a dialogue with our reviewers. I get that because I get as pissed as the next person at some of the vague and odd things I&apos;ve got in my peer reviews and I&apos;ve wanted to hit out to and, ultimately, if you allowed that dialogue that&apos;s what would happen. A few people would use it to open a genuine dialogue, most (probably myself included, I&apos;m not judging) would use it to start a fight with their reviewer. After all, how dare they say that about your essay! How dare my reviewer accuse me of plagiarism! How very dare they! And we&apos;d get embroiled in attacking each other, digging our heels in and refusing to acknowledge we might be in the wrong in how we spoke to them as they do the same to us and in the end all we&apos;ve done is hurt more feelings and made a mess. Any satisfaction there might be in it is ultimately outweighed by the likelihood of hurt and anger. So, no, I don&apos;t want to talk to my reviewers. I will let the entire thing flow over me. Also, I don&apos;t know I&apos;ve accused any of my essays of being shallow but to the people complaining about it, it&apos;s possible they mean your treatment of the topic was shallow, not the topic itself. ;I think I have the tell-tale heart one. Considering marking down as I have previously marked down for people who spent their essay comparing it to other outside sources - the exception being things like mythology or the bible. ;Expecting them as they&apos;re essentially part of our cultural mythology. It&apos;s a fairly valid assumption that most people will have at least a passing grasp of, for example, the story of creation in genesis (though I would also expect the essay to not presume detailed knowledge of the story). It&apos;s culturally assumed knowledge and I know that assumption isn&apos;t valid for all cultures but this is a course hosted by an American university and the lecturer treats them as assumed knowledge so I think that&apos;s valid. On the other hand, if I went up to a stranger in the street and asked them if they&apos;ve read &quot;The time machine&quot; to grab an example, most of them would say no. It&apos;s not assumed cultural knowledge, most people do not know the plot of the time machine and most people would not expect you to know the plot of the time machine. I should further stipulate that of course it&apos;s valid to compare your book to an outside source but I think it&apos;s essentially impossible to do it in a meaningful way in an essay of this length with a text that is not assumed knowledge. ;</string>
            <string>Sean, I think that&apos;s a very interesting point. We need to think about why a comparison is being drawn. If it is to show that a work influenced the one that&apos;s being read then this is especially valid. We can presume that all the authors we&apos;ve encountered so far would be versed in christian mythology. It&apos;s clear, for example, that the story of the fall was an influence in Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter. The other thing we can do and what I&apos;ve seen a lot more often is draw parallels between two writers but not claiming that one was a direct influence on the other and I believe that not only is this a lot harder to do well but it&apos;s a lot harder to do in the word limit imposed by the course. I&apos;ve seen a few &apos;these stories share these themes&apos; but, really, how does knowing that enrich your reading? You need to talk it a step further and explore what that implies, if anything. Is is just a common writing technique they both used - was there a shared inspiration of life event or educational quirk that caused that - does it tell us something about society and the pervading cultural ideas or about literature or about the human condition? Just pointing out that two stories hold similarities isn&apos;t actually deeply enlightening, especially if one isn&apos;t even an assigned text. ;Genesis 2.17 - But  of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.King James VersionGod never commanded that Adam and Eve should not eat of the tree of life. In fact he said they could eat any tree BUT the tree of knowledge so, yeah, I agree with Nola. ;I think it&apos;s a lot to do with the dropout rate. I, too, gave me first 6 this time. It was an essay that was a true pleasure to read and really broadened my thinking about a story. I think the form in particular has improved significantly, there are far fewer essays with obvious errors coming through now. I presume this is due to people with a low knowledge of English struggling with and subsequently leaving the course which is actually quite depressing when you think about it. Content has also improved but I haven&apos;t seen the marked increase in content I did in form. ;Yeah, that&apos;s a fun comment. I&apos;ve learnt to just take my peer reviews in my stride. I get at least two that are in direct contradiction on any given week and have been accused of plagiarism for using &apos;words from the text&apos; so I think the key is that unless you&apos;re not getting a passing grade unfairly, let the entire thing wash over you. ;That would be interesting. I think the natural of the subject, something inherently based on interpretation without clear right and wrong answers, means that the peer marking is the only way to go but I do agree that it&apos;s unfair. I think the rubric is unfair - giving 50% of the marks on the course for form is unfair in my eyes as while correct English is important the ideas contained within the words are inherently more valuable. ;</string>
            <string>On this day (June 8) in 1949, Orwells 1984 was first published. That  s quite some timing with the latest mass surveillance news!;The reason I  m fascinated with this tale is precisely the ambiguity you point out. As the story unfolds I grow increasingly frustrated with the bad exchanges Hans makes, and fear he will end up in total misery. But the guy stays  completely cheerful. So there is a dissonance between what I  expect Hans  to feel and what he is actually described to feel. This mystery keeps the story alive  to me, it is as if my mind  keeps looking for an explanation, but  doesn  t find one.;</string>
            <string>Hi everyoneJust to make sure of something, is the essay supposed to be about the book as a whole?Thanks!;</string>
            <string>I was wondering about that as well. Should we write about the whole book or just choose one story in particular?;</string>

            <string>I am sure that many of you have, by now, noticed that these peer reviews do not contribute, in any way, to this course. First of all, why are we not supposed to give grade 6 too often? I would rather give it than stick to the &quot;let&apos;s grade everybody negatively so that he/she could learn something&quot;. The effect that this has is quite the opposite - many people, initially delighted with this course, have decided to quit. Even I (and I don&apos;t give up easily) am thinking about it.My essays, so far, have been graded 4.5, 4, 4. Whatever I write, there is some (pardon my language) jerk who can&apos;t find anything good in it, who is rude, who even insults me...and I find that very unpleasant, so much so that now, when I have to click on the results, I have to think twice. That is NOT a feeling that one wants to have when attending a course.In a nutshell, peer reviewers are unreasonably mean.;Theo, you are forgiven - if, indeed, it was you. So, next time, say &quot;I doubt you read the book but I&apos;m willing to believe you did&quot; :);I&apos;m fine with criticism if it&apos;s nicely put - for example, &quot;I believe you should do this or that, or change this or that&quot;.However, when a peer writes &quot;this doesn&apos;t make sense&quot; or &quot;you obviously did not read the book&quot; I don&apos;t find that helpful at all, especially since I did read all the books so far.If somebody graded my essay as 2, I would also be fine with it, as long as there&apos;s some explanation - what I get are 4&apos;s and some dubious comments...I expect that, at some point, I will also be charged with plagiarism - I see that some people have been.I got to admit that my ego is involved here as well, since I hold Master&apos;s degree in English literature :) But, honestly - all the other courses I&apos;ve taken had really decent, very uplifting peer evaluation processes. Not this one, though.;DaveN, that would have made me laugh as well!! Good one.;Anonymous, you&apos;re quite right. I love your &quot;hammer-nail&quot; metaphor.I suppose I expected too much out of this course, I thought it would be fun and interesting and delightful...yet, all I do is write essays and stress about their evaluation. What gets me the most is the fact that I&apos;m really positive when commenting on other people&apos;s essays...and then it&apos;s just boom! My own get dissected. Oh, well...;Homosexuality thread, you say? I&apos;m on it! Hope it&apos;s nasty :) Am in the mood to argue.;Lauren, thank you! That was exactly my point - there&apos;s something called motivation and positive feedback. One can&apos;t expect to get that here, and I should stop wining about it :) After all, this is a free course. And I don&apos;t have to write all 10 essays in order to get a certificate. Yay!;What I find, Francine, is this: the harder you work on your essay, the lower your mark is. So, maybe we should just phone it in the next time and see how it goes :);Maria, I don&apos;t know how many Coursera classes you&apos;ve taken, but 90% of them is based on peer evaluations...which I absolutely hate! My favourite ones were the ones where there&apos;s a quiz (The Ancient Greeks) or an exercise (Archeology&apos;s Dirty Little Secrets). That is to say, where evaluations are not primary forms of grading. And you&apos;re absolutely right, it all leads to downgrading and competitiveness rather than cooperation. And I&apos;m guessing that peer reviews are going to become a major turnoff for any Coursera student and, potentially, a threat to Coursera itself.;I was just about to say that - other courses deal with peer reviews a lot better.;Amen to that, anonymous!;Poe preferred port. So, let&apos;s make it amontillado :);Husbands rarely tell the truth :) Which is not to say that your essays are not great! I had a rant of my own on a thread earlier, regarding peer reviews - they&apos;re so negative that it&apos;s getting ridiculous.;</string>
            <string>Can anybody tell me how we&apos;re supposed to write about Poe AND Hawthorne in 320 words? 320 is not nearly enough! I can&apos;t possibly give a good argument about both of these writers using only 320 words.So, if I choose only one of them, what&apos;s going to happen? Am I going to be marked down?;Yeah, hopefully :);</string>
            <string>I didn&apos;t find any selected readings for Unit 1 at the Syllabus page. Where did you find them?;</string>
            <string>I would agree with Joshua - I think it shouldn&apos;t matter too much whether you choose the whole book, or just one story, the same as it won&apos;t matter whether in other units you choose the whole book or one event within it. The point is to enrich others understanding. You can do that by writing about all the stories and what links them (which might be very ambitious!), just linking a few stories or just picking one.  ;I like this analysis of the cat and mouse :) it does seem to be a warning to how not to be too trusting to the point of being taken advantage of. Not too sure about Hans in Luck though... Although there are elements of it being about trust and being, essentially, ripped off, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s really what it was about. To me, it read more that luck is really judged by the person experiencing it. What is lucky to one might not be to another, and even to end up with nothing isn&apos;t a bad thing, if that&apos;s what  makes you content.  ;They are only children, and we don&apos;t know how young. A child doesn&apos;t necessarily think about production of grain and the good rain can do. They had just left their home, with no idea of where they were going or what they were going to do. They were sad and probably scared. It would only be natural that from a child&apos;s point of view, when it started raining, they thought it was some higher being was weeping for them.  But it&apos;s not just that - i feel the Grimm brothers are trying to create an atmosphere of hopelessness. By saying the sky was weeping with the children, creates the idea that the situation they&apos;ve found themselves in is all-encompassing, and has surrounded them.  ;I think they just have been having a really bad day.  On a serious note though, I like it as an opening sentence. To me, although its pessimistic, it gives the impression that at some point it WAS worth wishing for what you wanted, and for me that sort of statement lets me relax into the story. It&apos;s as if they&apos;re giving me permission to believe the story, however far fetched.  ;</string>
            <string>I love the book, but then again, I love books where I can just relax and embrace the nonsence, especially if the nonsence actually makes a lot of sense. I can understsnd why some wouldnt enjoy it, but how about just sitting down with it and letting it tell you a story. For those who are enjoying the topsy turvy craziness of it all, id highly recommend the book The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster :);Hi,  I&apos;m sorry you feel you were unfairly marked; as with everyone&apos;s essay we dont know who marked it or just how strong their grammatical knowledge is. However, being as polite as possible, have you thought yours may not be as strong as you initially thought? There are at least three obviousmistakes in your first paragraph alone:&apos;Difficult to having&apos; should be &apos;difficult having&apos; or &apos;difficult to have&apos; (disposing of the &apos;being&apos; later on).&apos;Theses aspects&apos; should be &apos;these aspects&apos; (although that might just be a typo)&apos;Reviews of my essay was unecessarily&apos; should be &apos;were unecessarily&apos;&apos;Perhaps your essay contains similar minor slip ups that you hadn&apos;t noticed? If you&apos;re certain it didn&apos;t, fair enough and you should see if there can be anything that can be done, however going by your example above I wouldn&apos;t be too quick to blame your markers.;Speaking of &apos;obvious mistakes&apos; - this tablet keyboard is killing me!;I think if you only made the same &apos;seriousness&apos; of mistakes as above then 1 was a harsh grade. Reading your comments some very small elements of your grammar could be improved, but it is very good - your sentences and meaning are easy to undertand, and the small errors dont impact on understanding for the reader - so unless your essay was a disaster, I do agree that the marker may have been overly critical. But don&apos;t let that change the way you have been marking. Just forget it and move on!  ;</string>
            <string>Just wondering if anyone else noticed a somewhat regular theme of red, white, and black. Off the top of my head I only remember Snow White, but I know it was mentioned in other tales as well. Is there some importance there? I pictured it perhaps being good, evil, and the spilling of blood...regular occurrences and themes in most of the tales. Would love your thoughts! ;That&apos;s an interesting take.. I hadn&apos;t thought of the heaven/hell aspect. I did notice the sets of three, and it sort of coincides with other religious themes (particularly New Testament Christianity) -- Tom Thumb coincides with the Prodigal Son, it&apos;s often &quot;the least&quot; (exp: step-daughters who are treated poorly) who end up being blessed when all is said and done, there are many example of &quot;you reap what you sow.&quot;  As these are German tales, often passed down orally, I wonder if people took some New Testament parables and re-crafted them to their own culture. When the parables were originally written, they spoke to the dominant culture of their day -- agriculture. So perhaps adding in spinsters and dark woods was a way of making them more understandable in their culture.  ;</string>
            <string>Hi Jeremy.   I just encountered this in one of the Grimm stories, &quot;The Raven&quot; and thought similarly regarding the colors red, white, and black though I pictured them as heaven, hell, and somewhere in between (purgatory?).   Another thing I noticed that may related to this is that there are a lot of mention of things in sets of 3.   Not sure yet if I can make sense of this yet.;I took this as meaning a rejection of materialism/capitalism or just plain stupidity.;I just picked up a great copy of Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland with illustrations from the library.   Did you think about getting the book from the library and using post-it notes.;I&apos;m not sure if anyone else agrees with me but I really think it would be beneficial for ALL &quot;Before you Read&quot; videos to be released now.   I want the benefit of Professor Rabkin&apos;s insight before starting a book but I can&apos;t wait for the videos to be released before reading.   For instance, I&apos;ve already started reading &quot;Dracula&quot; while I&apos;m also reading &quot;Alice..&quot; because if I have free time on certain days, I&apos;m certainly taking advantage of it to read ahead.;</string>
            <string>Get over it and try to do better next time.   Grammar checkers on the internet aren&apos;t humans so don&apos;t always trust them.   Just like another forum poster stated, this is the first time for evaluators too.   That is why you have 4-6 different critiques so you don&apos;t just take one of them as gospel.   Read all of the evaluations as a whole.;Personally I try to read all the additional stuff after reading the books so that it doesn&apos;t influence my interpretation in any way.   But then after reading the additional stuff, sometimes I wish I had this additional stuff in my head while I was reading the book as it would have aided my interpretation.   So I&apos;m not sure there is a right or wrong way.   ;Let&apos;s burn the book!!!!    No but seriously, I think this is just something that comes to you more naturally.   I&apos;m not easily offended and don&apos;t take everything as literal as you may be doing here.   There is nothing here meant to offend.   These are stories that have been passed down through generations and are from a very different time when life was much different than it is now.   Either way, there are plenty of Fantasy/Sci-fi that is written today that would offend you.   But these are just stories.   I actually found the punishment of rolling someone in a barrel stuck full of nails humorous which shows how different people are.   I didn&apos;t find it humorous because I enjoy violence or gore because I don&apos;t.   I found it humorous because it was so outlandish a punishment that it really convinced me that this is &quot;make-believe.&quot;   ;Anna, when I see lack of paragraphs among other things, the impression I get is that days reading and hours writing weren&apos;t spent.   In an internet course such as this, it&apos;s even more important to make a good impression with the essay.   I don&apos;t know anyone here.   I&apos;ve never seen anyone here at the campus library or in the classroom.   So unfortunately, the impression I get may be wrong, but I have nothing else to go by except what is in front of me.I think one need not have such a soft skin when it comes to these evaluations.   Anyway, there are multiple evaluations so if you get discouraged by one bad one out of four, let it go.   If you see all your evaluations as negative, then this should signal that you need to work harder.;The soft skin comment wasn&apos;t directed at you which was why I used &apos;one&apos; and not &apos;you&apos;.   Either way, it wasn&apos;t abuse at all.   I guess what I was trying to say was that if one were to let every negative evaluation get to them, it would just be a waste of energy.    This type of criticism should be expected from a free internet course where people can basically remain anonymous and who may not care as much about feelings as someone evaluating your essay face-to-face.;I agree with Joshua, that visual formatting is important.   For me, it is just as important as the content itself.   When evaluating essays in unit 1, there were some that had one long paragraph.   I immediately became disinterested.    This is fine if you are brainstorming or taking notes for yourself, but if this is going to be presented to the &quot;intelligent and attentive&quot; reader, I&apos;d expect more effort to be put forth.   ;I&apos;ll clarify for the anonymous poster who cowardly can&apos;t use their real name.    For me, visual formatting is just as important than content in this course where we have to evaluate multiple essays with a limited amount of time.  ;I like to complement my completion of a book sometimes by watching the movie.   I picked the 1992 movie of Dracula because frankly I can&apos;t get into the black and white. I only made it through about 45 minutes.   I found the movie similar to the book in many ways but I started to become bothered by the imagery (when Lucy is led to Dracula) when it widely conflicted with my own from the reading.   Does anyone else feel like a movie ever really complements the reading of the book?   Can you gain any more insight into a story or does it actually have a negative effect on your thought process?;Great movies to bring up because I agree with you on both. After watching GoT season 3, I want to read the books all over again. ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>I have to give you props on this one.   I agree with you.;</string>
            <string>Id suggest the red woman represents sexual promiscuity not low morals. They can be two completely different things. The red woman is often very compassionate and sweet.;I think that we are loosing out by reading such a late edition. The original fairy tales would have had a much clearer message or moral, as most stories do. I get the impression that the value of the story may have been lost in the censorship for children. The Grimm brothers were criticized in their first editions because the stories were inappropriate for children.  But if the original folklore was cruel it would be nice to read the stories that were passed through centuries and represent a culture, rather than the censored versions that meet a critic or publisher&apos;s criteria.  ;I think that stories passed through years of recounting would become more stream lined naturally, the folklore would only contain necessary details as people only remember those. I also think that Grimm brothers would not have put in something if it was pointless, they were writing a book, not merely transcribing text  ;I&apos;d like to hear people&apos;s opinions on the story Fred and Kate. Firstly this is not a story of fantasy, simply folklore, but I think that an understanding of it will help find a common thread in not only the Grimm brothers&apos; work but also Lucy Crane&apos;s version. Other editions end the story with Kate&apos;s witlessness saving her and Fred&apos;s money but in the Crane edition it goes on to have her scare away a lame man and his friend while she accidentally becomes a turnip thief? I just cannot find any justification of having this here. Would this just have been considered funny 130 years ago?  ;I like what you&apos;re saying. I do want to point out though that fantasy and unlikeliness aren&apos;t the same;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m honest enough I believe, never tried to cheat anyone in my life as far as I remember. But do you think naivety is becoming a little too common today? Gullible people annoy me and people that lack common sense. At least these fairy tales teach children not to be idiots unlike Disney... Just have faith and everything will work out is a naive message to feed a child, critical thinking though is a gift (though i do suppose maybe these stories might produce something more along the lines of distrust.   ;</string>
            <string>I could be wrong but I believe the black colour of the ravens is meant to signify the death of the brothers should the princess fail in her task.   ;I found it quite daunting too but managed it by writing down thoughts as bullet points as I went along and joining everything together in the end in hopefully somewhat coherent from. I am definitely glad I am attempting it!;</string>

On the one hand, it affirms the need for fairy tales, but on the other hand, it paints a picture of a world where fairy tales and fantasy are insignificant.What do you all think about this?;Most of us feel nostalgic when thinking about fairy tales, associating them with childhood and simpler times. It&apos;s quite funny that nostalgia for simpler times was already around when fairy tales were collected. It&apos;s probably part of the human condition. I really like it as an opening sentence as well, Rachael. By linking the story to everyone&apos;s desire for and memory of simpler times, it&apos;s way easier to become drawn into The Frog Prince.;I actually found such an interesting journal article on memory in the Grimm fairy tales that refers to this exact introductory sentence. Apparently, the Frog Prince was placed as the first story in the Household Tales in many editions. It was  given this introductory statement rather than &quot;once upon a time&quot; as a way of making the compilation&apos;s intention of invoking lost times clear.Here is the article name, author and JSTOR URL.

            <string>I was very intrigued by the use of color as allegory throughout many of the tales, and chose the topic for my first paper. Researching the meaning of the color red, in particular, provided many insights into the reading of the tales. Through studies, red has been found to be the color first perceived by infants, and even the first color recognized in patients who have suffered traumatic brain injuries that affect their visual perception. To Neolitiic peoples red was likely considered the most important color. This can be seen by their placement of red ochre in graves, and the use of the pigment in cave paintings, used to depict animals to conjure fertility and good hunting. The word &apos;magic&apos; translates to &apos;tarfur&apos; in Old Norse, and is related to the Anglo-Saxon word &apos;teafor&apos; which means &apos;red ochre.&apos;A common belief in the pre-Medieval and Medieval eras in Europe saw the color red offering protective powers against evil influence. Objects, animals and trees were covered with red pigment, and warriors painted axes, spears and catapults covered in red paint to endow the weapons with magic power. Some Australian aboriginies still follow this practice today.  Both Neolithic hunters and Germanic warriors used to paint their weapons and bodies with the blood of slain animals, and Roman gladiators drank the blood of dying adversaries to take their strength. In some cultures babies were even bathed in blood of strong, good-looking animals, so as to absorb their strength.  Red painted amulets or gems were used as charms against the &apos;evil eye,&apos; and wearing a ruby was thought to bring about invincibility against bad omens or ill health. Bed-clothing was customarily red in Germany up to the middle ages, and used as a protection against &apos;red illnesses,&apos; such as fevers, rashes and miscarriages. Garlands and scarves of the color were part of wedding customs in many areas, and indeed red veils are still worn by brides in some south-eastern European countries.  The brides were wrapped in a fiery red veil, likely used to symbolize love and fertility.  In Germany red wedding gowns were fashionable into the 18th century, but was a custom dating back to the Roman era. To this day, red is still the gown choice of color for Chinese brides, who are carried in a red litter, and walk on a red carpet. Neighbors even bring red eggs when a couple welcomes a child.  A red rose is seen as a symbol of love and fidelity. In Greek legend the red rose sprung from the blood of Adonis, and it symbolizes the cycle of growth and decay, but also love and affinity, and was dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite. In christianity it symbolizes the cross and Christ&apos;s bloodshed, and the Israelites&apos; painted their door frames with blood to scare demons away.  Even the phoenix, or firebird, was associated with cleansing and renewal, and promised good fortune and longevity. Fire, and by affinity the color red itself, was seen as giving life itself, providing both warmth and protection.In the texts we see the use of the color red as allegory for protection, or stages of trials to achieve a desired goal.  For Clever Grethel the wearing of her red heels make her feel special, and others in the village see her as feeling self-important, due to the color of the shoes. In the Death of the Hen, the bride wanted red silk in trade; and in The Three Little Men In The Woods, the finding of the red strawberries is her reward for her kindness and help.  In both The Goose Girl and Little Red Cap, we see the use of red objects as protection. The Queen offers a cloth with three drops of her blood to her daughter, and the red cap was a offering of love and protection by her mother.We see the use of red in trials in both The Raven and Faithful John. In The Raven, one of the sets of horses used to ferry her were red, and in Faithful John a red horse comes from the heavens as the first of three trials he confronts for the King. In the Six Soldiers of Fortune, the iron of the floor was turned red-hot in an attempt to kill them, but is ultimately the second of three trials they overcome to win their fortune. The red flag used in The Twelve Brothers can be seen as protection by their mother, as this is their warning signal to escape their deaths.  In Roland, the protagonist changes herself into a red milestone, a marker with which her love could find her again. Also in Snow White, we see the Queen receive her with for a child with the spilling of the thee red drops of her blood. Also the eating of the red poisoned apple, ultimately leads her to her love. Finally, the iron shoes being heated red-hot and placed on the Queen, sees the end of the threat to her life.Any thoughts on this reading of the texts?;I think that is a very relevant and interesting way of looking at the text. Especially considering the books can be read almost as a &apos;coming of age tale&apos; for Alice&apos;s character. The many correlations that can be drawn between her growing up and losing her childlike innocence, and what occurs to her throughout the book are quite clear. Her discomfort and frustration at never being the right size, and losing control of parts of her body, such as her neck, are upsetting to her. Her effort the enter the &apos;idyllic garden&apos; can represent her desire to hold on to her childhood and innocence also. The train can represent the movement ever closer to adulthood, and away from her childhood. Also, the White Knight character who comes to her aid is later forced to abandon her when she is ready to move into becoming a &apos;queen,&apos; which can also be seen as a metaphor for growing up.   I have found that as I age I look more and more into the meanings of texts, in particular from a woman&apos;s perspective.  ;</string>
            <string>Colour was something that struck me in Dracula as well, actually - everyone is forever going red with rage, or blood, or health, or white in death, in shock, in purity. The story starts at or around St. George&apos;s day, and St. George&apos;s flag is iconically red &amp; white. Black, too, features, in Dracula&apos;s heart, in the night he operates under, and so on. An interesting topic, and some great comments - thanks for sharing!;He may be a cad, but he is at least sensitive enough to feel guilt for it; your true cad barely notices. Anyway, a half formed thought about shame:I argue below that the creation of the monster is, essentially, a masturbatory act. This, in some ways, is shameful enough, but it does not entirely explain Victor&apos;s reaction to the monster. I think it&apos;s worth considering the context of the book, and in particular the rather tangled biographical details that surround its writing. I think there are parallels to be drawn between Victor, the scientist creator, and Percy Bysse Shelley, the creative poet. Not in that Shelley writes ugly poetry, but in considering the circumstances of his elopement with Mary - not, in fact, his wife in 1816, but &quot;the other woman&quot;.Shelley at that time was still married to Harriet Westbrook, with whom he had had a child in 1813. He had abandoned both to pursue other women, including the various Godwin sisters. I personally feel that Frankenstein&apos;s guilt and shame reflect, in part, something of Percy Shelley&apos;s guilt and shame at that act, and that Victor&apos;s deep misery is both sexual and parental - coded shame for a regretted sexual entanglement (one the limited biographical details on Wiki suggest Percy came to feel was &apos;beneath him&apos;) and guilt at parental abandonment. Elizabeth herself suspects Victor of having an affair, and the monster, dreadful evidence of a prior &apos;wanton&apos; liason, exacts his revenge on their wedding night - and few things are likely to spoil a bride&apos;s wedding night like the discovery of the bridegroom&apos;s bastard child.;For what it&apos;s worth, one of Percy&apos;s pen-names was Victor, and according to Wiki he spent time at university experimenting with the sciences.;I think it goes a bit deeper than teasing...! He separated from his first wife, who died shortly after the publication of Frankenstein. Looked at from the perspective of a man who recently left his child, much like Victor fleeing the monster, the books becomes even darker than it already seems. ;The gender roles is certainly a good observation. Victor is certainly trying to be god, but doing so in the only way he knows how - by mimicking (in himself) both male and female. Take the moment he, uh, comes to his breakthrough in chapter 4:....to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated...Now, I feel there&apos;s a fairly high probability an 18 year old on a romantic foreign holiday with her sexy poet husband knew perfectly well what she was writing about here, but I don&apos;t think we need to bicker about awareness to see foreplay, orgasm, and the little death. Progressive steps obliterated indeed.What&apos;s interesting, though, is the words before that: After so much time spent in painful labour...Labour, of course, being both work, and giving birth, and complicating Victor as man and as gestating woman. Throughout the creation of the monster, Victor uses labour; having inseminated himself, he must give birth. God creates man from nothing in a day; woman creates man* from man in 9 months. Poor Victor, working only with himself, labours to a two year term - and yet still is male:still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work [not labour, here] near to a conclusion....   *or woman, obviously.;Didn&apos;t occur to him along the way, didn&apos;t think about the consequences, didn&apos;t happen 5 mins earlier...You know, those absences happen a lot with teenagers and young men, except possibly for the 5 minutes earlier bit.;Interesting essay, although I think it might benefit from considering Dracula   s consummated male victims; he may rape women, but he destroys men. He kills two men that I recall, besides the crew of the ship, the retired sailor in Whitby &amp; his foreign, and thus lower class, shipping agent in Galatz, both by ripping out their throats. He is, it seems, not interested in middle class men (though those intense male friendships, with Stoker so quick to reassure us they involve nothing more than a manly pat on the shoulder...). Given the role of rent boy rough trade in the Wilde trial, destroying the evidence - as well as the symbology of destructive homosexual desire in the excessive nature of the wounds (throats torn out, as if by a wild animal, not simply bitten, yet still in the same eroticised zone) - does make a certain amount of sense. I like the point Sean made earlier about the mix up between carnal and carnivorous, but I do think there are ways to read the book without necessarily queering the Count.That said, I think that looking forward to Freud&apos;s theories of sexual development, where certain stages have to be passed through before sexuality fastens on its proper object, the opposite sex, throws an interesting light on Dracula   s sexuality. You can certainly suggest the Count&apos;s desires are not completely gendered, and Helsing repeatedly describes him as having a child brain; he is sexually transgressive; and he can change shape. In short, as Mary suggested earlier, Freud&apos;s infantile polymorphous pervert.    ;I agree, Angela! I&apos;ve actually enjoyed the book, but - even if you haven&apos;t liked it - I think it&apos;s worth listening to the Dracula lecture on words and the one on timelessness to see why it might be an important book.;Oh,  they work less these days. ;Our anonymous friend&apos;s joke can be read in (at least) two ways. One is the rather snide meaning I think you have picked out- that the working class are as inferior as ever; one is the rather more bitter observation - in line with my suggestion that the working class are disempowered in Dracula - that nothing has changed. A third interpretation is the long running (and frankly, perfectly justifiable) gag about the English &amp; our drinking habits, one Stoker&apos;s friend Wilde also made: Work is the curse of the drinking classes. Any way Anon meant it, at the least I applaud the use of the feed line.As for my joke, there&apos;s a poisonous tendency in the mainstream political and social conversation in the UK at the moment (you may be British; I don&apos;t know) to classify working class people as striving or skiving - exactly the same as the Victorian deserving or undeserving; working hard or working less. The flip side of that is, again, the bitter truth that there simply aren&apos;t many working class jobs available anymore. In my area of the UK (Newcastle) unemployment outside the middle class bastions ran at 30-40% during the 80s, when the traditional industries of the area (coal mining &amp; ship building) were gutted, &amp; it&apos;s still 20% or more in the worst hit formerly working class areas. Working less, again.For what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;d say that &quot;the working class&quot; or at least the socially disadvantaged, are openly legitimate targets in political and (public) social discourse in the UK in ways that are no longer tolerated for blacks or women - Chav, for example, if you know it, is a pretty vile term in wide use, and I already mentioned skivers. Not that I&apos;m saying there isn&apos;t equal/worse discrimination displayed in other ways against the groups that you mention, mind.Sorry to bang on about it, but given that I had just written three paragraphs about the exclusion of the working class, I had thought I&apos;d earned a slightly more charitable reading... :);The unsupervisedplay suggests they were definitely  working class - middle class children were much more circumscribed; look at Alice who must make her adventures inside her house and from a dream of running away. ;&quot;People start believing...&quot;  You mean they, the poor uncritical sheep, right, not us? Oddly, I find myself strangely uncharitable, right now, too.;Thanks for taking the time to reply, and accept my apology for being a bit grumpy today; it partly explains why I was offended by the bracketing with the kind of  us you imply, and why I didn&apos;t really appreciate being told I should factor in your encouragement, or lack of it, in my choice of topic - patronising, is how it reads.I tried a lengthy dissection, but think I am over-analysing. I see your point, although I don&apos;t wholly agree - because saying black people work less* entirely spoils the point of the joke about the working class working less. My joke was meant  to be satiric, and I&apos;m sorry that wasn&apos;t clear enough in the original post. If you still read it a different way &amp; are offended - I apologise, wholeheartedly; it&apos;s always a risk with satire. The first line was an (obviously failed, and unnecessarily snarky) attempt to try to point out how your words can be ungenerously interpreted, if someone so chose. You don&apos;t believe the stereotypes you refer to, so when you say  People... what you really mean is Other people (they) are stupid, can&apos;t think critically, and believe what they&apos;re told. Now who&apos;s making offensive generalisations? http://xkcd.com/610/ Anyway, I&apos;ll think a bit more about it; see if my ego is just up in arms at the moment. Apologies again.*edit: That is, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a balancing counter-interpretation to the overtly racist stereotype of lazy black people to give the comment any satiric edge - it&apos;s just a nasty racist comment. Consider what happens if you substitute other groups; use women or gays, and the comment quickly becomes just weird, or stupid, because those groups have different associated stereotypes.   ;It should do now - and I know exactly the problem with forums; I come across as an over-analytic lecturing bore sometimes, and God knows how that happens. Pax?(Oh, and I did understand why you read it that way - which is why I wanted to clarify);Sorry to hear that, Yoly, though I don&apos;t know if this is the best place to talk about it. If you enjoy reading the book, I wouldn&apos;t worry too much about the essay, and just concentrate on finishing the book. Most of the other books are a bit shorter, so you may find them easier to finish. I&apos;m guessing you&apos;re not a native English speaker, so you might find it a bit more challenging to get everything read and written. Just relax about it, and do what you can! I teach foreign students English, so I&apos;m very impressed you&apos;re even trying - I know a lot of my students couldn&apos;t manage it. Good luck!;Yep, excellent essay. I can see your point about lack of clarity in the thesis, and I think you could possibly have developed her redemption (it is her husband to be who stakes her in the end) but I&apos;d have probably given it 3 for form, and certainly for content. The comment about poor Georgie is an extremely astute piece of reading, and that&apos;s an elegant way of handling quotation without affecting the word count, one I&apos;ll be using in future.The essay prompted me to reconsider her name, actually. Westerner/Westenra ties in with the point you make about her somnabulism - western culture sleepwalking into danger - although that may have fallen outside the scope of your essay. The -ra, though, is interesting, since Ra is the Egyptian god of the sun, and her first name means light; I certainly think that is an example of Stoker ironising her chief characteristic, which is that everything happens to her at night (edit: just noticed a comment in another thread that her name could be read as light from the west - i.e. sunset. Much more   appropriate). More directly in line with your thesis, the etymological connection with Lucifer damns her from the start.Anyway, a successful essay. I do have a few minor quibbles - but given the storm &amp; stress going on in rest of the assignments forum, feel free to ignore them. Briefly, it&apos;s actually four men who symbolically rape her (everyone has a go - Holmwood, Seward, Van Helsing, and Morris); I&apos;m not sure about the word order in narrative Victorian determinacy (Victorian narrative determinacy, surely?); it&apos;s entendre, not ententre (brain slip, I&apos;m sure); and I think, though the meaning is clear, the grammar of the last sentence of the second last paragraph is ambiguous - the opening participle clause has no clear referent, since the two closest nouns are Stoker and her behaviour. I apologise for the nitpicking; feels faintly churlish to do it in public.   Thanks for sharing.;Here&apos;s mine; I was in a hurry, so it was shamelessly plagiarised from a post I made in The Role of Christianity, https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=413 . I think the point about physical structure is valid, given the format, and I&apos;d agree with the relevant reviewers that the conclusion is a bit weak - particular props to the reviewer who points out that I take on trust the importance of the soul; on consideration, there is something rather performatively excessive about the number of references made to the soul. There is at least one missing comma, and take a look at Sean Tobias May&apos;s essay just above for a better way of inserting quotes. In  Dracula, the primary horror of the undead state is not diet or  circumstance, but a Christian fear of damnation. Throughout the book,  the main motivation for the protagonists is the saving of souls rather  than lives.    This is evident in the events of the plot, the language and arguments  the characters use, and in how Dracula is portrayed explicitly as an  avatar of the devil, whose chief concern is the corruption of souls.  Considering Lucy   s second death, Helsing justifies it with reference to  the soul (   the soul of the poor lady  _ shall again be free   , Ch16) , and  this is instrumental in convincing Arthur to play his part - Lucy&apos;s soul  needs to be saved before it is tainted irrevocably by killing an  innocent. Likewise, Mina   s inevitable damnation is the reason the group  chase Dracula after he has left England (   The stake we play for is life  and death, or more than these   , Helsing, Ch. 25). This concern with soul  is also present in much of the dialogue. Throughout the book, all the  characters, and Helsing in particular, refer to the soul. In a telling  dialogue with Renfield, Seward discomfits Renfield with the notion of  the souls of creatures he consumes buzzing around him (   He dreads the    _burden of a soul&quot;, Harker, Ch. 20 )     and it is shortly after this that  Renfield tries to break free from Dracula   s control. Finally, the clear  connection between Dracula and the devil himself, evident in both the  descriptive language used to describe the count (hellish; diabolical),  the root of his name (Romanian: Dracul, devil) and even his pseudonym in  London (de Ville) suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul,  not the body.    While Stoker   s relationship with scepticism, faith and Christianity  is complex, the metaphysical horror of the book for its original  audience comes from the damnation forced on the victim by the murderous  appetites of undeath.Formpeer 1      Clear thesis, but the second paragraph should be split up multiple ones  to make the physical structure as organized as the logical structure.  The sentences beginning with &quot;The concern of soul&quot; (missing an &apos;s&apos;, by  the way) and &quot;Finally,&quot; both mark the beginning of related, but separate  thoughts.  peer 2     Very good essay, very well written, and the best of the five that I&apos;ve evaluated this unit.peer 3      Clear, lucid prose. I have no suggestions other than perhaps a break in  the second paragraph would aid reading on a screen. Smaller paragraphs  are easier on the eyes.peer 4      This essay is very clear and well written. The vocabulary is powerful  and has a positive impact on the reader. The only phrase I found strange  was:suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul, not the body. I  would have written it like this: Dracula  s real threat is to the soul,  not the body.  It  s something minor anyway , this essay is very clear.peer 5     Althought there are some grammar mistakes they don&apos;t impede the reading. The essay is clear and well-organised.(2)Contentpeer 1      Good thoughts that are well supported, but I thought the conclusion was  sort of weak. It essentially restates the beginning paragraph, without  any new information to enhance it. peer 2      I liked your argument, and you supported it well. You&apos;re right in that  we tend to think of how the book affects us, and not how it affected  contemporary audiences.peer 3      This was the most insightful essay I&apos;ve read yet in this course. A  clear thesis is backed up by ample evidence (though no evidence is given  that for the original audience, the idea of damnation was more horrific  than vampirism itself.) Strong writing.peer 4      I liked the argument very much. The author has given very specific  examples from the text and makes quite a compelling case. Well done!peer 5      I really like how you connect your main ideas with extracts from the  book, because it is clearer to understand. Very interesting connection  not only with Christianity, but also with Christian fears.(3 - generous, I think);Thanks for posting that quote, P. Klein. Interesting, and certainly matches themes in the 1831 edition I&apos;m reading. ;I wrestled with this issue a bit. The suggested Google edition is scanned and horribly typo&apos;d; I found it pretty unreadable. I looked at the Amazon text (which is definitely the 1818 one) but found a proofread version of the 1831 text on Gutenberg Press. This is the link:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324  and there is a mobi file available for the kindle. The introduction is quite interesting, actually, and worth reading. Shelley says she made some minor changes to the style of the first few chapters, but I don&apos;t know how significant they are. ;Just getting started, and having read through the intro and the letters, I noticed a lot of references to Coleridge&apos;s Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. The letter writer makes reference to the poem explicitly, and Vincent&apos;s role - warning Walton about the dangers he faces - is similar to that of the Mariner in the poem. I found something vaguely familiar about the iceberg scene, but couldn&apos;t quite place it, and won&apos;t have time to look at the poem until later. Just wondering if anyone has anything more concrete on the connection, or more generally on Shelley and Coleridge.Looking forward, also, I was struck by the book&apos;s relationship to A Wizard of Earthsea (by Ursula K. Le Guin, who we&apos;re reading later, and if you&apos;re doing this course and haven&apos;t read it, that should be the very first book you pick up after the course finishes). Like Frankenstein (and also with echoes of Dracula) Ged tries, hubristically, to bring forth life, or at least truly resurrect a dead person, but ends up with a monster who he then has to chase to the ends of the world. Curious echo.;In the end, I actually developed my thesis influenced by the ending of  the Wizard of Earthsea, and thinking about the importance of names, both  symbolically and as essential parts of our social identity.;I was trying to avoid spoilers,  but the (actually not quite core) story of the cloned worker is the one I was thinking of; life created without care for the life itself. ;Hello Royce! Yes, that&apos;s an interesting observation, although the nesting is more complex in Cloud Atlas. Did your friend also tell you that the monster&apos;s great great grand-daughter is hidden in the core of the book? It&apos;s worth reading if you get the chance, although I&apos;d also recommend one of his other books, Ghostwritten. The science-fictional aspects of both are fairly bleak, however!Following on from my initial observation, I&apos;ve been trying to identify some of the influences and allusions in the book, although exploring them in any depth is a hopeless task given the time constraints. I hope one of the lectures will deal with the references! Anyway, a few more:Faust (both Goethe and Marlowe) - occultists like the young Frankenstein, and archetypal investigators into things what man was not meant to wot.Shakespeare - The Tempest, in particular, Prospero (a master of magical arts who shuts himself away insolitude for study, abandoning his duties) &amp; Caliban (the monster), and Prospero and Miranda (compare the monster watching the cottagers, who, like the washed ashore characters of the Tempest, are actually nobility, made wretched, with Miranda:   How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in&apos;t!) Hamlet, the very model of the modern miserable intellectual gets a look in too, with echoes of his despair and guilt present in Victor.Paradise Lost, very obviously.Childe Harold, I am fairly sure, though it has been a long time since I read it.The romantic poets, generally, and in a host of ways - the importance of nature, imagination, and solitude being just 3 I picked out, and empathy/sympathy has just occurred to me. Austen - Mansfield park gets a specific reference (pretty Miss Mansfield...) in the letter about Justine&apos;s history, although I am unsure whether the following clause (her ugly sister Manon (Mammon) has married the banker) is a gag about what Austen&apos;s novels are about underneath the pretty surface, or a reference to another novel; Austen&apos;s domestic, tiny worlds are lightly mocked in the introduction; and there seems to be a mild anxiety of influence at play - although judging by the comments in the Drama Queen thread, it&apos;s pretty clear Austen&apos;s won that particular challenge....and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s many, many more.;Good post, John. That solitude is a key issue, and I think it&apos;s an interesting one to consider in the context of her original audience; writers &amp; romantics who laid great importance on solitude, especially in nature. A cautionary tale, perhaps?;Hello Laurie!Like Florencia, I&apos;m afraid I have quite the opposite problem! I&apos;m not quite sure if Florencia means she will be doing a close analysis of a particular incident (e.g. looking at the moment when Frankenstein &amp; the monster meet, and thinking about how this incident reflects wider themes, or discussing the marked change in language in this section) or picking out a single word (or a group of related words) and discussing how they are used throughout the book, but if you&apos;re ever stuck for ideas, these are both good approaches.Some of the ideas I&apos;ve been considering:Weather - You might look at the differences between the moments when the weather is calm, and those when it is violent. You could also consider how Frankenstein&apos;s moods are reflected in or described by the weather - he is forever raging like a storm or a whirlwind, or shrouded in a fog of despair.Nature - At the beginning of the book, Victor sees nature as something to be conquered (the root of Victor, in fact), but he becomes ever more sympathetic to nature - his moment of peace, before he meets the monster for the first time, is found in the mountains. Nature and its enjoyment was a key concept for the Romantic poets, too. Connected with that is the travelogue elements of the book - reading it, I suddenly wanted to visit the alps.Sociality vs. Solitude - Victor embraces (in many different ways...) solitude throughout the book,and especially at University, (in a city - a place reliant on social, but not familial, relationships) but the monster sees solitude as terrible. Bearing in mind the original audience, a group of poets and writers, you can see the book as a cautionary tale about Solitary Vices. Fancy &amp; the imagination- These words crop up again and again in the book, and they are words very strongly associated with the Romantic poets Shelley was involved with. There are ways you can see Victor as a frustrated poet, not a scientist. Walton, his framing parallel, tries and fails to be a poet; Victor occasionally describes what he does as art, not science; and the monster describes language as a science when he is learning it. Chimeric, a word we use now for illusion, is a reference to a fantastical monster made of many parts, and this, too, crops up a lot. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28mythology%29  Desire &amp; knowledge - For both Victor and the monster the pursuit of knowledge is highly sexualised - look at how of the word ardent/ardently/ardour (passionate) are used for their studies. I discussed this a bit in the drama queen thread already, and it connects with the themes the Professor as already drawn our attention to, about the dangers of knowledge, its sexualisation, and its connection with notions of the fall and so on. Prometheus - the subtitle is The Modern Prometheus. You might like to consider the original Prometheus myths and its variants, and the ways in which Victor does &amp; doesn&apos;t resemble Prometheus - you could even argue that aspects of the monster echo Prometheus. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus )If I have time, I&apos;ll put some observations about names up later (good spot on Felix, Florencia!) John Graham has posted some interesting things about justice, guilt, and shame, and if I was fantastically learned and had 3 weeks, I&apos;d certainly discuss literary allusion in the book - but there&apos;s much more - the relationship of parent and child, the narrative structure, the importance of the word daemon...Anyway, hope that helps! Good luck with the essay.;A bit late, but now I&apos;ve finished and fled from my Creature - maybe not hideous, but perhaps hideously boring - I&apos;d point out that you can both be right. Although I don&apos;t think the monster is  literally Satan, he certainly claims a satanic status, and Victor, while still believing himself the creator, fantasizes about throwing the monster from precipes, from cliffs - the Satanic fall. Yet by the end of the book, Victor himself identifies with Satan: Like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.;The same.I am actually an EFL teacher, so I&apos;m fairly tolerant about form, especially if I am certain the writer is a foreign student of English. It&apos;s worth noting that it is perfectly possible for a student to succeed at a university course with less than perfect English; content matters more than form for most university courses, and even English related courses do not expect native level English from students. Cambridge University, for example, asks for an 8 at IELTS (the academic English exam used for entrance to most British universities) for linguistics and literature MAs, and less for other courses. 9 is native speaker level (and some native speakers would struggle to qualify :D) - at 8, &quot;some errors do persist&quot; and the IELTS writing descriptor asks for &quot;the majority&quot; (not all) sentences to be constructed accurately. In terms of this course, it should be perfectly possible for a well structured and coherent essay from a foreign speaker to get at least a 2. That said, if it causes you as much difficulty as you suggest, 1 is the best mark.One other thing - while systematic errors like the missing -s  might be noticeable, that is not always a good guide to the seriousness of the error. The -s, in particular, along with irregular past tenses, are notoriously difficult areas for most students, and even otherwise extremely high level speakers (i.e., band 8, &amp; good enough to study English Literature at Cambridge University) sometimes make these mistakes. This is because English is irregularly and only partially inflected, and it is especially difficult for speakers from languages with virtually no inflection, like Chinese. Articles and prepositions are other areas that people often fuss about, but again, these are areas that cause all except very high level learners problems - and yet rarely detract from the meaning. A few people have talked about the difficulties of grading foreign language students. If you are genuinely interested in doing justice to non-native speaker essays (and good for you if you are!) , I&apos;d take a look at the IELTS band descriptors - http://www.ielts.org/pdf/UOBDs_WritingT2.pdf . Anything at 7 or above with a strong structure and good organisation should, in my opinion, be at least a contender for a 2.      ;...native speakers struggling to have a good score in the IELTS should tell you something about the validity of the test.Yes. It tells me that some native English speakers do not fully understand and are not able to produce university level discourse. This cannot be a complete surprise, surely..?  In the writing section,  accuracy is not the only criterion - most non-academic native writing would do less well due to lack of grammatical range, inappropriate vocabulary, and poor structure.    For what it&apos;s worth, I state explicitly that band 7 - a grade that will get you into most universities in the UK - is on the way to a 2. ;This, pretty much, given the context.;</string>
            <string>I didn&apos;t think full in-text citations  were  standard in this class. Can you point me to the course rubric that says so?Personally, I&apos;m using footnotes [1] (linked to the citations section) for both references and longer quotes simply because the word count is so tight, and, given the nature of the course, provided a writer has some consistent method of telling me where a quote comes from &amp; what material is not their own, I see no reason to insist on a particular method, inline or not. The essays themselves are  not  written for casual readers - they&apos;re written for fellow students on the course, and since they&apos;re so short, even with the citations section included, I think this method is sufficiently clear.  I agree with your point about indicating the particular text you&apos;re using, especially if it&apos;s different from the suggested one, however.  [1] Like this.  ;Very useful, Florencia - thanks for sharing. I&apos;m struggling to find a foothold in the Hawthorne; after Frankenstein, the stories seem a bit shallow. Maybe this will help!;A few other points I&apos;ve considered.First, the figure of the Artist. Hawthorne is (thumpingly) clear that the protagonist of AoB is an artist, and the work there is creation rather than modification as it is in the scientific stories. It&apos;s, significantly, the last story in the edition we&apos;re using (although only the second last in the original text, tho&apos; I need to check the relation of the version we have and the original), and there are obvious ways in which the artist&apos;s creations mirror what Hawthorne wants to do with his stories. This inter-textual, justificatory theme is there in Rappucini&apos;s daughter, too - the purported author, Aubepine, is described at length, but Aubepine is French for Hawthorn, and the titles of Aubepine&apos;s purported works (Le Voyage Celeste a Chemin de Fer = The Celestial Railroad, one of the other stories in the collection, and L&apos;Artiste du Beau ou le Papillon Mecanique is also very plain). In both these stories, Hawthorne is telling us how to read his stories, and there may be other similar moments in the other stories.Time (&amp; Life/Death) Certainly in RD &amp; AoB, time vs timelessness is both thematic and symbolised. In RD, there&apos;s a detail about a statue the god vertumnus - Roman god of plants &amp; also seasons -   being overgrown suggesting, to me at least, that the garden is a little outside the flow of time. Only intrusion into the garden brings time with it - and, although I haven&apos;t fully thought it through, I think it&apos;s important that the plants are blooming rather than fruiting (i.e. pre generative). Flowers are certainly a symbol of evanescence, something they share with butterflies. In AoB, however, the time theme is made very clear, and there&apos;s something paradoxical in the notion of a mechanical (not mortal) butterfly - and it is destroyed by the baby, whose link with time is also explicit.Connecting those, it&apos;s also worth noting Hawthorne was explicitly interested in creating a mythology for the US. I think back to the lecture on time in Dracula and the different kinds of timelessness (eval time and mythic time) an artist or story can aspire to. Both AoD &amp; RD resemble fairy tales, and represent a play for the mythic time - that is, archetypal, and beyond the date of their composition. This is especially true in the structure of RD where we have a beautiful woman, a handsome prince, and so on, as well as the echoes of Rapunzel in the name, the garden (Rapunzel begins with the wife&apos;s craving for the witch&apos;s plants) and what seems an inversion to me of the structure - the man looking down and descending, instead of looking up and ascending. For what it&apos;s worth, the fineness of a watchmaker&apos;s work as well as the opposition of wit and brawn in AoB also remind me of the tailor character in fairy tales. ;@Florencia. I&apos;m honestly not sure, but I mean the sound of the name; I hear both as beginning /Ra.puh/.(that is, schwa) though one is /Ra.&apos;puhn.zel/ and the other /Ra.puh.&apos;chee.nee/, and I&apos;m not completely sure about the stress on Rapaccini. Not exactly p;Excellent! Don&apos;t know why it didn&apos;t occur to me to google them myself - and it&apos;s certainly nothing to be ashamed of.;Oh, and on reaching the end of the story again, I noticed that Prof B. announces Rapaccini! Rappacini! ;  I like it, although Beatrice is never actually known - a meaning of known the professor doesn&apos;t mention in the lecture...;One other tidbit I discovered, during time that might have been better spent writing the essay, was that Eugene Sue, mentioned in the introduction to the story, is - according to wiki - the source for the maxim  Revenge is a dish best served cold. How&apos;s THAT for the upshot of the experiment?   ;It&apos;s possible peer 1 picked up on a couple of the minor flaws, although - without examples - it&apos;s equally possible they were talking through their hat; it&apos;s a full &amp; interesting essay, one that would certainly have got 3 for content from me.Form:Overall your English is extremely good, but there are a couple of nitpicks; none detract from the meaning.In     Wretch    the noun  &amp;     wretched    the adjective, I think you would be better off using commas, since you are giving additional, non-determining, information (as in relative clauses).For  as the wretched, my instinct is you either need a noun (one) or no the, but I can see the parallelism you were trying for.Up to the first half  should be  in the first half or up to the end of the first half, since up to implies a point.For style, I&apos;d agree with peer 2 that you handle the informal style very well, although I would warn you it&apos;s a risky gambit in academic writing - some of the more, uh, demanding reviewers might take issue with it. Connected with that, I would definitely avoid using And  or But  to begin sentences; I think usage is shifting, but in general, this is discouraged in academic writing. Content:  I picked out wretch as a key term, and I think you do a good job of describing its importance. To develop your point, you might like to consider its connection in sound and spelling to wreck, another term which appears frequently in  Frankenstein, as verb, noun, and adjective. The two words in fact share a root, the Old English wreccan - which means, suggestively, to exile or drive out, and links to wreak, as in wreak vengeance.  If you&apos;re interested in focusing on words, I&apos;d highly recommend   http://www.etymonline.com/index.php  ; it&apos;s very useful, and an acceptable source for citation  -   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Etymology_DictionaryI think you could also have usefully added that Frankenstein falls to  the wretched  state, a connection with the Satanic themes of the book.;Oh, one other point - demon is the evil one, but daemon  is a bit more complex. Exercise left for the reader :);Mine - a bit limited in some ways, and I missed the opportunity to use the word  patronymic, the broader connection between irony and the reversals of the book (Victor&apos;s move from creator to Satan), and the neat closing gag about the Monster taking Frankenstein&apos;s name in popular imagination. Nobody commented on the slightly awkward use of transgress, or  what I see as the  biggest flaws, the over-use of irony &amp;  the lack of development in the last paragraph. I&apos;d also  have liked to expound a bit on Waldman, who also has phonic &amp; archetypal  echoes - in his concern with fame and his rationalist willingness to accept the value of even occult knowledge -  of the allegorical character, Mr. Worldly. Anyway, my lumbering monster:EssayAdam   s first duty was to name the creatures of the world, and naming is always a powerful act. The names in  Frankenstein  serve symbolic and ironizing purposes, but also suggest the wider significance of naming itself.  Victor, for example, means conqueror [1], and to conquer is to trangress the borders of one   s own country and those of another. This is what Victor wishes     to exceed the boundaries of the mortal, and trespass in God   s realm. However, the name is ironized by the events of the novel, with Victor conquered by the monster, and, as with any conquered person, enslaved [2]. This is echoed in the etymology of his surname, with  Frank  originally meaning free[3].  Other characters also have symbolic, ironized names. Elizabeth is    promised to God   [4] and she is sworn to Victor, an aspiring creator, from an early age, but, as with nuns promised to God, she is virginal when the monster murders her. Justine, derived from justice, receives no such thing. Even minor characters are named in suggestive or ironic ways.  Wald  is German for forest, where characters get lost, and it is Waldman who &quot;smoothed the path of knowledge&quot;[5] for Victor   s dangerous endeavours. Felix, happiness, is described by the monster as a model of familial, and, once Safie arrives, social happiness, and then bitterly ironised when the monster frames Justine. [6]  Yet, besides these symbolic echoes, names also serve an essential purpose of identification. Familial relationships are described by names, and personal names are given to us by our parents to identify us within the family and to the wider world[7]; without names, we cannot fully function in society. Though Victor calls his creature devil, fiend, and monster, he will not do his fatherly duty and acknowledge their relationship, or give the monster a name. That namelessness, and the lack of social identity it implies, is itself a symbol of the dreadful solitude to which the monster feels condemned.

Very cool topic! Definitely the most unique essay I read for this assignment. Keep up the good work!peer 3      I found your thoughts on the significance of the names in the essay intriguing. You did not deliver a sound thesis, though. More precisely, if your thesis is that the names Shelley choose for her characters have significance, the same could be said of any author&apos;s work.  //Not having read every book in the world, I can&apos;t really comment on this, except to note that simple significance was not the  whole  of my thesis.peer 4      I would like to have grade it 2.5, if we had that option. Spelling mistakes prevented the 3.  //There are none that I can see; the worst I can be accused of is dropping my fake American accent after the second paragraph.peer 5      the evidence is perssuasive, the thesis are excellent, the name give us identity, I am agree, but is the essential factor in the novel?//This is actually a good point, but I wanted specifically to demonstrate  - and again with reference to Peer 3 -   why (and, in my presumption, how)  readers should consider names, rather than necessarily  making a central point about  Frankenstein.(3);Well, thank you very much, Theodossia! You&apos;re clearly someone of great personal style &amp; judgement. Incidentally, in your comment, you mentioned the notion of people&apos;s name indicating their characters &amp; fates in real life - it&apos;s actually called nominative determinism in English, and there&apos;s a good example on the wiki page  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_determinism  ), from Jung:&quot;Herr Freud (Joy) champions the pleasure principle, Herr Adler (Eagle) the will to power, Herr Jung (Young) the idea of rebirth  _&quot;... And thanks again for the positive feedback!;On exactly that topic, there&apos;s a devastating analysis of how problematic Ender&apos;s innocent invulnerability is in this essay: http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tenshi/Killer_000.htmHeavy spoilers, obviously, but an interesting read, and an interesting example of how to lit-crit sci-fi.;Nice observations. ;very good. ;Having missed the deadline, I&apos;ll begin, two days early - just finished it, so might as well post. My topic turned out to be a little more complex and, I think, a little less central than I imagined, but never mind. Curious to know if anyone else considered narrative voice in the other Hawthorne stories, L&apos;Artiste du Beau in particular. Essay Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter is a story about many things, but our understanding of it and our ability to pull a single meaning from the tale is complicated even further by the unreliable narrative voice.   The story begins with an introduction in which a narrator claims the story was actually written by one Aubepine (French for hawthorn), and whose book titles closely mirror Hawthorne&apos;s other stories in the collection[1], yet this sets up a confusion. If Aubepine is a figure for Hawthorne, who, then, has translated the story into English and written this deprecating introduction describing his works as    wearisome    and without    human warmth   ?   Within the tale itself, the narrator     either Aubepine or the purported translator    makes several obvious platitudinous interjections, signalled by a switch to the present tense, and is very keen to tell us how to assess the characters. However, his first direct interjection [2] is shown to be wrong through the later events of the tale     the influence of morning does not change the fact of Beatrice&apos;s poison; Giovanni was correct in his first impression. His second interjection [3] notes that both dark and light emotions have their place, but it is the mixture that is problematic. It is hard, however, to see horror as a blessed emotion.  What&apos;s more, this intensely binary view contradicts the portrayal of Beatrice as a mixture     both animal and vegetable, both unquestionably good and unquestionably deadly. Nor, despite the narrator&apos;s frequent assertions that she is an    angel   , is Beatrice herself entirely guiltless. She is happy enough to take Giovanni&apos;s affection, despite knowing that it cannot be consummated [4]. Our narrator, who is very clear about Giovanni&apos;s failures, is silent on this.     By removing authorial authority and then complicating the narrative voice itself, Hawthorne forces us to take a more sophisticated reader&apos;s eye to the story. What is apparently an allegory or an allusive fairy-tale begins to look a more human confusion of misinterpretation, motive, and meaning.   [1]  For example, L&apos;Artiste du Beau . [2] But there is an influence in the light of morning that tends to rectify whatever errors of fancy, or even of judgement, we may have incurred during the sun&apos;s decline... [3]Blessed are all simple emotions, be they dark or bright! It is the lurid intermixture of the two that produces the illuminating blaze of the infernal regions.   [4] I dreamed only to love thee, and be with thee a little time, and so to let thee pass away, leaving but thine image in mine heart   ;And thank you for your kind remarks; glad you liked it. I worry a bit about how interesting other people might find very focused topics, but unreliable narrators have been a theme of the course. I hope you&apos;ll post your essay, too, once the evaluation is over. I had trouble (despite making a lot of notes on Rappaccini&apos;s daughter) persuading the various images and allusions to cohere, as well as with the narrator&apos;s antipathy to Giovanni - who, after all, is only a lonely young man prey to the urges of all young men; not too dissimilar to Beatrice, in fact.Research is a bit flattering though - my google fu is strong, nothing more. :);Depends, I would say. If the essay is clear in the links to the stories we did read, consider giving them a 2. Otherwise, I suppose you would have to give them a one - but explain why you did so in the comments.;Yes - none for me this week, since I didn&apos;t submit in time - but I can imagine. Pessimistically, over-reliance on stories we weren&apos;t asked to read is probably grounds for a careful plagiarism check, too.;I agree with Emma,  though I would broaden the cultural claim to at least the English language,  and in outline, virtually all of Europe. The Bible is the one text almost every pre 20th century literate English speaking person would have read,  probably multiple times,  and a majority of people, literate or not,  would have had to listen to interpretation of texts from the bible at least once a week. What&apos;s more,  the bible in English - and the King James bible in particular - has had a direct effect on the diction of the language itself.  Comparisons to other works are potentially valid, although run the risk of irrelevance. Because of its centrality to pre-twentieth c cultural development,  the bible is almost never irrelevant - and the act of criticism itself owes enormously to traditions of biblical exegesis.   @ anon, I don&apos;t know what part of the world you come from,  but getting a nodding acquaintance with key stories in the bible (and preferably the King James) will help enormously in understanding some aspects of pre and early modern English literature.;apologies  for the awful formatting; tech not playing nice. ;No,  the mythological stores are also important, but come from different sources,  mostly Greek via the Romans. Robert Grave&apos;s The Greek Myths offers reasonable retelling of most of them,  but his interpretations are very questionable . Unlike the bible,  there&apos;s no single retelling that is absolutely essential; Wikipedia,  however,  will give you the general idea of most of the stories, and a translation of Ovid&apos;s metamorphoses will give you something a bit closer to the original. You&apos;ll be able to find plenty of children&apos;s versions I&apos;m sure,  but they often tend to skip the death and sex.  Don&apos;t try and read the whole of the bible,  mind,  unless you&apos;re really keen - it&apos;s a tough slog -  and if it does get too much,  again Wikipedia or children&apos;s versions will give you the general idea. There&apos;s plenty of free modernised versions of the bible online,  too.;Yep - your analogy makes it clear, Florencia. I also noted in another thread that using stories outside the course possibly warrants, depressingly, a careful plagiarism check, since a cut-out-and-keep essay is less likely to focus on exactly the stories suggested.That said, Masque of the Red Death is one of the Poe stories. It&apos;s heavily anthologized, and I think fairly widely known. It&apos;s also pretty good; put it on the reading list for the end of the course, maybe?;</string>
            <string>I have to say, I largely agree - Wikipedia is an invaluable resource, used wisely, &amp; it seems a little dishonest to me to refer to a source you haven&apos;t read, even if it&apos;s the origin of the Wiki information. ;Thanks for the informative comments on Wiki, Anon! AFAIK, the areas we are likely to be looking at are generally a bit less contentious - but thanks again for the reminder.;Yes - that was more or less my thought.  ;Nice observation. In the country of the blind, the religion &amp; belief system of the blind is presented as perfectly logical within the limits of their four senses, but also completely wrong; they believe birds (which they cannot perceive) to be angels, and they fall back to the ancient belief that the sky is basically a ceiling. ;Man is the tool using and making animal,  and for that,  our sensitive fingers &amp;  thumbs are invaluable. Moreau states explicitly he has problems with the hands, and I think there are (at least) two aspects to it Wells want us to notice - the importance of hands for manipulation,  for making (surgery),  as a sign of the human, as well as the proto religious instinct which identifies Moreau as the maker and so divine image - where the closer you get to the form of the visible god,  obviously, the more enlightened you are. ;Thanks for the reminder; while I agree with you about comparative biology &amp; wasn&apos;t perhaps clear enough in saying Wells wants us to notice this rather than necessarily believe it, I think we can agree that for most readers the statement man is the tool using animal (which a quick google tells me comes from Thomas Carlyle - the potted bio is intriguingly relevant http://quotationsbook.com/quotes/author/1322/ ) is - even now - superficially convincing, while Humans, along with octopi, chimps, bonobos, some kinds of birds, and possibly a few others, are the tool using animals lacks a certain man-on-the-street snap. I certainly think that there&apos;s at least some difference of magnitude of in the tool use, too; the connection with tool making is also to do with some of the racist/colonial themes of the book - it was a staple of the British Imperial mindset that the inferiority of other races was evidenced in their inferior tools; the tools may have been perfectly adequate for the situation, but the fact that other peoples had not developed, e.g., the revolver, was proof positive of their inferiority. I think I might I agree with your point about religion, though I may have misunderstood what you&apos;re getting at, and I&apos;m not so sure about your argument. I was posting in a hurry, and just describing the theme - but images of the divine really are often very strongly anthropomorphised (and I don&apos;t think sticking an animal head on top really cuts it to get away from that - tho&apos; in the context of Victiorian Egyptomania, it&apos;s a possibly relevant connection) - Giants in Norse myth are humanoid; Dionysus is described as a (very pretty) adolescent; against Ganesh, you can put Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva etc - again, a few extra arms neither here nor there. With the exceptions of the dragons, virtually the entire Chinese pantheon is explicitly anthropomorphic (as in heaven, so on earth) and, living in Asia, I can assure you that Buddhism the religion rather than Buddhism the philosophy is very keen on the human image; it&apos;s not 30 foot lotus flowers or a big hole that make the centrepiece of Buddhist temples, generally. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s because they think the human form is irrelevant to notions of the divine.Comparative religion aside, I agree that the satire is primarily shaped by Christian notions; the Maker; the Law; the fathering/creation aspect of it. I can&apos;t remember if the text talks explicitly about how the beast men treat the different number of fingers, but the creature (is he a gorilla? I only remember him being described as &quot;monkey&quot;) who counts the narrator&apos;s fingers is concerned with status - isn&apos;t he the one who adopts the narrator&apos;s &quot;Big Thinks&quot;? Wells draws an explicit comparison to priest talk later in the book. More broadly, however, I don&apos;t think Wells is singling out Christianity, beyond the fact that&apos;s what he knew; underlying the book is a bleak, mechanistic universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for any god at all. The narrator states towards the end, just before Moreau (the god figure) dies:A blind fate, a vast pitiless Mechanism seemed to cut and shape the fabric of existence...and the epilogue suggests he never really gets away from that.Interesting you mention Lovecraft, though - my note for that quote simply says  Lovecraft. ;</string>
            <string>Well I think the cat and mouse story is about not to put too much trust to anyone or anything and pay attention to the detail.    However, when I finish reading the story, I also got the impression that the cat, mouse and church are kind of describe the present day economic cycle. The cat is the corporation, mouse is the worker and church is the financial institution. This is just my thought of course.  ;What strike me the most in this story is the color of the pond and the situation in it changes with every wishes the fisherman do for his wife. It&apos;s like the color changes presenting the greed in human heart. The more one&apos;s wants, the more corrupt one&apos;s heart will be.;</string>

            <string>To OP, by any odd chance, did you evaluate my essay? I wrote about this Harry Potter and Dracula thingy :p  ;</string>
            <string>Anyone noticed about how the number three keeps popping up throughout this book?   Many events happen three times and the words three or third are dotted throughout this book.   I know that there is one of those numbers which have significance in many cultures and in science.   But, what do you make of it in the context of this book?;What a great discussion.    Some great points  were being made while I slept.   A great thing to wake up to.   I finished the book in bed last night and something kept jumping  out at me;   and that was-   the several mentions of three drops of blood.  ;</string>
            <string>Victoria,I came to the forum to ask that exact question. I&apos;m aware of three carrying the religious significance of the father, son and the holy ghost and having other unique &quot;properties&quot; in   magical and mathematical context, but I, too, am curious about the number&apos;s role in storytelling. So much in these fairy tales occurs in threes, that it leads me to wonder if there is something inherently more satisfying for the storyteller and reader when something is not once, not twice, but three times. Do we just prefer the rhythm it creates? Very curious.;I see what you&apos;re saying, Marla, and I suppose that&apos;s true, but what has really struck me isn&apos;t just that 3 is a popular number for characters, but it is also predominately the number of times an action is repeated or an event occurs. Almost as if an event only happened once, it wouldn&apos;t be significant; twice could be a coincidence; four times is overkill     but 3! That&apos;s the perfect number to convey significance.;Martha, that is great insight! Really helpful. That makes excellent sense to me and helps explain why we would intuitively find patterns of three more interesting than others. Great stuff!;I&apos;ve been struck by the number of stories that involve the characters finding a lonely, often abandoned house in the deep, dark woods where they are able to find refuge and respite. Often, the characters are fleeing danger in the &quot;real&quot; world outside the woods. &quot;The 12 Brothers&quot; is an example. &quot;Snow White&quot; is another. Inevitably, the outside world finds them and their peaceful existence is disrupted.The exception seems to be &quot;Hansel and Grethel&quot; where the house appears to offer them relief from their hunger but is really just a sweet trap.;I know this is last minute, but that&apos;s how I do things, I suppose. I&apos;m still knocking around in my head which essay theme to pursue and it occurred to me that many, many of these tales hinge on a barter that goes bad in some fashion. Sometimes, it&apos;s a trade in which one of the characters clearly gets the upper hand; other times, the swap is a chance for the reader to laugh at the poor trading skills of a character; and then there are the cheats who somehow squelch on a trade.It&apos;d be safe to say that bartering and trading were essential and commonplace back when these stories were popular, wouldn&apos;t it?;Professor Rabkin knows more than I do probably on almost anything, but after hearing his lecture on &quot;Hansel and Grethel,&quot; I have to cry foul to his use of back story. His foundation for arguing that Grethel had an illicit desire to kill and supplant her mother is shaky at best. More than that, though, the back story angle is out of bounds, I think. Should I be able to add back story to any character in a story in order to buttress my argument? It would certainly make things easier at times. It&apos;s not using the text to make your case and it seems like an illegitimate move to me.;I understand the Freudian critique and while I&apos;m not sold on it, I won&apos;t argue its legitimacy as an analysis technique. But the back story bit? I don&apos;t know. That seems to me a stretch too far beyond the text.;Well, that&apos;s true, every story does have an implicit or explicit backstory. I think extrapolating backward, however, wades too far into speculative waters and the farther back you go the deeper it gets. You seem up to speed on this sort of thing, Greg. Is employing backstory a common literary analysis technique?;I found this really helpful insight, Deborah. Thanks!;</string>
            <string>Emma, your posts here are the clearest, most thoughtful I&apos;ve read in this forum on why I&apos;m taking this course. You say &quot;you wouldn&apos;t like me when I talk politics and education,&quot; but I have a feeling I&apos;d like you just fine! Well done!;I am absolutely loving the wordplay in the books.

            <string>I thought I new the story but had never read it. I&apos;m so glad I did. I loved it. I have to admit I was surprised by how absolutely creepy it was and at times really horrifying. I suppose I expected it to be somewhat less sophisticated horror, but those three sisters? Yeesh! Creee-py.;Best advice I can give: Keep it simple. Keep it clear. Many of the essays I&apos;ve read strive to sound scholarly and become convoluted and confusing as a result. Close the thesaurus and just write your idea simply and clearly. You don&apos;t have to sound like some  prof.;I actually wrote my essay on how Stoker uses humor to enliven many of the characters, including Van Helsing. I thought it was a laugh when Van Helsing needs to transfuse Lucy&apos;s blood   and her unwitting fiancee Arthur Holmstead says, &quot;My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her.&quot; Van Helsing replies: &quot;My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the last!&quot; I thought that was pretty funny.;</string>
            <string>I also was struck by the similarities. Another one that stood out to me was the similar roles of Renfield and Wormtail as servants of the dark lord.;Hi, Florencia,The similarity rests, I suppose, in the nature of each character&apos;s relationship with their &quot;master,&quot; which I would characterize as groveling, subservient and founded on fear. You mention that Renfield venerates Dracula; I would say Wormtail venerates Voldemort as well. I believe both characters are drawn by the power the master possesses because it is a power they do not have and of which they are envious. The specifics you detail I&apos;m not sure are important in arguing a similarity. If all those details lined up, the characters would be mirrors of one another, and I&apos;m not suggesting that.;I absolutely began developing this thought. With the exception of Walton at the end, NO ONE reports seeing the monster and I became increasingly suspicious as Frankenstein refused to tell anyone about what he had done. I found his excuses unconvincing. Walton witnessing the monster, however, is a problem with the theory. I just don&apos;t see his motivation to concoct seeing the monster at Frankenstein&apos;s bedside. I was disappointed when that happened because I really found appealing the idea that the monster was Frankenstein, who turned out to be possibly the only protagonist I have ever completely despised.;</string>
            <string>This has become one of my favorite stories. I adored it. And Hawthorne says in the his final sentence all I need keep in mind: &quot;When the artist rose high enough to achieve the beautiful, the symbol by which he made it perceptible to mortal senses became of little value in his eyes while his spirit possessed itself in the enjoyment of the reality.&quot; His pursuit was never about anything practical; it was about pure spirit. And I love that.;</string>
            <string>I meant to ask if someone could help point out the grammatical errors and misspellings in my essay. I&apos;ve re-read it a couple times I&apos;m not sure what the reviewers caught that I&apos;m missing. Thanks!Science is suspect in early 19th-century literature as evidenced by Mary Shelley   s Frankenstein (1818) and Nathaniel Hawthorne   s short stories    The Birthmark    and    Rappaccini   s Daughter,    which appear in Mosses from an Old Manse (1846). The point of suspicion originates not in the pursuit of science itself, however, but in a deep fear of an obsessive, all-consuming pursuit of science that pays little if any heed to consequences. Both Shelley and Hawthorne paint portraits of scientists whose total absorption in their scientific work leads to dire unintended results: Shelley   s Frankenstein produces a monster while Hawthorne   s Aylmer murders his beloved and Rappaccini slays his daughter. Indeed, Hawthorne writes that Rappaccini    cares more for science than for mankind    and describes Aylmer as having a    love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy.     Obsession, Shelley and Hawthorne seem to argue, is a path to tragic and horrific ends.  But Hawthorne reveals a bias when in his story    The Artist of the Beautiful     he depicts an artist   s peculiar obsession with    putting spirit into machinery    as producing an instance of beauty, thereby transforming a dangerously obsessive preoccupation into a noble and artistic pursuit. Hawthorne characterizes Owen Warland   s obsessed personality as    being of thought, imagination, and keenest sensibility.        Hawthorne is clear. When driven by a singularly focussed passion and curiosity without concern for consequence, the scientist risks engendering death and disaster; in fact, creating the antithesis of beauty. In    The Birthmark,    it is Aylmer   s attempt through scientific methods to produce ideal beauty that leads to the death of Georgiana. In contrast, the artist driven by a singularly focussed passion and curiosity without concern for consequence can    create the beautiful.    The compulsion and drive may be the same for the scientist and the artist, Hawthorne appears to conclude, but only one pursuit has the power to produce a true representation of beauty.      Form  peer 1     Good essay with some grammatical errors. I am confused by the free-floating sentence in the middle of the essay.

I rarely score a &quot;3,&quot; but you deserve it!  peer 5     You work is well-structured and quotes are well used, but there is some misspellings.      Content  peer 1     I, as well, agree that Hawthorne and Shelley share many similarities but wonder why you chose a previous week&apos;s reading instead of Poe to discuss. Even removing Shelley completely from his essay would have given you more room to focus on Hawthorne and your ideas which are based well.  peer 3     The only changes I would have made, would have been to leave the citations to the end of the essay (we were instructed to assume our fellow classmates would understand what we were talking about) and to include more examples from Shelley to counterpoint your examples from Hawthorne.  peer 4     I think you had some interesting insights. My only suggestion would be to narrow it down more since it is such a short essay (rather than talk about too many pieces of literature).  peer 5     The connection between Mary Shelley&apos;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Hawthorne&apos;s tales shows how the style and the opnion about technical development progresses throughout the nineteenth century.

Florencia, the title was italicized in the original submission but the formatting didn&apos;t carry over when I pasted it in the forum.

Of course, 12 is the number of the tribes of Israel and the disciples of Christ.   I&apos;ve heard, less frequently than the previous examples, that four is used to represent mankind (3 [God]  +1).

            <string>I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s true that there must be an intrinsic difference. Perhaps in one case there is a person, school, or other social network that provides just enough support or opportunity for a person to make a positive choice instead of a negative one. Perhaps up until that horrific event, one person had love and support and the other a less supportive environment. I would suggest that in most cases, nurture will exert a powerful force on the outcome of a person&apos;s life.;</string>

Enjoy your comment and perspective about the magic having no ontological inertia.

It stood out to me.;I have known examples of your last point...grin.;That concept of the husband being unable to manage his relationship with his wife is a recurring theme. I think that maybe the punishment for not doing that in the end is the unhappiness they share. I am old married man and I don&apos;t think a different wife is ever a solution you want to seek. So instead of a different wife I think that point may represent that there are times, especially then, when you had no choice. The representation would be a person with no say who fails to manage his relationship with his wife which leads to some unpleasant outcome. Imagine the mindset of that wife after she had seen the best of life to be reduced again to poverty. So the message to me is men take control of your life/household (The Gallant Tailor) or the outcome will not be to your liking.;I could feel the 1950&apos;s in this book and can&apos;t help but feel we have made progress as a society.

            <string>The feminists aspects mentioned above were part of the overall battle between old world and new. The old world is represent by Dracula, individualism, and a lack of Gods (which may have been besides the point since D is represented as the Devil). The new world is team work, science, modern transportation, social economic status to deal with society (know how and position to be able to exercise freedom working within the society). I haven&apos;t gone back to specifically check this but I suspect every time she uses her intelligence to move the plot along, she is specifically mentioned as having a wonderful &quot;man brain&quot;. This change or recognition in women, even cloaked in the social norms of that day, is feminism.;I&apos;m not saying that wasn&apos;t sexist or that our view of their world would be sexist, racist, and the list could go on. I believe that it was meant more of a contrast with three different types of versions of females, the aristocratic but has some failings, the sexual as in all the vampires (love that Van Helsing was thinking about it), and then Mina as the new and idealized female. Her only sexual acts was compassionately based not biological. She was active and given key roles when using her man or modern brain. It might just be plot fluff but she did have an active role even as a supporting character. I agree that this is not good feminism at all. I think in this book there is a strong correlation between women, sex, and death. Thanks for the response it is appreciated.;</string>
            <string>I stopped reading a bit ago because I actually don&apos;t think it does any of us good. I think your first point can even be show that (I&apos;m old with a lovely memory) in that it was the working men who spoke in dialect. I think you can even draw relationships between the working class in England and the East European peasants. I actually like that they acted on their superstition. If Johnathan Harker, our modern man, had even the slightest sense of this necessary survival instinct, he never would have gone to the castle. My interpretation of this is that it pertains more to how the working class is viewed by the aristocracy. It could be a satire of sorts but it actually how life works. My best friend is a locksmith and I can tell you that this is how the world operates.There has been some wonderful discussions drawing this conclusion better. I wrote this as a battle between the isolated individual representative of the older gods versus modern, voluntary association, Christian world. Just one view.As to the trolling, take an intro-psych class (Dr. Joorden&apos;s gets some love here) and you will see we have much more in common then differences. ;I look at this as more of a plot construction. What was the monster asking for except civility and companionship? I suspect that if Frankenstein had tried an approach where he personally befriended and engaged the monster things might have been different. So possibly the theme of selfish-vrs-selfless might have been the point. I also found the monster more engaging then the good doctor.;On vacation and finishing &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; where being one of a kind in a universe is present theme. Enjoyed the perspective and also how themes really seem to be evolving on this story on these forums. Especially since I felt the way Constance did half-way through the book.;In this story there are representations of a variety of types of love. There seems to be only one representation of consumate love and that is between Felix and Safie. The observation of this motivates the monster. There are examples of empty love, where there is only commitment and no intimacy. There are examples of compasionate love but Frankenstein never shares his secret (except the magistrate) and thus never has intimacy until the end. Even when intimacy is present, other aspects of love necessary to evolve relationships are not present. There have been a number of comments on the forums regarding Mary Shelly&apos;s age (18), her relationships with parents (mother died, father disowned), and of course her relationship with her husband (eventual). All of these seem to be about love and what was lacking in relationships she was experiencing. ;Thank you for your responses and enjoyed the different views. I do see that this was a novel of ideas and can   see the religious interpretation, especially in her time. I struggled more with this story then any other since it seemed to me to have this underlying psychological feel to it. This lead me to wonder if in her life at 18, she herself might have felt the absence of   compassionate love, which was reflected in our protagonist inabilities to be intimate with those he loved.;He was certainly more engaged with both. I always wondered about this marrying someone who was like a sister. Possibly revolting against his father&apos;s long term plan for his marriage. It still seems like a cultural violation to marry someone from within the family even if they genetically different. Hard to tell if this would have been the problem for his time that it would be for me in this era. ;Take Woodie Allen as an example of this and the cultural reaction to his marriage was very negative in my social network. Sorry thought of it after the above post. Now when my friends talk of him, the discussion is just limited to his art and avoids his personal life.;I felt that there was a possible mental instability but dropped that at book II stage. I believe you have a interesting supportable theory. Is it possible that even Anna&apos;s point above could have been Victor instead of the monster? ;The thesis gives me an organizing principal. Outlines help me also. My tendency is to cram too much into a little space sometimes loosing the reader. A thesis, outline, and a few revisions are helping me get better I hope...grin.;</string>
            <string>Does he have or was there in that time a particular fear of entombment? There are a lot of you out there with much more expertise then me so I thought I would ask. I see him using what must of been cutting edge science with this twist of dread. Appreciate your thoughts.;Possibly the Entombment of Christ by Carviaggio (sp?) or even the religious aspect. Found an interesting remark where entombment was considered the most monumental of all forms of burial. Yet this fear entombment is used. Haven&apos;t ever read him in this fashion and enjoying his virtuosity.;http://www.google.com/#q=the+entombment+of+christ+caravaggio&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAGOovnz8BQMDAy8HixKnf...Caravaggio was noted for the dark styling of his painting. Working the color contrast as Poe does.;Didn&apos;t know about the Mom. Thank you for your comment. As a proliferate writer you know he was thinking. Last night I was wondering if this is part of the class issues of the Romantic Age writers? Monuments being for the wealthy such as in House of Usher, and The Raven. contrasted to those death&apos;s by consummation.   Mother issues are big though.;Thanks. That fear shows in quite a few stories and poems. I had a feeling there had to be something like that but never found any reference. The man was such a master I wasn&apos;t quite sure if that was real or a plot device.;From intro-psych, take that as a limiting factor, his behavior in those instances struck me as sociopathic, or lacking the ability to consider others feelings. I think you got it when you mentioned hyper-sensitivity. I was considering something along these lines as I see him as the Anti-Romantic. He takes all the romantics tricks and twist them all kind of perversely. Akin   to the movie &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, the different cultures deliver the same dish differently. ;</string>
            <string>You say tomato I say tomato. As a former teacher I enjoy the structure. I have and am learning in this course. What I have enjoyed is the overlay of earlier (Greek Myth) courses. I look at it like a toolbox and I have and understand much more now. Looking forward to the rest. I read ahead a bit (time management) but the books I read are later. Just joining the crowd of folks enjoying this class.;Of the courses William mentioned above I highly recommend the Greek and Roman Myth class. Dr. Struck is a gifted teacher. I enjoyed the &quot;Know they self&quot;..intro philosphy class but not sure the above is the same. The Intro psych class was excellent with Dr. Joorden. I cut back some classes and will be doing just 3 (4 at most) now. Lots of time lots of things to learn.;This man is funny. Slapstick humor and sly commentaries. ;This will more then likely be the focus of this weeks paper. Off the top of my head a few of the many lines I loved are...Mrs. Hall..&quot;In wifely opposition...&quot; I loved...(parapharasing) &quot;In the great Anglo-Saxon parliamentary tradition there was much discussion and no action.&quot; and I loved the sidekick saying &quot;Tell us something we don&apos;t know.&quot; when the invisible man was explaining he was invisible. Just got to the part that Scott referred to above. This is the first reading that is just plain funny...so far.;I think he also loved the English people. In the story who actually comes out the best? Marvel, the least comes out the best. Starting with the debate over boots and ending with him owning his own pub and still possessing the books.;Lost an earlier response but wanted to mention the possibility of both structures being present. Plenty of illicit but with Prendic, he passes authority (even if it&apos;s only due to ammo limit) so his outcome could be considered romantic not tragic.;My favorite scientific mistake in &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; was the implication that evolution would not leave anything that was unnecessary. From Coursera&apos;s &quot;Intro Psych&quot; comes a funny example, nipples on men. They have no practical purpose on men though I am happy to have mine. ;Outside of proper attribution, it was my understanding that citations were also used to explain the underlying links. For example, I wrote about Poe being a Proto-author. I provided a link that documented this attribution. He was the first American author to make his living by writing. When giving 320 words it seems unnecessary to me to further state this. I have other things I want to say up against that word limit. Am I misunderstanding something? I have been getting bombed in the peer review process (still working on this...grin) in part due to my lack of restating to me what I have documented. Not bitching...just curious as to where the misunderstanding is.;Thanks. So your suggesting to add some reference descriptions in the citation area? ;I wonder if Charly Chaplin little tramp was influenced by Well&apos;s Marvel character in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. He is the straw that stirs the drink and comes out the mess on top. A &quot;Gentleman on the tramp&quot; who outwits everyone.;Charlie Chaplin. He had the idea of the costume of the little tramp but no attribution. Prior exposure possibly but nothing directly. ;</string>
            <string>I was just reading &quot;Work expectations&quot; when came to the forum and seen  &quot;Threes&quot; topic. I do not want to teach you, pay attention or so. But I  think we are here to learn together, share information which might be  interesting. There was a remark about triples in the paragraph with  subtitle &quot;The Essays&quot; here -&gt; http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.html#gradingActually,  I think three is a really interesting number, magic and religious. As  well I would say that we like 3, because in many cases 2 is not enough  and 4 is too much.P.S. Excuse me for mistakes, English is not my mother language. ;</string>
            <string>I was thinking about the woods, which I had assumed were a dark and dangerous place. Looking at more of the stories, they seem more to be a place of magic, transformation, risk and adventure - an unknown place where the normal rules of home don&apos;t apply.Little Red Cap/Riding Hood is warned about the woods and threatened by a wolf, The Wonderful Musician attracts the attention of trickster animals there, while Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, the blinded prince in Rapunzel and the man seeking the girl transformed in the Raven are all lost in the woods. The Twelve Brothers, The Raven, Snow White and The Six Swans all hide in the woods.The woodsman - and huntsman in some stories - by his familiarity with the environment is not subject to the power of the woods and is capable of restoring order: rescuing Red Riding Hood and her grandmother  from the wolf which ate them, or freeing Snow White.;Useful comment Theodossai. I have heard a  similar  view  about horror films which allow the viewer to experience not only the terror of the victim, but also the threat of the &quot;monster&quot; (in whatever form) which helps us understand those thoughts and feelings without fearing them.;</string>
            <string>Nothing.;Is it significant that it says &quot;the one you are leaving...&quot;, not &quot;the pen you are leaving...&quot;?;</string>
            <string>P. Klein, I agree with your thoughts. I am also reminded of the verse in the New Testament that Jesus spoke, &quot;for whoever loses his life for me will save it.&quot; Faithful John lost his life for his King, but later on regained his life. The children thing could possibly be along the same vein, but I&apos;m not quite sure I understand why the children had to die first. Although the reference to Abraham and Isaac makes sense. ;</string>
            <string>I was very surprised that the queen was fine with the beheading of her children since she had little experience with John. But I wonder if we are superimposing our beliefs on this tale? Why wouldn&apos;t the queen be okay in a world where ravens talk and people come back to life and so on? ;</string>

            <string>I was toying with this idea myself. The similarities in the monster&apos;s story are too similar to me to Frankenstein&apos;s story to be coincidence. And the parallel between Walton and Frankenstein seemed very blatant to me as well. But my main issue is that the tone of each story is the same. Unlike Dracula where we had very different tones and language for each character when they stood as narrator, I found Frankenstein to be monotone. Did anyone else feel this way? ;</string>
            <string>As I continue with this course, I find myself looking forward to reading and providing feedback to my colleagues. And I also enjoy reading the comments about my essays. For the most part, the peer assessments (both giving and receiving) have been astute and helpful. But I am missing the opportunity to continue the discussion with my reviewers and with the authors I am reviewing.  Is anyone else feeling this way? ;My comment was not a bitch about peer eviews. I haven&apos;t had any reviews that were inappropriate. In fact, they have helped me to crystallize my thoughts for future essays. But they have also brought up great points for and against my thesis that I would love to explore/discuss with them. I understand the forums allow for discussion. But it is difficult to discuss to continue a discussion when you don&apos;t know who you are talking to.  ;This story resonates with me as well. I&apos;m a scientist and I relate to science and engineering being arts that most don&apos;t understand. It is a nice comparison to the other stories that have pitted science against nature. ;Owen doesn&apos;t get angry when the butterfly is destroyed. It is his zen like reaction of acceptance that is the unexpected and most moving part of the story for me. I was angry with Owen for not being angry. But it does take strength to be that accepting. Thus the story is also asking us to compare different types of strength and of beauty. The child seems to have inherited both strength and beauty. What do you think about the story carved on the box? Is it owen&apos;s interpretation of his own life or his wish for the child&apos;s life? Both? ;I am fascinated by the treatment of science in these stories as compared to the treatment of art. I found a nice series of articles looking at how Hawthorne contributed to science published in The New Atlantis. Here&apos;s the link if you are interested. ;Sorry about that.  Here it is. ;Yes. I don&apos;t know why my posts don&apos;t save the link. Thanks for looking it up for me. ;</string>
            <string>I enjoyed &quot;The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief&quot; as the opening phrase of the only paragraph in that chapter.  I also am enjoying the different writing style from The Island of Doctor Moreau. What do you think the point of the humor is? (I&apos;m still getting started with this reading. But this a topic I am pondering.) ;Interesting that I was looking at Kemp and Griffen as opposite faces of the &quot;scientist.&quot; Dr. kemp being tempered with compassion and Mr. Griffen devoid of compassion. I do like the idea that they are mirrors of Wells himself. That rings true for me as well. I am glad you brought it up. ;</string>
            <string>Good fary-tales include... heroy (usually young person, who yesterday was a child), antagonist (evil in all possible kinds), the &quot;prize&quot; (princess, saved life, peace in the world) and... magic :)... (someone who become heroy&apos;s friend or something helpful, for example magic wand). It works for Grimm&apos;s stories too.;Yeah, that&apos;s James Bond is so popular, like others modern stories. They use the same concepts.;The Stories seem to be very cruel in my understanding. Reading to children these fary-tales may be even danger for them, isn&apos;t it? ... :) Grimms use strange ways of the education, in my opinion. When I imagine these tales are true (children might) I feel scared. I haven&apos;t read all of the stories yet, but I will always remember tale about disgusting frog and little princess. I imagine I am the princess... And the frog eat from my plate...;Wow, it&apos;s wonderful conclusion. Fairy-tales show us inner feelings, not nessesarily they become actions in real lifeBad heroes sometimes attract children more then ideal characters because of their charm (don&apos;t know about heroes of Grimm brothers tales). And children hardly will copy their behavior.;</string>
            <string>Putting it in to context is crucial I believe.   Think about what was going on in 18th century Germany.   There was hardly anytime that they were not pulled into war with the rest of central Europe.   They lived in poverty (often under tyrannical monarchies).   Plus the constant religious upheaval....Catholicism or Lutherism?   It wasn&apos;t until the very end of this century that the Enlightenment movement came and lead to the Enlightenment Absolutism form of ruling in Germany.   And this finally lead to freedom of religion in the early 1900&apos;s.   How do you keep people in check?   You tell stories of those who, like you, live lives of hardship can find a &quot;happy ending&quot; by doing the right thing.   The right thing then maybe different then the right thing now.   Especially if you have never lived your entire life in a war torn country where the lives of the people was of little regard to those ruling.   The right thing may be to be like Cinderella, remain faithful and true no matter how bad things get and you will be rewarded.   While the punishment the sisters receive seem like a mid-evil form of justice the overall story is very Christian at it&apos;s core: the faithful will receive their everlasting happiness, the wicked will receive eternal damnation.      ;I hadn&apos;t gotten to Faithful John yet.   Definitely see the parallel there.;What I took away from that story was the inability to let go and how devastating it can be.   Starting with the hen.   Her inability to let go of her desire to have this nut even though they had made a pact lead to her death.   The cock does everything he can to save her, but the selfishness of others hinders him.   (This could strike a cord with those even today who go through trying to save the lives of loved ones while dealing with the red tape of insurance companies and FDA policies.)   People at this time often loss their children before the age of 10 and many children were left without at least one parent by their teens.   The cock consumed with the fact that there was nothing he could do slowly starts to consume everyone around them......could be likened to a family loosing someone very important and the family no longer being able to function.   I could be totally off....but, that what I took from the story =);</string>
            <string>Could it be, that cutting off the heads of the children is considered in some sense equal to the faithful John sacrifice? ;</string>
            <string>I think there is a lot of moral in Grimms&apos; stories, a lot of goo thought to transmit to a child (be honest, be humble, don&apos;t be selfish, don&apos;t be greedy, don&apos;t tell lies, don&apos;t be lazy...)The only thing I can&apos;t stand is the &quot;annihilation&quot; of some personal features that, in my opinion, make a child grow up well: curiosity, demanding respect from others, be proud of himself, etc.I understand the importance of &quot;contextualize&quot; books on autors&apos; background and historical period they wrote them, so maybe in Grimm&apos;s century it was normal to teach children to be docile and submissive.But I found a sort of &quot;dumbness&quot; in many characters of Grimms&apos; stories...  It seems they almost like to be in the poor and sad conditions in which they are, and only by case they manage to change. They don&apos;t even try, just go on being humble and &quot;get screwed&quot; untill some bigger power  (God, Devil, strange creatures...) give them something in way of retribution for their suffering.That, in my opinion, is the only un-enlightening thing about Grimms&apos; stories.;HelloJust a little question: what about writing something &quot;private&quot; into assignments?  E.g., I personally fear Grimms&apos; stories (as a child I was terrified by them!), may I &quot;put myself&quot; into my assignment to develop the issue of fear, cruelty, violence, injustice, in Grimms&apos; fairy tales?  Or will that invalidate my assignment?What do you think about?Thank you :);Thank you for answers :)I took the Grimms&apos; &quot;scary&quot; stories just as an example, but the question is about all the course&apos;s readings and beyond.  Of course the &quot;personal thoughts&quot; can be discussed in the forum, where they could be better expanded.By the way, I&apos;m just having some problems with reducing the text to maximum 320 words, so I think I won&apos;t put too much &quot;myself&quot; in it! But the question is still interesting :) thank you for answers;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m sorry for that, it&apos;s very frustrating and unfair :(In front of a text &quot;too well written&quot; you can have some doubt, that&apos;s natural, but accusing someone of plagiarism is an heavy offence.If I had any doubt about plagiarism, I would search on Google the most meaningful sentences of the text, to find out if it&apos;s really a mere copy of something. But if Google finds no identical results, I can have no evidence and so I have to evaluate my peer&apos;s work as an authentic essay. That&apos;s my opinion and the way I would behave in such an occasion.I hope you will always find clever peers for your next assignment.;Sure better than the first one :P  I hope it will be appreciated a bit moreI had some problems about the topics to deal with, too many ideas and too few words to write them! I tried to concentrate on a pair of subjects that I find interesting.I&apos;m curious to know what my peers think about my job.;</string>
            <string>I totally agree with you, and i think this concepts are well explained by Prof. Rabkin in the very first videos he released.He doesn&apos;t want to teach us notions about the books we are reading, he wants us to learn how to read deeply and generate our own ideas about them. That&apos;s what I understood by the introductory videos, so I&apos;m perfectly satisfied with the way he&apos;s leading the course.;I am a  non-native English speaker and I had some trouble, in particular with the old fisherman!Thank you for the comments on characters&apos; accents, I just notice them slightly while reading. I would like to learn more about that.;Same for me :)I have received a lot of suggestions like that: &quot;focus on ONE point, ONE thesis, ONE idea&quot;.  It is quite difficult for me to choiche ONE... while reading, I note down all that catches my attention and makes me think. So, I would like to deal with all those interesting (to me) subjects, share all of them with my fellows!  But peers who evaluated me told that I should have dealt with only one, and I have to admit that... they are right!With a so limited number of words, it&apos;s impossible to go deep in three or four subjects. An essay is not a &quot;grounding&quot; of a lot of ideas a book arouses, it&apos;s an in-depth analysis about something. So, having a heavy restriction like that, it&apos;s better to chose one topic and do the best to expand it.That is what I learnt by my Alice assignment :)  I&apos;m afraid next time I will spend more time choosing the target of my essay than writing it!! &gt;_&lt;;Hi,I noticed that many people complain that the third section of the evaluating form is often left empty.Some of my reviewers just wrote &quot;good job&quot;, most left blank, only few commented my theory and explained his/her ideas about.But I don&apos;t feel disapointed at all.I think that people who have nothing useful to say (i.e. any that will really improve my writing abilities or illustrate different point of view on what I said), have well done saying nothing.  I&apos;ve understood that the third section is optional, and it must be written only if you have any useful suggestion to give to the peer. I&apos;ve done that if I had some correction to do, something I would have made different, or to explain my point of view (that not always agrees with the essay).  But often the situation is: I&apos;ve already suggested something in the first and second section and I have no other interesting thing to say to help my peer -&gt; I leave the third section in blank, or complment with the writer and say thanks to give me food for thought.Am I wrong?  I&apos;m not a native English-speaker, so my English is not too good and I am aware that I make too mistakes to correct other people.I&apos;m no more a student since many years, so I&apos;m not used to write essays and I am aware that my critiques have no scholastic value.  I just enrolled this course to improve my English and enjoy readings, but I put myself out to do my best, both in writing and reviewing my peers.  Just I often feel unable to suggest anything to someone who wrote a very good essay. I&apos;ve nothing useful to &quot;teach&quot; or &quot;suggest&quot; (indeed, I learn a lot from other essays!)So, please, don&apos;t be angry with reviewers that left blank the third section :) maybe they are not lazy, just &quot;noob&quot; like me!  ;what you say on the 3rd section is also useful and pleasant to receive ;) what is worthless is sarcasm here;</string>
            <string>I agree that some characters are stunningly stupid.   But there&apos;s still a lesson.   &quot;Hans in Luck&quot; tells us to not give in to sudden impulses and to look at the big picture.   Applications include setting aside time to study before playing, what you do with your girlfriend and deciding what job to take.;</string>
            <string>I think fairy tales are not only a means of entertainment. Looking at them in the time they were written and the context is very important. In the 21st century we look at them as fun stories our parents told us or the basis of movie scripts for entertainment but at the time the were originally written may have been to communicate messages that one could not say explicitly. There was a time when freedom of speech was nonexistent and one could lose there life for saying certain things. Also fairy tales were used to explain many situations and scenarios that people could not understand.      ;</string>
            <string>I AGREE that   Hans is someone who lives mindfully in the present.   He doesn&apos;t need to hold on to possessions, perhaps this is a metaphor for his journey to a more evolved spiritual state.  ;</string>
            <string>Great thread, I loved the story of Hans in luck. As per the story, happiness or luck doesn&apos;t lie in possessions as these may often be perceived as a burden. Also, Hans thought that what others had was better than what he had, even though that was not the case. We perceive him as a fool because he gets easily convinced by others that what they have is better than what he has, but haven&apos;t we all been through that? We get convinced of needing things we don&apos;t have and that &quot;the grass is greener on the other side&quot; to realise later in life that the things we have could turn into a burden instead of a bliss. His perception of luck I think was also in his optimism and ability to remain happy even after losing his possessions.;</string>
            <string>Hey Dorothy,I believe it is more complicated than that and correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but the Course Syllabus further explains the following:  &quot;If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and  Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will  have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of  Accomplishment.   If, though, five average 2 and two average 1, you will  have an average of approximately 1.7 and will not have earned your  Statement of Accomplishment.   However, you have ten opportunities to  submit your work and only the seven highest submissions contribute to  your average.&quot;My understanding from the paragraph is that you need to have scored an average of 1.8 when considering both form and content in at least six essays and an average of 1 in one essay. One of the ways to do this is to have at least a total score of 3.6 in 6 essays and a score of two in one essay, so the average of both content and form for each essay is 1.8.That is how I understood it. So a score of 3.6 - 4 is more similar to a pass than a score of 3. A score of 3 in the 7 highest scored essays will only result in an average of 1.5 and it will not receive a State of Accomplishment.I am not too clear on this, so if anyone knows a bit more please correct me.Cheers.;That is an interesting point of view. It could be a reflection on the values of society and these have changed over the times. I am finding that there&apos;s also an important religious influence in the story that is characteristic of the period in which it was written.;Hey Chelsea,I am not too sure about this. But I thought Dracula could change into different forms: bat, fog, man as long as it was night. That is, from sunset to sunrise. So, when he bit Mina and changed into different forms at midnight it was because he was not limited to only one form. From sunset on he is able to change, as long as there is no daylight. On the other hand, Dracula is limited during the days and he can only stay in his human form and usually in his coffin. That is my understanding anyways.You are correct about the incident at Piccadilly. I assumed he was in his human form?;</string>
            <string>Sara, note how it says that it is the average on Form and Content for each essay. So If in a given essay a person gets 1 in form and 2 in content the total score is of 3. However, the average between Form and Content is of 1.5;Hey Gustavo, another Venezuelan here. Great way to put it in a story. Happy reading :);Hey Lauren,While I understand your concern and I&apos;ve mentioned using Freud&apos;s interpretations in other forums, some psychoanalitic theories have proved to be useful in understanding narrations. The professor cites the author Bruno Bettelheim, who explores these theories and their applications in different stories. When we deal with interpreting a work of art, such as literature, using a recognized framework of thought and interpretation gives more security to our own claims and interpretations. You mention how baffled you are by people using these frameworks, whereas I&apos;d rather to be more tolerant with others&apos; interpretations and their use of frameworks from different fields. I imagine that others may not be as cognizant in the works of Marx, Levi, Strauss and others. People in general -myself included-   could be more familiar with Freud&apos;s Framework and use it because the metaphors are a bit more obvious. Bear in mind that some of us are approaching interpretation of literature for the first time and we don&apos;t know if there is a right or wrong philosophical approach to read these stories.;Well, you are not alone in wishing to hear from other frameworks. I am a psychologist and even as such I&apos;ve tried to avoid Freudian interpretations in my essays. Nonetheless, it is sort of difficult to think of different themes to interpret the text. While reading Dracula, I struggled to   find original themes that did not have to do with sex or Freudian symbolism as I thought it would not be as enlightening as other sort of motifs.;That is what I understood as well Daniel. So the average of the total score on the 7 essays should actually be of 3.6 in order to pass or get the State of Accomplishment.;I understood that Joseph. What I meant was:  1 Essay would have:Total Score: 3.6, which equals: 1.8 in Form + 1.8 in Content. Averaging 1.8 in both Form and Content. Does that make sense?Note how it says &quot;averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay&quot;It is not clear if that is the way in which the Final Score will be averaged. Is it the average of Form + Content? or the Average calculated between Form and Content?;It would be great if a member of the Staff would clarify this for all of us please :);I am also enrolled in both courses. I find it a bit exhausting. Not the readings though, but I wish we didn&apos;t have to complete an assignment each week for Fantasy and Science Fiction. I will try to improve my average to see if I can at least miss three of the assignments. I know it&apos;s not ideal, but I find there&apos;s not enough time.I understand your point Javier, I guess that&apos;s what you get when enrolling in a course called Fiction of Relationship. Some of the next readings are not much about romance though, so try to hang in there.Cheers,M.;Dioni, I know what you mean. When you add peer reviews to the assignments it&apos;s a heavy load. I will try to finish though as I already left unfinished another coursera course. Hope we can all make it :);I don&apos;t know if it was just me, but I felt sort of sorry for Dracula...being killed so easily after living or trying to for such a long time. I expected more of a fight. Anyways, essay time...;I hear you Sean, it is so difficult to settle on topic each week. I thought the blood was a mistake in the edition...;</string>
            <string>Ooh, I did not know this. I hope it works for Australian time zone. Thanks :);Just have to say Anna, I love your interpretation of the Monster as a child. He is in fact too young to know the difference and the moral consequences of killing. I am not justifying the killings, but he could not be as accountable as an educated adult.;Hey Anonymous, I think the OP was referring to a Total Score of 2. Which is different from a Score of 2 in either Content or Form.;Hey Everyone,In another thread buried in the forum https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=408&amp;post_id=3386#post-3386 these thoughts and calculations are discussed.A Total score of 2 is a score of Fail. A Score of 1 in Content or Form is a score of Fail. If a person has a Total Score of 2 in their 7 highest scored assignments they will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment. It seems that most peer reviewers are confused about this issue. This is causing peer reviewers to feel they are being generous when assigning a score of One, when in fact they are failing students.On the other hand, students who have total scores of less than 4 feel like they are failing the course for reasons that are not carefully explained by reviewers and as a consequence they are dropping out of the course. I am having the same issue with my scores and was given a score of 1 for only one &quot;wrong&quot; aspect of my essay. I want to invite reviewers to have a better understanding of the scores they are assigning to other students. Most of us want to learn and improve, but the fear of failing the course is preventing some of us from enjoying the ride and improving our writing.;A flag can be done in the comments section and in it appears it can be done on essays as well. A flag is to disagree with someone or point out their behavior is rude or against the rules. The green points on the forums means voting up one opinion when they agree with a point that is made on the post. They don&apos;t have any other meaning. Not everyone votes on the posts people make that&apos;s why most post have 0 :);This is a great discussion John and I like your last phrase. In your original post you mention sympathy and justice and it&apos;s interesting how both concepts are interrelated. For me, I could feel sympathy for someone but that does not make me justify the person&apos;s actions. A person is to be deemed responsible for their behavior.Now, this was a child monster without any sort of education and upbringing. It makes me think of the cases when children have been lost and raised by animals, as he had a limited contact with the human race. What I&apos;m trying to say is that personal situations sometimes makes you look at moral codes of society from a different perspective. It does not necessarily mean that justice should not be applied in his case, but his individual circumstances are able to raise people&apos;s sympathy and understanding. ;Thanks for that Andreja. I have the exact same issue and was failed in Form because of it. The problem sometimes is that when you add spaces it gets too spaced and when you take then out it looks convoluted. I&apos;ve tried both ways and it was difficult to find a balance. I guess I&apos;ll have to preview at least three times with upcoming essays.;I agree Constance, the monster&apos;s argument was compelling. It is a sad story and one keeps wondering if things could have been different if the &quot;monster&quot; was only allowed the possibility of feeling like a human being. I felt much more empathy for the &quot;monster&quot; than for Frankenstein.;I agree with you Paul, it might have been best to leave it at pass or fail. Yet I disagree in that students err on being generous. It has not been the case with my reviewers at least. Even though I realize my essays have flaws and are the result of a quick analysis, as it is my first time reading these books.  I constantly get Fail in either Form or Content from at least more than one peer. That is, I get a score of one for mere details. These details are things like the spacing of paragraphs given by the software of coursera, - which is out of my control - or when the peer thinks the thesis is too general or not that original or enlightening. It is near impossible coming up with an interpretation that hasn&apos;t been thought out before, specially if I&apos;m no expert on literary analysis. I&apos;ve seriously given better grades than the ones I&apos;ve received for essays that have more mistakes and aspects that need improvement. Sometimes people tend to mark down instead of marking up, specially if they&apos;re given the same treatment by other peers. They try to find mistakes to justify the score they assign. A score of One seems generous to some people, not realizing that a score of One is equivalent to a Fail. All in all, I am preparing for the possibility of failing this course even if I turn in all my essays and make a great effort on them. At least I know I will learn &quot;something&quot; from people&apos;s feedback. Even if it&apos;s just a general view of human nature and students&apos; behaviors when grading people they have never met and may never meet. Could this lead to generosity and a genuine interest in helping others? Or could it lead to competitiveness and downgrading others? We&apos;ll see.;I agree with you Ratka. I am also doing the Brown University course of The Fiction of Relationship. It is my first time doing these courses and even though we have peer reviews in the Fiction of Relationship course, students don&apos;t get penalized by this system. Instead, you only need to turn in a &quot;valid&quot; essay in order to receive a Statement of Accomplishment.Now, I know that Statements of Accomplishment may not mean much. But psychologically they do. I don&apos;t need a certificate, but I want to feel my effort is being appreciated. It is important to note that people also fear failure. They don&apos;t want to feel like they failed an online course, so I understand if they prefer dropping out.In addition, some people perceive virtual &quot;peer review&quot; as unfair. It is also different when peer review is used in a classroom, when you know the students. There is a face to face component that makes fellow student more able to empathize with their classmates. But in a virtual environment the ability to empathize is diminished and people is not afraid to show their &quot;dark side.&quot; Specially when the system is not properly regulated and is Anonymous.;Hey Lauren,I agree with your comments in that it is best to focus on the whole of the essay and the points you are trying to make. However, as a non-native speaker I can relate to reviewers who make these mistakes. I am sure I make these as well. Yet, it seems a bit unkind to review the review.  Most of us are already making an effort - not always rewarded- by crafting the essays. The reviews are an additional effort and they are not always planned and carefully constructed. Nonetheless, I would not blame someone - native or non-native speaker- for not articulating exactly what they mean in their reviews.;Just wanted to point out that I agree with all your suggestions. I was merely referring to the grammar when giving feedback. Not all of us are experienced professionals in giving feedback and may find particularly difficult to point out the aspects that need improvement using proper language, grammar and punctuation. The options of providing a space for feedback and learning resources to improve the way we give feedback could prove useful in making the coursera experience more valuable for students who are struggling to keep up the pace with more experienced professionals. Specially considering non-native speakers that are not accustomed to having to identify mistakes in structure, grammar and language. ;There seems to be a misunderstanding in the Forums regarding the scores for Form, Content and the difference with the Total Score produced by the system. The difference relies in the mechanics used to calculate the average required to receive a State of Accomplishment. For instance, some students think they are doing well when receiving a Score of 3, when they are actually failing.On the other hand, some peer reviewers assign scores of 1 for pure details and they don&apos;t realize that they are actually assigning a Score of Fail   without providing sufficient reason for it. The structure of the course and the pacing seems challenging for most people, but some are willing to make the effort. However, this effort is not translated in results when adding the complicated scoring system and how different people interpret it. It would be helpful if the staff could clarify the following statement: &quot;If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and  Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will  have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of  Accomplishment.&quot;The calculations are also discussed in this thread: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=408 The statement implies that the Total Score should be of 4 - or an approximate of 3.6 - Thus, for Form or Content, 1= Failed, 2 = Passed and 3 = Above Expectations. I invite reviewers to take note of these differences and strive for fairness when scoring essays.;Hey Paul,I Understand this distinction. I have read opinions in forums where there seems to be a misunderstanding about these. I was only trying to look for a clarification from the Staff, who has failed to provide this clarification for everyone to understand. As you pointed out previously, the scores have another particularity as the are calculated from the Median and not   the average of Peer Scores. There is also a reason why the percentages in which each score should be  assigned are discussed in the course syllabus and that&apos;s also  considered in the assertions I make. My main post has been voted down and I suspect this thread will soon disappear like the others, so I guess it is not valid to ask questions about these issues. I was only hoping that the coursera community would provide help instead of voting down a request for clarification. A clarification from the Staff would have been perceived as more accurate and valid from all peers, so that&apos;s what I was looking for, in spite of my opinion and invitation to consider the reasons behind a score of 1. Oh well, all for naught. People who vote down and don&apos;t comment are like reviewers who fail essays and don&apos;t provide feedback. If they disagree with what I&apos;m saying they could argument the points I&apos;m making, even if they remain in anonymity. But after all, Haters are going to hate and Trolls are going to troll.;The overall grade average if you are talking about Total Score for each essay should be of 3.6.;I noticed it right away, so cute :);</string>
            <string>That&apos;s right Martha, thanks for this. I received 1.5 one time, so I think I only had 4 reviewers that time as there is no way to get decimals with 5 reviewers according to this. I hope next times I have at least 5 reviewers.;I agree with you Emma. We may be too sensitive and unprepared to argue with reviewers. I&apos;ve found in these discussions that sometimes people get your points and understand your argument but sometimes they feel offended and think you are out there to attack people - not ideas. A story has many readings and language has many layers. To add to this, we all come from totally different backgrounds and life situations. What some people consider being rude, others take it as a normal way of expressing concern. I am not ashamed to say that my posts have been voted down in countless occasions even when I have not been offensive, yet my words and arguments tend to be too assertive.Discussing as an intellectual exercise is best when your passions, emotions and self-esteem are not at stake. Which is not the case with peer reviewers. As reviewers assign a score to your essay, they are in a position of power, just like teachers or bosses when they review your performance. Imagine how a discussion with your teacher or boss would turn out. At least you are faced with them day-to-day and you know them, but with virtual environments no one knows who other students are and their circumstances.;I think that it at least makes us wonder about the definition of Monster and the definition of Evil. In my opinion he was not 100% evil, but he was not totally good either.  Evil is at times defined by the person&apos;s actions, even if they start out with having good intentions. Victor was too ambitious and selfish and that&apos;s how his actions balanced more towards evilness than towards goodness. If you look at characters that have been defined as evil throughout all the stories you will find they are not always evil at the beginning, but their selfishness and ambition makes them go in that direction. At least at the end Victor was able to repent. But he was not able to love beyond his immediate circle and his motivations were still selfish. Even after admitting his guilt, he engaged in revenge with the monster instead of trying to forgive him. It never occurred to him to try to have more sympathy for the creature. He was a conflicted hero and it is a bit difficult to defend his actions, even though we may feel sorry for him.;Hola a todos,Ac   les dej _ un link para que se animen, pues es m  s dif _cil aprender espa  ol que ingl  s.Here&apos;s a link to cheer you up, as it is more difficult to learn spanish than english.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjDe4sLER0 Saludos.;A 2 is a pass only if you&apos;ve received 2&apos;s in both Form and Content, which would be a Total Score of 4 for each essay. Note how it says that you have to calculate the average between Form and Content for each essay, not the sum of both components.;This has been discussed in several other threads and the conclusion is that a Total Score of 2 is a fail. OP, a score of 3.5 would still be a fail, it should be at least 3.6 or 4. Note how it says that you have to calculate the average between Form and Content for each essay, not the sum of both. Therefore, for each essay: Total Score = (Form+Content)Total score of 2 (1+1)= The average is of 1, so FailTotal score of 1 (1+0)= It is not possible since the lowest score for each component is 1Total score of 3 (1+2)= The average is of 1.5, thus it&apos;s still a FailTotal score of 3.5 (1.5+2)= The average is of 1.75, thus it&apos;s still a FailTotal score of 4 (2+2)= The average is of 2, so it&apos;s a PassHope it helps.;</string>
            <string>As I read this, it struck me that he really does think only of what is happening in that moment. But it also struck me that he was exceedingly naive to not see the trend of his trades. I saw it as gullibility rather than mindfulness; he can be talked into thinking anything is better than what he has.;</string>
            <string>I am reminded of these lines from the Bhagavad Gita:Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma phaleshou kada chana - You have the right to perform your actions, but you are not entitled to the fruits of the actions.Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhurmatey Sangostva Akarmani     Do not let the fruit be the purpose of your actions, and therefore you won   t be attached to not doing your dutySo could Hans have been selfless and not cared for the fruit of his labour? If he did, he wouldn&apos;t part with gold.Other explainations is that he really is dumb/ not materialistic.I find Tina&apos;s theory on the rhetoric of advertising really interesting. Nice insight.;</string>
            <string>Hans may well get a hiding when he gets home to his mother.By trading a staggering quantity of gold for a horse, Hans is established as fool engaged in short-term thinking, whose gullibility is played on by those around him - finally by someone who convinces him a couple of stones is better than a goose! The story is fun to read because we know he&apos;s a fool, and he doesn&apos;t.Hans is a lot like me the time I went to Indonesia without checking the value of the currency, i.e. poorer at the end of the day than the beginning.;Hi, I got Left Hand of Darkness for $NZ3 at a cheap second-hand shop (which I appreciate is non-zero), and it&apos;s also at one of our local public libraries. Martian Chronicles, I had no such luck. If you love books you might find a second-hand shop that you can volunteer at in return for reading them. If you are incredibly fortunate you&apos;re near a shop that lets you sit and read anyway.If those are all out of the question, I&apos;m out of ideas for actually reading those books legally. I don&apos;t think it will turn out to be true that you can&apos;t participate for those two weeks. On the reading so far, I can see how people spend years on just Dracula or Grimm, for example. If you like the forums, I imagine there will be people still wanting to engage in discussions on your favourite books, in your unstructured weeks. And, you might by that stage find it great having three weeks to prepare a superawesome final essay on Doctorow.I imagine there will also emerge from the discussion boards and lectures, LOTS of other suggestions of things to read, which you might find free. You could post an essay on a different, related book on the discussion board, and someone is highly likely to give you feedback. You don&apos;t need permission. I see there&apos;s a &quot;More to Learn&quot; tab over on the left, too.If you&apos;re anything like me, one of the hard things in having a &quot;time-rich&quot; life, is structuring that time. It&apos;s an incredibly valuable skill to develop. Good luck.;This story has fresh poignancy for me as adult knowing of cases where children have been raised in captivity (including the recent Cleveland case). Somehow the ending, with the wandering in the desert, and the thorns and the blindness and the falling on his neck weeping, tears healing his eyes - this picture of grief and healing fits well.Locked in a room for twelve years, terrified at the sight of   a man. Happens. I never thought of this as a kid, with the climbing up and down the hair routine going on.;When it comes to representation of women in Grimm, The Fisherman and His Wife stands out for me.The bleeding Flounder /   enchanted Prince, fished up by a fisherman who fishes and fishes and fishes, must surely represent Christ. This Christ-figure has no problem granting a woman&apos;s ambition to be King, Emperor and Pope, her obedient husband&apos;s anxieties notwithstanding. The fish finally rewards her ambition to be like God, by granting her a lowly Christ-like station back in the pigsty - &quot;And the first shall be last and the last shall be first&quot;.;Hi all, I&apos;m interested in what people think of Stoker&apos;s handling of The New Woman, and Mina&apos;s role, with her perfect blend of &apos;masculine brain&apos; and &apos;feminine heart&apos;. In other words, she&apos;s intelligent, compassionate and saves the day. A well-written hero *thumbs up*.;The answer is yes. You can pass the course with a minimum of six essays, if they are good enough.;Sublimation - it&apos;s a good thing. And Carroll put the sublime in sublimation.;I think the resistance to looking this with regard to Carroll - or should I say, Dodgson - is the huge importance of the story of that boat ride in which Wonderland was conceived (so to speak). In a way, that &quot;golden afternoon, full leisurely we glide&quot;, *is* the story of Alice in Wonderland.Was Dodgson &apos;into&apos; little girls? In a way, he invented little girls, and I suspect the lectures in this unit will look at how childhood itself is invented.And I&apos;m not surprised few people want to mess with that.I think my new favourite concept, &apos;atavism&apos; is at play here. We&apos;re surrounded now by talk of paedophilia, and media sexualisation of childhood, yet we are loathe to draw a line from those, back through Shirley Temple, to Dodgson, the &quot;lover of children&quot; at the dawn of photography.By the way, interesting euphemism, that - paedophile. Like it&apos;s some kind of sexual orientation. I prefer &apos;child molester&apos; and &apos;child rapist&apos; in cases where those apply.Dodgson was certainly an aesthetic lover of children (except boys). It&apos;s difficult to clear-headedly examine the connections (or not) between aestheticism, eroticism, sexualisation, objectification, and abuse. We know aestheticism can go horribly wrong - that doesn&apos;t mean it went terribly wrong in this case. It does sound like the parents of the children were right to be wary.;I guess I&apos;ve added one problematic term to another by bringing in &apos;sexual orientation&apos;!But on &apos;paedophilia&apos;, I don&apos;t know how it is where you are, but here in New Zealand we commonly hear the phrase &apos;convicted paedophile&apos; in the news. The important distinction you have made has been lost, if it was ever there, in the &apos;public imagination&apos; (if there is such a thing).   To that picture add frequent news of internet child pornograohy.All of these probably are more hindrances than help in understanding Dodgson/Carroll. &quot;Paedophile&quot; has become one of those conversational bombs like &quot;terrorist&quot; (I&apos;d be interested to know which is used more frequently).Perhaps better talk of experiencing attraction to children. And, for better or for worse, if Dodgson had not been attracted to girls to a degree most would be uncomfortable with, he would not have created this character that has attracted millions of readers and collectors over nearly 150 years now.;</string>
            <string>Thank you for expanding a little on how Mina differs from a New Woman. I&apos;d agree she doesn&apos;t fit a feminist mould, or any other kind of mould.I think the novel offers a different theory of how society changes. Mina expects society to change, but perhaps like Dracula she has a longer-term perspective. There&apos;s perhaps a hint that in a different time and place she might choose to marry someone other than Jonathan - but I think she truly does love Jonathan and wants to marry him (which some may find too convenient).While totally accepting the current state of society, she acts decisively to further the world&apos;s positive evolution. Yes, when necessary, but &apos;when necessary&apos; is quite a good time to do things. She is the boss in those last few chapters, and is able to insist with quite some authority that Dracula be vanquished with love. Then she becomes a model for her son of what a woman can be, and so influences future society. I&apos;m impressed by the way Mina differentiates herself from Jonathan - allowing a door to shut between them, ending the fused relationship the rather sappy Jonathan would have wanted. From a family sytems perspective, acts of differentiation like this can have a broader positive impact than ideological stances for or against marriage, childbirth and work.Yes, it&apos;s a little disappointing that Van Helsing seems to put Mina&apos;s heroics squarely in the past (actually he puts it more that she inspired heroics in others). It would be nice to see a sequel of Mina&apos;s further adventures, to see how Stoker imagined this family&apos;s life progressing. By the way, Stephanie, did you mean that your thesis was that the *character* of Dracula represented the New Woman in this novel? Now that would be interesting.;I appreciated the pattern interrupt. We both want to encourage a more nuanced understanding of this complex set of phenomena. There&apos;s a lot of interesting material on Wikipedia, and evidently a lot of work is being done on all aspects of this web of problems - including work on clarifying how the word &apos;paedophile&apos; is used in law enforcement, which, I suppose, is the main influence on how the word is used in the media.I agree with Karen that we&apos;ve done well to keep calm on this, it really is a minefield.Change of topic, but bear with me:The science section of the current Coursera course on Climate Change starts with an exercise: take one or more empty sheets of paper, set a timer for 15 minutes, draw a representation of everything you know about the Earth&apos;s climate system, and annotate it. Keep going for the whole 15 minutes, even if it seems to be a really long time. This will be a picture of your current mental model of the Earth&apos;s climate system.I thought, whoa! *now* I get what a mental model is, I&apos;d heard about them for many years but had no clear idea of what they really were.And then they start the teaching.I say all this because a willingness to unpack mental models is really necessary if people are to engage in meaningful conversation on hot topics. I hope everyone gets to learn how to do that (perhaps starting with something easier than pedophilia!);Also not going to top Sean&apos;s answer, but back the truck up - it&apos;s interesting where our minds go with nonsense words.&quot;vorpal sword&quot;, uncapitalised.Could be:the sword was vorpal, vorpal being any kind of adjectiveor possiblythe sword was made of vorpal.If you capitalise it (as Carroll didn&apos;t), you&apos;re far more likely to give the impression that there is this iconic sword or kind of sword, The Vorpal.It really seems to have gone that direction in the role-playing-game world.wikipedia cites Martin Gardner saying Carroll once wrote: &apos;I am afraid I can&apos;t explain &apos;vorpal blade&apos; for you   nor yet &apos;tulgey wood.&apos;Now why don&apos;t we go the same direction with &apos;tulgey&apos;? It&apos;s just a nonsense adjective (I get a kind of gloomy, eerie feel).And then I see online that people have turned it into The Tulgey Wood, a place in Wonderland! I would never have gone there (so to speak).I think someone could write a thesis on how late 20th-century/21st century culture takes literature and churns it in these ways.Anyway, more language play from Carroll.Speaking of where we go with nonsense words, I&apos;d better link to the Bouba/Kiki effect:http://boingboing.net/2011/05/26/the-boubakiki-effect.html;Adding to all this - communication and communication technology seems to be a theme of the book. It all wouldn&apos;t work if Castle Dracula had had good mobile coverage. All the telegrams and things going around seem more than just great extensions to the epistolary format. There&apos;s Mina and Jonathan&apos;s shorthand thing, and Dracula intercepting it. Notice how time and space kind of warp to leave Lucy vulnerable, that slip in the address of the telegram which leaves a hole in modernity through which Dracula pounces.And then there&apos;s the &apos;communication&apos; between Mina and Dracula.;  I&apos;ve picked this up as a theme in Dracula:   the way it&apos;s really hard to hold on to the reality of experiences   that aren&apos;t part of our &apos;normal&apos; worldview.The day after Seward sees irrefutable proof of vampiric activity, he manages to completely talk himself out of believing it. This is related to Van Helsing talking about how the modern rationalist won&apos;t believe in his own experience (and his whole occult scientist routine, which probably deserves another thread). Then at the very end, the group return to Transylvania and it&apos;s like nothing happened. And they had so meticulously assembled this epic-length tome of evidence only to find...oops, it turns out to be no evidence at all.Another thing which might be Stoker&apos;s writing or it might be me:  the first few chapters of Dracula have quite a singular mood, and I could really get into the whole Castle Dracula feel, and then whoa, when Jonathan realises he&apos;s being hypnotised - anyway, whoa.And then, while reading the back-in-London sections - it was very hard to *remember* in a way the feel of those seemingly unforgettable early chapters. Does anyone know what I mean?;Did Stoker coin this phrase? Brilliant line:&quot;&quot;If ever a face meant death - if looks could kill - we saw it at that moment.&quot;Interestingly, searching for the phrase online yields pages about the evil eye,   I hadn&apos;t thought of the connection before.So at that moment the good guys see the reality behind the ancient notion that a look can kill - and at the same time, they don&apos;t die, looks can&apos;t kill. The superstition is real and not true at the same time.;Jonathan admits in the opening paragraph that he is scared to go too far from the station - I think he&apos;s also &quot;scared to go too far from the station&quot; intellectually or to make really original observation.Which reminds me of one of my favourite movies, &apos;The Squid and the Whale&apos;, which is also about the fear of opening up to experience beyond received notions.;</string>
            <string>Tom. Hmm. (I&apos;m told it&apos;s good etiquette to write &apos;Hmm.&apos;)To sum up:You&apos;re recruiting people to write propaganda.It doesn&apos;t sound so pretty, written short and accurate like that, does it?;Great, so long as we&apos;re clear. I regret my confrontational tone.;On a different note, John Michael Greer at thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com is a great writer who is a couple of months into a series on our tendency to dichotomously think of the future in either apocalyptic or triumphalist terms.We&apos;re in a world increasingly divided into those who expect, yes, oblivion or apocalypse, the latest version of which is Near Term Extinction - or those who expect business to go on as usual, bigger and brighter.It would be nice to think that wishing would make the latter so, but it&apos;s more plausible (to me) that we will see some degree of collapse, technically defined as rapid loss of complexity.Greer has edited &quot;After Oil: SF Visions of of a Post-Petroleum World&quot; , a collection of reader stories depicting human life in a...more plausible future.I haven&apos;t read it, but this idea is closer to what I expect from science fiction, exploring what *might* happen, rather than being propaganda for some vision of what *should* happen.I look forward to learning more about the connection between science fiction and futurism, later in the course.PS For those with the stomache for it, I highly recommend Dmiry Orlov&apos;s (non-fiction) The Five Stages of Collapse, to help start thinking more clearly about what might happen beyond simple &apos;oblivion&apos; or &apos;technological triumph&apos;. ;Stay tuned for the unit on Ursula LeGuin - she&apos;s one of Miyazaki&apos;s very favourite authors, and he apparently keeps the Earthsea books by his bedside. I found similarities between A Wizard of Earthsea and Ponyo. I wonder what we&apos;ll find in The Left Hand of Darkness.;Did you notice that Van Helsing&apos;s English became perfect when talking to Renfield?His facility with the language ebbs and flows all over the place.Why?I think it allows him to expand his range of expression.At one end, there are the two paragraphs starting &quot;Friend John&quot; in chapter 13. I got the impression when first reading - this is like the more esoteric parts of The Gospel of St John! Which would be consistent with Van Helsing&apos;s role as esoteric/occult scientist.And then at the other end, there&apos;s the great moment when Seward is saying if only he&apos;d paid a bit more attention, maybe Lucy would not have become one of the undead, and they wouldn&apos;t have had to drive a stake through her heart and chop off her head. And Van Helsing comes out with a garbled version of &quot;Ah, well, it&apos;s no use crying over spilt milk&quot;. I mean, WHAT??? Brilliant moment. I don&apos;t think a fluent English speaker could get away with that line. (and what&apos;s happening in the silence after he says it?)One aspect of modernity is the standardisation of language (and in ways our range of expression has narrowed considerably since Stoker was writing). Perhaps Stoker is commenting on what is being lost in that process.;One reason Victor is very hard to identify with is that he is riddled with toxic shame (and almost by definition, nobody wants to identify with shame).My evidence for this is the wonderful description of toxic shame in Chapter 9:&quot;I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view&quot;.When shame and terror run so deep as to disturb your sensory processing, as they do with Victor - well a lot of things are hard. You&apos;d think he would have been able to, for example, save Justine by reporting that he saw a suspicious character near where William was killed - but he seems almost physically unable to, the way his senses and thought processes are hijacked by shame.That he comes across as an &apos;impostor&apos; would also be consistent with this.I&apos;m only on chapter 10, so I&apos;ll see how this thesis holds up in later chapters.Here&apos;s a link to Joseph Burgo who writes on shame, often using characters from literature as examples.http://www.afterpsychotherapy.com/the-invisible-client/;Phew, I can recommend identifying more with Victor if you can manage it. It makes for a terrifying novel.Okay, I&apos;m going out on a limb.Spoilers below.It&apos;s part of Shelley&apos;s genius that we find it easier to sympathise with the creature. That&apos;s the way I read it when I was younger.Doing so requires us to ignore, firstly, that the creature too is a stupid, egotistic, self-pitying drama-queen, to a homicidal extent.It also requires overlooking the body count. Apologies in advance, I can&apos;t resist a parody here:&quot;Sure he shows himself willing to murder in both hot and cold blood, sure he calculatingly frames a girl for murder because she&apos;s unlikely to sleep with him, and sure he bullies and threatens Victor, but underneath he&apos;s this sensitive guy, you know? Oh yeah, he psychologically terrorizes Victor, and goes out of his way to strangle Victor&apos;s best friend and wife - but oh, he&apos;s going through such angst as he does it!!! Poor soul - not like that whiny Victor, I don&apos;t know what his problem is...&quot;I say stupid, not un-intelligent. Both Victor and the creature are highly intelligent. Victor is stupid only around 80%-90% of the time. Because he finally wrests himself from his stupidity, Victor is the hero, and the creature is not.In the world of the novel, it is Victor who gives us the main account of the creature, and he&apos;s eager to bring this sympathizable character (and his touching back-story) fully to life. Victor is also finally unashamed to document his own stupidity. Thus the way he comes across in the book is at odds with the impression he makes on Walton and the crew. If he hadn&apos;t been stupid then he wouldn&apos;t be able to offer this cautionary tale.And this is how people are, intelligent yet often stupid and short-sighted. That&apos;s why Frankenstein is an important novel.What&apos;s at the root of Victor&apos;s and the creature&apos;s stupidity? I can&apos;t just now find the key sentence, where Victor says something like, The whole time I was the monster&apos;s slave, I was impulsive and did the first thing that came into my head.The word &quot;slave&quot; here points to the key theme of Necessity and Freedom (roughly, free will vs. determinism) - that probably deserves another thread. Here I&apos;ll just say I think Necessity is the real monster.Victor is stupid when he is in the grip of Necessity - and he wrests himself free. The creature doesn&apos;t know he is in Necessity&apos;s grip, so he doesn&apos;t even try. He has no clue how diabolical is his &quot;reasoning&quot;. Tragic.;Agreed!! That the shortsighted, single-minded pursuit of scientific discovery is kind of the point of Victor Frankenstein.;I agree, Anna, that this work does seem to encourage multiple theses!All have won, and all must have prizes!Okay if we&apos;re thinking 21st century paradigms - let&apos;s try &apos;mental illness&apos;.Victor - obviously bipolar - I prefer to go back a few decades and call it shame-driven manic depression.The creature, I&apos;m not qualified to diagnose, but if they managed to catch him, he&apos;d be in a forensic psychiatric ward. Along with others with backgrounds which are highly sympathetic if you read about them and who are lovable when you&apos;re having a cup of tea with them - but the sympathy isn&apos;t always in the front of your mind when they&apos;re &quot;reasoning&quot; with you and screaming at you and attempting to bend you to their will and systematically exterminating your friends and family (okay that last bit I&apos;ve never actually experienced, and to be fair I never experienced intimidation during my surprisingly pleasant visits to a forensic ward -   unfortunately I have experienced it out in &apos;normal society&apos;).Adding to that, look at this family system. You couldn&apos;t be more emotionally fused than these two. (at one point I had the creature as Victor&apos;s shadow, hence the revulsion that people are having trouble relating to).And Victor is supposed to be clearheaded enough to sort that out?Having had quite a bit to do with &apos;mental illness&apos; in a variety of contexts, professional and personal - I really wish it were that easy. Victor does very well to start to get a bit of perspective up in Scotland, and then at the end let go of blame and control. Mental illness or not, it&apos;s all we can ever do.;Here&apos;s a website exploring Vampire fiction and Tibetan Buddhism.http://buddhism-for-vampires.com/I like it, and I thought it might provide an interesting point of contrast.;I thought the De Laceys got servants because Safie brought money with her?;The creature had me     until I saw     &quot;the sun setting     behind the stupendous mountains of Jura&quot;.          To continue my prosecution:          The creature screams his &apos;reason&apos;, bends Victor to his     will, and systematically exterminates his kin. All the while he     blames Victor, denies applying pressure (&quot;..instead of threatening,     I am content to reason with you&quot;)....and plays the Victim card! My     creator made me do it. My parent&apos;s neglect made me do it. My     attachment disorder made me do it. Society made me do it. And most     explicitly, the foundation of his argument, &quot;I am malicious because     I am miserable&quot; - Misery made me do it.          And he wins over the jury of public opinion (the readers)!!!!! -     everyone loves the monster, right? - all based on Victor&apos;s     testimony (a parallel to Justine&apos;s fate ironically being sealed by     Elizabeth&apos;s evidence?)          Oh, the mind games!!!          Folks, this creature has been playing us for nearly two centuries     now.          He reminds me of another intelligent, eloquent guy - the     Unabomber: &apos;Technological determinism made me do it&apos;          The &apos;reasons&apos; are all versions of &apos;Necessity made me do it&apos;.     Deterministic arguments, causal arguments, arguments denying free     will.          Meanwhile, there are plenty of violent offenders in the world. All     of them could persuasively and validly call on at least one     of the arguments given above, (given a ghostwriter as sympathetic as     Victor).          The creature isn&apos;t a monster. He&apos;s human. I get it. Every monster     is.          So, what do we do? Whither justice?          Meanwhile, scientists, often as blinker-visioned (read     &apos;hyperspecialised&apos;) as Victor and Walton, are off Discovering more     causes of causes, preferably the causes whose manipulation suits     their sociopathically violent corporate funders and the politically     immune criminal banksters (hehe, sorry, got a bit of a roll on     there. Don&apos;t worry, they have good ghostwriters/lawyers).     As in the novel, &quot;society&quot; is, corporately, stupid and criminal.          So, what do we do? Whither justice?          Victor, not yet quite out of Necessity&apos;s grip, tries to convince     the crew to that they &apos;must&apos; pursue their suicidal mission of     Discovery across the Arctic. It&apos;s a testament to his cautionary tale     that they are free to ignore him.          Meanwhile, thanks to humanity&apos;s unwitting technological choices, we     now make that voyage across the Arctic quite comfortably.          So what do we do?;I see &quot;Jonathan&quot; and &quot;John&quot; as distinct names, with &quot;Jonathan&quot; being closer to &quot;Nathan&quot; than to &quot;John&quot;www.behindthename.com/name/johnwww.behindthename.com/name/jonathan;</string>
            <string>That said, we now live in a time when suicide is not a sin, and capital punishment is (to the liberal mind) never justified. Presumably the reverse was true 200 years ago?;&quot;until the end of his life&quot;, exactly. Here&apos;s another point where Victor is redeemed, only at the very, very end.When Victor is finally able to open himself to love, he finds himself in the company of the spirits of the departed.In contrast, the creature at the end admires and potentially loves Victor - but to him Victor is merely dead.Only a pure product of mechanized science could think themselves absolutely alone in the universe. (especially with Walton right next to him ;)     );Mar, I hadn&apos;t heard of Godwin - your take sounds intriguing. Shelley&apos;s literary world continues to blow my mind! I&apos;ve just been introduced to Kropotkin via Dmitry Orlov&apos;s The Five Stages of Collapse, which you might like (by the way the banking suggestion doesn&apos;t sound naive at all) - fascinating to think Frankenstein has something to do with the roots of modern anarchism.Emma, I think the &apos;child&apos; take has some validity. Certainly he has the emotional intelligence of a six-month-old. Do we exculpate the creature because he&apos;s a child, or see him as a child because we want to exculpate him?On &apos;things that force our hand&apos;, see below.Anonymous, join the club. After a bit of self-compassion for the child I was, I&apos;m in less of a prosecutory mood today - interesting - thanks.--------I was probably too busy being cute to do justice to the theme of &apos;necessity&apos;. I think it&apos;s a word worth tracking, along with with others to do with freewill and determinism (the scene where Victor rejects the idea of a bride for the creature is the only one where &apos;voluntary&apos; enters his vocabulary).Editor Peter Fairclough has the folllowing as a note to Victor&apos;s mention of man&apos;s &apos;superior&apos; faculties making them &apos;only more necessary beings&apos; than the brute animals (Chapter 10):&quot;William Godwin&apos;s pet theory was that the Principle of Necessity, which denies free will to man, rules the world.[and this was made fun of by some author called Peacock]&quot;Well, look at that, I had heard of Godwin, but missed the connection. Fairclough&apos;s note led me to say elsewhere: Necessity, not the creature, is the real monster.;The &quot;how&quot; is that he read Albert Magnus and other such &quot;Occult&quot; books.;Okay, granted. I&apos;ll try to be more precise. Here&apos;s my take:The &quot;how&quot; is that he dabbled in magic.Magic transforms one&apos;s consciousness.Victor thinks his attempts at self-initiation have had no effect. He has unconsciously transformed his own consciousness.Victor is the narrator. He&apos;s unconscious of the &quot;how&quot;. That&apos;s why it&apos;s not &apos;narratively robust&apos;. As Professor Rabkin hints, he&apos;s not an entirely reliable narrator.;Again this is where, unlike the creature, Vincent finally realises there is such a  thing as free will - i.e. the female might have something to say about it.The creature idealised a small child - then destroyed it once it deviated from his ideal.He put to death a girl who was unlikely to sleep with him.What would he do to a woman who said &quot;no&quot;?;Hi Jeremy, I went and sought out the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and there are huge connections throughout. A Wizard of Earthsea is also the book I thought of after reading Frankenstein. ;I sought out some of Percy Bysshe Shelley&apos;s work. It&apos;s really hard!As we&apos;re reading &apos;A Modern Prometheus&apos;, this from Mr Shelley&apos;s Preface to his Prometheus Unbound, seems relevant. He&apos;s talking about Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost:&quot;The character of Satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs, and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure. In the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse.&quot;The second sentence is relevant because in Frankenstein, the creature reads Paradise Lost and takes it as gospel.The first, because we tend automatically to weigh the creature&apos;s wrongdoing with his sympathetic background (and compare it to Victor&apos;s shortcomings multiplied by his privileged background?).The editor of my copy of Mr Shelley&apos;s Selected Poetry, Harold Bloom, says that &apos;a pernicious casuistry&apos; is &quot;a phrase crucial to the understanding of Shelley&apos;s criticism of Paradise Lost, since it applies to the supposedly Satanist reading of the poem.&quot; It&apos;s probably also crucial to understanding Frankenstein, as judgement is a prevalent theme in the novel, given all the court hearings.&apos;Marlow&apos; singles out Paradise Lost in the prefacethe creature is written so that we have &apos;sympathy for the devil&apos;Darn Mary Shelley, the more I read, the more references I need to follow up!;I think it&apos;s important that the creature intimidates Victor intellectually as well as physically - Victor&apos;s caution to Walton is against the creature&apos;s &quot;eloquence and persuasion&quot;.  From the vantage-point of the 1817 preface, it&apos;s important that the creature experience the &quot;enervating effects of the novels of the present day&quot;, particularly that he takes Paradise Lost so to heart [cue self-promotion: I&apos;ve written about that in this thread on The other Shelley, Paradise Lost, and sympathy v. judgement again ]I think it&apos;s important that, like Victor and Walton, he has studied too much alone, outside of relationship. He comes to think he is the only one who can rise above people&apos;s tendency to be &apos;necessary beings&apos; pushed into stupidity by their words and other mental constructs, he thinks he alone can just get on with people without prejudice. He then straightaway kills William because of a word: &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.And I think it&apos;s important that Shelley wrote a creature that has gripped our culture&apos;s imagination even without any of this!!;There&apos;s a lot about Elizabeth and Victor&apos;s Dad suspecting he was having an affair. Perhaps he was married to his work and to the creature.;Doesn&apos;t the father ask at some stage if the sister-like thing is putting Victor off marriage?By the way, there apparently is a biological mechanism that turns us off the prospect of having sex with someone we were raised with very early in life (it&apos;s been a source of rebellion in countries with very young arranged marriages) - I can&apos;t remember the cut-out point, but Victor and Elizabeth seem above that age.;This interpretation would fit with comparison to The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, where all kinds of spiritual beings come to the mariner&apos;s aid, and the crew see things as well. The whole thing might have happened to avert the shipwreck, the only way it could get through Walton&apos;s head (Walton had read The Ancient Mariner but seems to have got no moral beyond &apos;I hope I don&apos;t come back disappointed&apos;). This all had to be *real* to Walton, not just a ghost story.;I was going to write about this in a different thread and call it &quot;asocial learning today&quot;, but it seems to fit here.To what extent are we, like Victor and Walton, &apos;delaying affection&apos; by pursuing our interests online, in gamified environments like Coursera (I was creeped out when I got to a page that said, &quot;Loading reputations...&quot;).Lee Siegel, in an excellent little book called &quot;Against the Machine&quot;, in 2008 argued that all internet experience tends to become the same, as trading sites, dating sites, networking sites all have the same logic. Internet interaction tends to bring out the worst kind of teenager in us, the popularity-chaser, subtly shaping our performance of self to win the upvotes of strangers. At the end of the book, he gives a poignant description of how, in the final analysis, the logic of the asocial/social online environment all encourages the same lonely, objectifying mindset as pornography.The above picture is from an article (not by Siegel, who doesn&apos;t write from a religious perspective) called &quot;The Conspiracy of Pornography Exposed&quot;, which comes to similar conclusions:&quot;The isolation which networking ironically breeds is a harbinger of a new  narcissism. Self-centeredness seeks seclusion and the license to  exercise control, as do those absorbed with online-selves, surfing a  virtual world of avatars. These pursuits are addictive and buried in  ego-stroking falsehoods designed to affect a stimulating pleasure   a  pleasure isolated from reality. The eventuality is a hunger that gorges  on what can never satisfy. There can be no fulfillment, no consummation.  It is perverse. It is pornographic. In other words, pornography is not  necessarily restricted to    adult    films,    men   s    magazines, and forty  percent of the worldwide web.&quot;;</string>
            <string>When did we start wanting &quot;a classroom that can hold 50,000 students, from 100 countries, speaking  20 different languages and showing up at every time of day and night?&quot;Anyway, I wouldn&apos;t be here if I saw no benefit.My point is not so much to decide which &quot;side&quot; of this argument is right - but to alert us to the continuing importance of the themes of Shelley&apos;s work.By the way, the end of Siegel&apos;s book reminds me of the end of The Social Network.Is The Social Network  the Frankenstein movie of our time?;Hi Maria, we too call it &quot;intrinsic motivation&quot; as opposed to &quot;extrinsic motivation&quot;.;I wonder if there&apos;s some parallel between Owen&apos;s attitude at the end, and the unusual glee other characters have at the sticky end of both Rapaccini&apos;s Daughter and The Birthmark.;This phrase stood out for me too - it&apos;s possible that &quot;eminent&quot; is being used as a noun, but I can&apos;t find that usage in any dictionary. It  is more likely that  &quot;proficient&quot; is the noun, as it appears that way in dictionaries. It is much like the word &quot;adept&quot;, or &quot;expert&quot;.;To clarify: try reading it as&quot;an eminent expert in every branch of natural philosophy&quot;;</string>
            <string>Hi all, I&apos;m still processing Prof. Rabkin&apos;s great lectures from the previous unit.Perhaps we can learn about Oedipal structure a bit more by discussing: does The Island of Dr. Moreau have it?There&apos;s a generational struggle going on - and it seems for a while that Prendick is in a bid to become a Man out from Moreau&apos;s shadow.But Prendick and Montgomery seem already to be &apos;Oedipal losers&apos; from the start. They both failed to find a partner or a worthwhile occupation or a place in London society, and they drift into science out of boredom. They both use science to deny the possibility of attaining Manhood - so they don&apos;t have to take responsibility for their failure. (I love the quote from Prendick: &quot;Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man&quot;).Prendick is for a while galvanised to struggle - but is there an object of desire so that we can call it an Oedipal comedy or tragedy? He seems to end up back as before his journey started, alone in his study, reading.Any thoughts?;Thanks for the responses...in any case trying to see how the Oedipal structure works has helped me find more of interest in the novel than on the first rush through.There&apos;s plenty that&apos;s suggestive of Oedipal themes, even if it&apos;s not all there.Where are the women?   There seems to be plenty of fear of women and sexuality, the way Prendick couldn&apos;t possibly describe the &quot;evidently female&quot; beast/people and their sexual behaviour. When he is galvanised to act, he is trying to save his soul, the soul being kind of feminine. He has a nephew, so I imagine he has a sister.Perhaps the biggest clue is that in the first paragraph of chapter one he rattles off three female names of boats (meanwhile he doesn&apos;t know the name of a man he spent a week with in a lifeboat!!! Who or what is worth naming?).The chapter titles tell a story of their own... from &quot;In the Dingy of the &apos;Lady Vain&apos;&quot; to &quot;The Man Alone&quot;.Perhaps boats, representing escape from London and society, are the illicit object of desire....Oedipal tragedy.;Interesting point about the food, Maria, food seems to be a turning point for Nunez in The Country of the Blind as well. I notice that servant is eventually dignified with a name,;You&apos;re probably right, David.I&apos;ve just read The Country of the Blind, and they&apos;re close to being the same story.Protagonist of the &apos;entitled&apos; classes,is humbled, gets a more realistic view of the world and his dependence on others,and despite alienation from blinkered society,develops capacity for awe.I&apos;m pretty sure The Country of the Blind is an Oedipal romance (Nunez, unlike Oedipus, keeps his eyes).So Prendick&apos;s story probably is too. Prendick acts to save his soul, not just his skin, in chapter 11 (human souls are mentioned in book&apos;s last paragraph as well). That&apos;s likely the licit object of desire.He ends up letting go of the earlier, &apos;compensatory&apos; boats.Reading it this way depends on seeing Prendick as keeping his humanity through the last section of the book. I don&apos;t know. He got it when he   wanted to confront Moreau face to face.I thought he lost it again when, for example, he became inured to the sound of the crying puma. But perhaps that&apos;s a more human response to an extreme situation (and he knows it&apos;s wrong), compared to his earlier &apos;I-can-live-with-it-as-long-as-I-don&apos;t-have-to-hear-it&apos; stance.Still, I didn&apos;t admire Prendick the way I ended up admiring Nunez. He never learned to love people (outside of books), and he still seems misanthropic. But maybe he &apos;grew up&apos; on an &apos;island&apos; more devoid of humanity than Nunez did.;I thought of the blindness in analogy to the blindness of those of us who believe only in the five senses (although I think some have counted up to twelve or more), and how we respond to those who have a higher spiritual or creative vision, or other sensibilities.A real life illustration - one of New Zealand&apos;s greatest writers, Janet Frame, was nearly given a frontal lobotomy. Luckily the doctors got news she had just won a literary award, just in time. (Her story is told in the movie An Angel at my Table).Megan, re:&quot;So to me, the scene where they decide to remove Nunez&apos;s eyes had a  special resonance, because the disabled community as a whole still does  suffer from this idea that only when we all have exactly the same  disability can we work together for equality! This attitude is exactly  why the disability rights movement in my country (USA) has stalled.&quot;Without wanting to deny the resonance for you - you&apos;ve drawn an analogy that I&apos;d mark down if I saw it in an essay, not because it relates to the present but because it doesn&apos;t relate to the story. The people of the country of the blind neither function as a disability community nor identify as disabled. They function as the dominant society.They&apos;re not bringing down a high achiever. They&apos;re dealing with a mental health case.On the other hand, I&apos;m sure the resonance you mention is not irrelevant.... I think you can build a stronger thesis about how that resonance works, without reference to identity politics which I think is something of a &apos;blind alley&apos; with regard to this story.Hehe, I get the feeling I&apos;m wrong, but I look forward to your essay proving it to me :);I read this as a bit of anarchistic thinking. It&apos;s not bare religion that&apos;s being made fun of, but religion that conveniently supports the &quot;state&apos;s&quot; monopoly on violence.;Oh, one-eyed King, possibly phallic, I hadn&apos;t thought of that.I think &apos;rape&apos; is a subset of &apos;exploitative behaviour&apos;, and Nunez&apos;s attitude is exploitative at the beginning.His path out of that towards full humanity, is pretty much developmentally ideal.Starts to see people as individuals, not members of classes.In the beginning just finds women hot, but his desire eventually leads him to actually love someone.Romantic bubble burst, he generalises his capacity to love, and develops a sense of awe.So my answer to your question about which world we live in: some people make it well along that developmental path, others don&apos;t.;Oh, and:Perhaps Nunez shifts in his interpretation of &quot;the One-eyed man is King&quot;At first he thinks, oh, my sight is my advantage over these people.But in the endonce he gives up being &quot;King&quot;......he can afford to open both eyes!;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m a retired University Prof, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, and I am loving being on the other side of the desk.

            <string>Constance, i sampled another one - Elearning and Digital Media - in January where the university team were completely exhausted and overwhelmed by their attempts to keep it interactive, and another on 20th C poetry where the professor had a huge team of teaching assistants who were constantly monitoring twitter feeds and facebook pages etc. Prof Rabkin is low key and probably staying much more sane than the others. I thought both of the others were really beautifully designed. This is more straightforward but effective enough as a literature course.   ;I&apos;m an academic in an Education faculty in Australia. The only way I can see to understand the MOOC phenomenon is immersion. I&apos;m enjoying the reading and the writing is always good discipline.     ;Time differences are so frustrating!  ;I think there is a worthwhile discipline in close reading of a text that is being encouraged in this course. If an essay could have been written without actually reading the text - has no detail or specific reference to the text itself - then i would see it as missing the point of doing a literature class. While historicist readings (and others theoretically informed readings such as psychoanalytical) can be interesting and provocative of new thought, they need not be at the expense of the text itself. Rather a reading, no matter how informed by other frames, should also be anchored in the text. Maybe I&apos;m just old-fashioned...;</string>
            <string>I agree with Julia. Eating a nut isn&apos;t enough to deserve death, (We&apos;ve all snuck an extra cookie sometime, haven&apos;t we?) but to starving medieval peasants, eating more than your share and depriving others of their food would seem like a pretty bad thing to do. I&apos;d also like to add that the story also deals with the horrors of living in an untrustworthy community.  The other creatures basically let the cock&apos;s wife die, but the cock  still has to rely on them to help him bury her. Even if the burial had  gone completely smoothly, the trauma of relying on people who let his  wife choke to death would&apos;ve been really humiliating for him.Remember that medieval villages were really isolated. Because of heavy forests and lack of roads or law enforcement, travel was really dangerous. A village 15 miles away could have a completely different dialect from yours so you wouldn&apos;t completely understand what they were saying. Villagers were basically stuck in the community they were born in, even if the community was horrible, like the cock&apos;s, so a story like &quot;Death of the Hen&quot; would&apos;ve rung true to them. So while I don&apos;t think &quot;Death of the Hen&quot; has a moral in the Aesop fable sense, it has experiences that reflect the dark-age culture it came from.;How would you compare the fairy tales the Grimm brothers compiled to the fairy tales Hans Christian Anderson wrote? They&apos;re obviously from different national backgrounds (the Grimm brothers were German, Anderson was Danish). Anderson&apos;s most famous stories (Snow Queen, Little Mermaid, Match Girl) were originally written by him, while the Grimm Brothers mainly compiled stories from foreign countries and feudal history. I personally feel that the Grimm tales are more focused on power struggles and survival, while the Anderson tales are more focused on personal loneliness.  The Grimm tales are filled with cannibalistic witches, contests of strength, and abandoned orphans trying not to starve. Since these stories were told and passed down from the dark ages through famines, wars, and unstable governments, it makes sense they&apos;d focus on protagonists trying to fight nature and build good lives for themselves.  The Anderson tales, on the other hand, seem to be more about the pain of trying to &quot;reach&quot; other people, like the Steadfast Soldier pining after the ballerina, or the sister in the &quot;Snow Queen&quot; who tries to save her brother after he loses the ability to perceive beauty. Sometimes the protagonist&apos;s loneliness is even attached to a surivival element, like the Little Mermaid who&apos;ll never go to heaven unless a human falls in love with her. Anderson&apos;s original tales were written in the 19th-century, when day-to-day surivival was easier and Europe was exploring Romantic ideas, so it makes sense his stories would be more about connecting with people in the society around you. Basically, I think the Grimm tales are more about surviving literal death. while the Anderson tales suggest that not being able to connect with others is like a kind of death itself. What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I hope we can have more in-depth discussions in these forums, so I want to spark a conversation! :) ;Thank you, Melissa. I did mention that the Grimm&apos;s tales were compiled from tales &quot;told and passed down through the dark ages,&quot; but I feel like I could&apos;ve put more emphasis are their collective, oral nature in my post. Thanks for pointing that out. That being said, I do feel that Andersen&apos;s tales are about more than just his own experiences. They might have stemmed from his personal loneliness and love lives, but for them to have become as popular as they did, something about them must have captured the minds of 19th-century European society as a whole. Consider the boy in the &quot;Snow Queen&quot;: When the Snow Queen brainwashes the boy and spirits him away, he&apos;s only able to think of the world in numbers and equations. It reflects the common Romantic-era sentiment of math and science &quot;corrupting&quot; the pure. Andersen might have had a more personal hand in his tales than the Grimm&apos;s (and some of his tales were still passed down/influenced by nurses and tutors), but I think in the end they too &quot;widely reflect the concerns of a whole culture,&quot; just like the Grimm&apos;s.;</string>
            <string>I did not get a 6 (it was so close...), but I want to learn from the people who did. So I&apos;ve started this thread. Each week, if you get a 6 on your weekly response, it&apos;ll be so cool if you post it here. That way, you can show off your accomplishment, and the rest of us can learn what a good short essay for this course looks like. By the end of the semester, we&apos;ll have a showcase of the best work this class has to offer! I think this thread would be a nice complement to the weekly unit essay threads we just started.;</string>
            <string>seems to me, this quest to find moral meaning in a book that explicitly describes a amoral reality is likely to fail short.   every story here has no good or bad interpretation, which is the point.   ;*morally;stories i write like  David Foster Wallace  but with analyses i write like Lovecraft haha, deep expression, cold realism;</string>
            <string>Hey everyone,This was one story I absolutely loved. Here is what I think about it,There was once a pair of brothers who wrote a story of death. In &quot;The Death of the Hen&quot;, the concept of death is evident to the point of being obvious. However, on a second perusal through the story, we can see the use of death is a ploy used by the author to talk about life. By painting a desolate picture of the consequences that one would face when living a life subject to the whims and fancies of a few, the Brothers Grimm tell us how one should live. I feel that each of the characters was used to describe the different aspects of our psyche. The mice, fox, wolf, bear, stag, lion and all the beasts of the wood followed the cock which is depictive of our Destiny and how everything else follows that. The Mice depictive of sympathy were of no use when it came to crossing the Brook of Tribulation. The Coal of anger proved no help either. The Stone of acceptance helped the cock cross over with the hen but failed with the weight of the rest.   The Hen is the Dream, the aspiration to do something that one loves, and when that was crushed by the Brook of Apathy, the Bride of Vanity and the Willow of Complacence, the Cock, our Destiny could only grieve and die. The Brothers Grimm, in many of the stories use the exact opposite of an idea in order to emphasize it. In this, fantasy proves to be a useful tool for the reader to visualize the various animals and objects as part of themselves. There was once a pair of brothers who wrote a story of life.Also, this was my essay which I could not submit as I missed the deadline by an hour.

            <string>I found this tale also very puzzling at first. That&apos;s why I made it the subject of my essay. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t post it now because I&apos;m abroad and the hotel computer is limited, to say the least. I think it all makes sense if you treat the tale as a dream. I&apos;ll post my essay next week.;Hello ! I&apos;ve managed to copy my interpretation of &quot;The Death of the Hen&quot; here it isAll Grimm stories, however fanciful, follow a clear logic, except one which seems quite nonsensical :    The Death of the Hen   . We might be tempted to dismiss it as meaningless, unless we understand it as the representation of a dream.             The story starts with the cause of the choking of the hen, her greed which makes her break her promise to share the nut with the cock. However, the moral of the story is not, as in most tales, made explicit. One does not draw conclusions in dreams...             The second scene is the quest for water by the cock, in a vain attempt to save the hen. It is centered on a bride, who has to provide him with scarlet silk, which could be the proof of her virginity before marriage, in exchange for her lost garland, which may refer to her being unfaithful. The    unfaithfulness    of the hen is developed here. We can also observe that the cock&apos;s quest is frantic : there is a strong sense of urgency which is constantly impeded, until the cock succeeds in getting water, but too late. The feeling of being obstructed in one&apos;s movement is a very common feature of   dreams.             The last scene is the hen&apos;s funeral. All the animals attend the funeral, and all die while trying to cross the river, without any explanation concerning their death. Even a burning piece of coal, symbol of the warmth of life, is extinguished. No one can pass that river but the cock, whose love for the hen allows him to overcome all obstacles, until he dies of grief, his faithfulness contrasting the hen&apos;s betrayal.             Stretching the interpretation of the story further, we may think of it as the dream of a man whose wife is unfaithful. He unconsciously wants her dead, while knowing that her death would be the end of his world, and the end of himself;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m concerned about the two books not available online for free. I am unemployed and have 0 income, so I have no way of purchasing these books. Is there an alternative book we can read that IS online for free? Because I would rather my not having money get in the way of my grade, considering if there is no alternative, I wouldn&apos;t be able to participate for those whole two weeks, which would be a kick in the gut. ;THANK YOU So much Alimova!! And thanks to everyone of you for your suggestions as well, your all brilliant! ;I don&apos;t know why, but I find their writing style almost humorous. And a bit confusing. While some stories and morals of the stories are obvious, some just elude me. But I find their writing style very abrupt, and with my silly sense of humor that abruptness is somewhat amusing. It&apos;s like they write this whole story, and you think it&apos;s going to have an obvious point to it, then suddenly, completely out of the blue, someone dies. Or like in the Frog prince, you think she&apos;s going to end up kind to him, and that would be what breaks the spell(isn&apos;t that how all the re-tells explain the story? Or am I getting confused with another story?) but instead what breaks the spell is her slamming him against the wall. Nothing at all to say how she fell in love with him, or any of that...no, instead it ends with someone thrown in randomly, who cared about him long ago UN-breaking his chained heart. Um, WHAT? SURE, I could come up with explanations that are just as out of the blue as random characters thrown in, but if the stories are read at just face value, it could be confusing to say the least. But still I get a chuckle out of it. Massive &apos;What did I just read&apos;? Moments coming from reading their stories. ;</string>
            <string>Haha, I knew that, I meant story-telling style, or perhaps- how the stories were written. ;Oh wow!

            <string>I was able to get all my books for very reasonable prices via my Nook.   In fact, some of them are free through Barnes and Noble if you use a Nook for your purchase.   B &amp; N also has the entire works of Edgar Rice Burroughs for a very reasonable price (I think it was $2.99 USD for all of them!).   Some of the books I already have in a physical format, including the Grimm stories and all of the Barsoom series, but some of the omnibus editions provided by B &amp; N have some absolute gems, including some of the lesser-known works of various authors--and occasionally they are available for free.;</string>
            <string>I wondered if anybody had read this book? It is a fascinating study of how the Forest influenced Fairy Stories, linking many of them to the historic ties many European peoples, especially middle Europeans where a lot of fairy stories origibnated, had to the huge forests that existed in medieval Europe.;</string>
            <string>I didn&apos;t develop my love of reading until I was in my early 20&apos;s. I grew up an avid TV viewer and never liked the school assignments where it always seemed to be looking for the symbolism in the story. When I moved to central america with very limited TV availability, I discovered a library where suddenly I found books that I loved. My first love was Stephen King which I read everything I could find by him. I have since read many of the books we analyzed in school and now realize that I missed out on the pure enjoyment of the stories.;The discomfort felt is also used by those who wish to ban books,  such as Tom Sawyer,  from schools and libraries. It is argued that children should not be exposed to the racism and language in these books. But then a huge opportunity is missed for us to discuss our history and the changes that have occurred in societal views towards women or other races. Stories show us our past in order to learn from it and do better.;I just submitted my essay. I asked my 16 year old daughter to read the thesis statement to see if I at least made a strong opening argument. I am nervous about being graded since I don&apos;t have a background in writing essays. I&apos;m in this to learn and grow so I will take any suggestions as constructive criticism and grade with the same idea.;My daughter could tell me what the gist of my essay was which made me feel that I had made my point. She is not taking the course but I hope this shows her that you don&apos;t stop learning even when you are well out of school.;It seems the point made about audience participation is a valid one because one aspect of the oral tradition is to pass the stories on to the next generation. If in hearing the story, you are also an active participant, then you are more likely to remember the story. If you have enjoyed the story, you also want to go share with others, thereby passing the story telling on to others, keeping the traditions alive.;</string>

            <string>But Dracula never actually bites Harker, leaving him at the castle for the 3 vampire women to &quot;enjoy.&quot;   I also don&apos;t remember him actually biting Renfield who was crazy before Dracula comes to England. I think the novel is somewhat ambiguous about homosexuality.;My version of Dracula explains in the footnotes that &quot;indulgence&quot; means permission from the Vatican.;</string>
            <string>I thought of Harry Potter as well when reading Dracula. The similarity I found was in the group of friends being necessary to defeat both Voldemort and Dracula. Several times Harry is told to keep his friends close. Even when he wants to go alone so no one else gets hurt, his friends stand by him. The same is true with the group that works with Van Helsing, they want to leave Mina out of the discussions but find they need her and each other.;I haven&apos;t minded the peer reviews so far. I am getting reasonable feedback and i really try to give constructive criticism (it often takes me several hours to complete the reviews).  The one downside to this system is that we can&apos;t tell if someone is improving. I could have given someone a lower score not knowing that this week they have vastly improved their understanding of the work. Overall I think the essays I&apos;ve reviewed are getting better.;Paul, you are right, I just would like to be able to tell someone that they are improving and to keep trying. If it would stop someone from giving up on the course I think that would be a benefit.;This is the first Coursera course I have taken and I am enjoying the books and discussions. There are other threads that people are using to discuss complaints, mainly about peer reviews. I wanted to talk about the good things in this course and what I have learned so far.I had never read Grimm&apos;s original tales, having been raised on the sugar-coated Disney versions of many of the stories. I actually am glad to now know the origins of these stories. The Alice stories were also a surprise to me since I can now see the amazing use of language in what originally seemed like a only a strange dream story.;</string>
            <string>I have 2 essays to review that discuss stories that were not listed in the course syllabus. Though they are still by Hawthorne and Poe, how can I grade them if I haven&apos;t read the material? Does this count as a 1 for content?;</string>
            <string>When   was learning the alphabet, my parents would give me a book with really cute illustrations and I would beg them to read it to me, because I was so drawn to the illustrations. My mom would just smile and refuse to read it to me and   tell me to read it myself. It really helped because, I liked the pictures so much, I would push myself to understand the text just to know what it said.   :);Disclaimer: I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t read all the responses, so bear with me if I am being repetitive.I don&apos;t think it is possible for anything to be completely pointless. Narrative can be viewed broadly in two ways - What the writers probably meant, and the reader&apos;s interpretation.From a brief background read-up on the Grimm Fairytales, I understood that the stories were meant to aid the efforts of Romanticism and build a national identity for Germany by representing German culture and folklore in a way that was accessible to everyone, including children. From this, we can assume allusions to German culture - such as the use of cabbage in The Rabbit&apos;s Bride (just an example- cabbage is an important ingredient in German cuisine, and stealing that made the rabbit a symbol of the forces that were directly or indirectly attacking a significant part of the local culture)- however random it may seem.As for the subjective perspective, I think we are all free to interpret the stories the way we want to, which opens up a lot of opportunity for creativity. In Death of a Hen, for instance, you could derive the moral that one small selfish act(not sharing   nut) could have more far reaching effects than one can imagine (everyone ends up dying).;I don&apos;t think the readings should make us uncomfortable if we are, within ourselves, and with each other, honest about the fact that all of this is just an objective study of subjective literature. Racism, sexism and discrimination are all just part of the narrative. We don&apos;t personally attach ourselves to any of those things while studying the works, so don&apos;t worry about it too much :);Of course! It would kill literature to treat it entirely objectively, but a degree of detachment could help is deal with the discomfort, I suppose :)  ;When I was a kid, I read Walt Disney&apos;s version of the fairytales before I read the Grimm&apos;s version. And the difference is striking.  I remember being more drawn to the happy endings and pretty illustrations in Disney books, and more averse to the revenge and darkness and eerie illustrations in Grimms&apos; books.  For a child reader, and especially on like me, for whom English is a second language, fairytales were something you use to entertain yourself with and learn language from. So, happy stories were perfectly fine.  But as we grow older, and see more evil in the world, I think we become paranoid and cautious and begin to think that exposure to dark things better equips you to face the big bad evil world. This is why people like  Bettelheim and the Grimms find it necessary to reflect on and symbolically represent the negative side of reality in children&apos;s literature.I personally, however, don&apos;t think it necessary to introduce the dark element to children, because doing that never helped me deal with my fears. In fact, I think a lot of my fears as a child were born from the creepy imagery put in my mind by the idea of evil witches and revenge and torture.  ;I agree! :) For me as a child, Grimm&apos;s tales were just evil and unpleasant. But now, I understand that I should respect narrative for what it is. I have no idea where these things come from, but when I learn, it will be gratifying.  ;</string>
            <string>My mom introduced me to fairy tales at a very young age, she used to read me bedtime stories almost every night. When I was old enough to read on my own, and specifically at the end of my second grade, she gave me a set of Ladybug&apos;s  Well-Loved Tales. As I got older, she gave me more and more books and she always welcomed me into her little library. I read my first full novel when I was 11, the novel&apos;s name was Gone With the Wind :) Since my native tongue is Arabic, I&apos;ve done most my reading in Arabic. When I graduated from high school I was so curious to read all the books I&apos;ve read in their original language, which is English. So, I decided to major in English Literature in college and since then, I&apos;m proud to say, I&apos;ve been reading English written books nonstop.;</string>
            <string>One thing story always shows me is our need to derive meaning and pattern, even if none exists. Bearing in mind the Grimm brothers didn&apos;t write their own stories but transcribed them from the oral tradition that still existed, many of the stories in the collection aren&apos;t very good, but what the one&apos;s that survive into the canon do have charm. This one isn&apos;t very good and doesn&apos;t have much charm. They have a utility, that of entertaining children, the method being the anamorphic devices that so appeal to the infant imagination. Bruno Bettleheim will give you all the psychological analysis you want, but I think the truth of the matter is that its stuff adults made up when they had to entertain kids. The use of animals as a hack technique is to engage the imagination. It&apos;s a technique of entertainment, as in &apos;holding the attention&apos;, not because there is any inherent deeper meaning or symbolism; other that what the reader derives. It is a thing of wonder. In the spirit of which, it seems to say, &apos;conform&apos;, &apos;do not indulge in relationships outside of your type (class)&apos;. It didn&apos;t stop the rabbit, who probably needed some comfort cabbage asap. But I look forwards to being enlightened.              ;</string>
            <string>I really like this, at the moment I read this story I thought the same about appreciating what you&apos;ve been given.I think it goes through the line of wanting something different (in the case of the maiden), and getting it through someone that wants to take advantage of the despair of the maiden. At first it looks like a win-win situation but eventually it evolves badly to the maiden when she realises that she&apos;s getting so much more than she expected/she could chew.I have to do a second reading, but I think I&apos;ll be working on this fairytale for my assignment because even if it seems very simple, it has a lot to work on.;I took it from the point of view that she just succumbed to the temptation of leaving home after the rabbit convinced her, but maybe I&apos;m just supposing stuff.In my opinion she was looking for an adventure, something different in her life and just abandoned everything without thinking of the possible consequences.;</string>
            <string>This is an interesting perspective. I like it. It makes me think of it in a way I hadn&apos;t before. However, the feeling I get from the story is that it&apos;s really about the maiden. The mother and the rabbit are both figures in relation to her.  First she is told what to do by her mother, to send him away. He shows sexual interest in her &quot;ride on my tail...&quot;, and she refuses the first couple times, because her mother is warning against it. But the third time she gives in and goes with him. The cabbage patch represents her fertility and her innocence, and living in a house with her mother represents being isolated and innocent. He comes to take away her innocence, and her mother warns her to send him away. When she doesn&apos;t heed her mother, and is seduced by him, he immediately begins bossing her around, and tells her to cook the cabbage for their guests, which seems a bit like exploitation and putting her on display. She feels lonely and realizes that she shouldn&apos;t have given in to the sexual temptation because this rabbit isn&apos;t that nice of a guy. She realizes her mistake, and returns home to her mother where she will be protected.  I think it is about rebellion and growing up, as well. She doesn&apos;t WANT to be isolated and obedient to her mother forever. She just finds out nearly too late that she will just end up being a slave to the rabbit instead.  ;I don&apos;t think she left for no reason, or just because she&apos;s gullible and non-assertive. When you read the story, everything she does in the entire first part is based on doing her mother&apos;s bidding. This rabbit gives her an opportunity to rebel from her mother and leave home. Perhaps she is curious what he can offer her that her mother can&apos;t.   I think Abigail is onto something.But she traded one sort of submissiveness for another. She went from being an obedient daughter to becoming an obedient bride, and she realized that leaving wasn&apos;t all it was cracked up to be.  ;Leslie, I think the &quot;sit on my tail&quot; DEFINITELY has sexual connotation. The way I read it, was that rather than having no choice but to go with him because he deflowered her, is that he basically led her into sexual temptation; he seduced her. The first two times she said no, but the third time she gave in. She went with him, was &quot;deflowered&quot; but did not want to be trapped into the marriage. She had made a mistake.  I thought it was interesting that there was no father figure as well. Perhaps it is to focus on the fact that the male figure in this story is the rabbit who wants her as his bride, in contrast to the protective, female mother figure.  ;</string>
            <string>But I find it quite hard to understand why the maiden would agree to go to the hutch as the rabbit had offered nothing at all for her!;</string>
            <string>you&apos;re telling me if a rabbit offered to take you into his hutch you would refuse?! :P;sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity! :D;</string>

            <string>good point, but she didn&apos;t know it was dracula then i suppose. so it could be both... the description and the description matching her memory... very nice spot though!;4.5 and 4.4 are good grades. doesn&apos;t seem likely anyone was trying to insult you while giving you such high marks.let me elaborate. i very much doubt peer reviewers are being mean to be mean, but providing effective feedback is a difficult art. there are courses dedicated to just that. mainly because negative feedback will always be unpleasant. it is also the most useful thing to have and the most useful thing for the peer to give. so perhaps they didn&apos;t put it in a way sensitive to you, but most of the time they are intending it as help. especially if they criticize while giving such high marks.as a disclaimer i know nothing of your particular case and am speaking in general... i suppose there may be a troll who does it just to be mean, but i very much doubt it.in fact, it seems to me to show a lack of respect to the opinions of your peers if you (and by that I mean people in general) are not able to accept their criticism. ;</string>
            <string>how many topics do we need about people that are unsatisfied with their peer responses?it&apos;s getting a bit tiring. as i mentioned before, i think this is first of all a lack of respect to your peers and second of all missing the point. when you evaluate your peers you should be learning. the difference is the learning is done by yourself as an individual without someone to guide you. you have to question yourself. but i suppose this is difficult for people who have problems with others questioning them...statistically speaking you will receive the grade and the feedback you deserve, not the grade or feedback that you think you deserve (and didn&apos;t get because your peers don&apos;t know anything because they aren&apos;t experts - i don&apos;t need to be a mechanic to know the car is broken). Example of how it should work in theory from wikipedia: &quot;At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, eight hundred people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds.[4]  This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd&apos;s  individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of  responses with the mean centered near the true mean of the quantity to  be estimated.[3]&quot;In this case students estimate the value of your essay... should work similarly in providing fairly accurate grading in the end.&lt;/end rant&gt;;yes, actually, its quite fascinating how accurate the hive-mind can bee.i should put The Wisdom of Crowds on my reading list to see if it lives up to the buzz. :Dseriously tho, interesting book i imagine...i&apos;m not a statistician, but i don&apos;t think the light-touch median normalisation - and the 10%:85%:5% rules should have a huge effect on accuracy in the end...;i just finished my peer reviewing and i must say this weeks submissions were better overall than most of the ones i&apos;ve had to review before...  so it would seem people are learning! :);</string>

            <string>The Rabbit Bride is a short story in selfishness. The Rabbit is completely obsessed with his own needs, and after relentlessly pursuing the girl, he &quot;gets&quot; her and continues to only consider his needs. She realizes that her decision to go with him is a huge mistake and quickly makes herself a memory in his life. Only then is the Rabbit remorseful and sad. I love how the Bride get out of there quickly with no discussion..........;Can anyone share what they believe is one moral of the six soldiers of fortune tale?;  I believe that the Six Soldiers of Fortune illustrates how each person can use his or her gifts and talents for the greater good.

Edit- Is it possible that when making marmalade out of childhood we are trying to preserve(!) it, in order to help ourselves with it in the winter of our lives, and while doing this, we are also necessarily embellishing it (adding sugar)?;I am terribly confused here. How come, if he can function in daylight, he didn&apos;t do something about being hit in the face with a shovel at the beginning of the novel? Or is it that once he goes to sleep he can&apos;t wake up any more until night-time? ;The few exclamations he makes in Foreign are in fact in German. As for his grammatical constructions, they seem a bit strange for either German or Dutch, and I couldn&apos;t help but feel he was faking his foreignness. Not sure to what end, though. Perhaps it was just me. ;I think the Christianity here is stressed, not so much as a religion, but rather as a symbol of new beginnings and fresh starts and stands in contrast to old &quot;evils&quot; (i.e. not being progressive, slave to tradition, unable to adopt to rapidly changing demands of the new era...) which the Count represents. In this light Christianity and science are in fact mutually reinforcing, rather then contradicting. ;</string>
            <string>Preview button is really useful too. Often when I have copied my text into the entry box and then viewed it on the preview page, it would look totally different. Then all you can do is make the corrections and jump back and forth between the preview mode and entry mode to make sure all corrections are applied properly. You can do this after you have saved or submitted your essay. ;Ha, I wrote an essay on this topic too! My thesis is Victor was so stressed with his work, he finally cracked and imagined the monster and Walton and all the deaths of his friends and family! Work can do that to you.;I think we are to put in that field all the works we used as references, or &quot;works consulted&quot; rather then only those we actually cited. ;</string>
            <string>I found this story annoying too, but mainly because I kept expecting something different to happen (the cock to be angry at the hen for cheating him, the fox to cheat the cock and try to eat the dead hen, the brook to react to the procession trying to cross...). It surprised me that as a reader I am so prejudiced!  ;Hi Mark! I find it helpful to just write on all my ideas at once.  I also start off with lots of notes on everything and write my ideas on all of them. As I go, I can more easily prune some out and stick to the better ones. In the end I have 3 or 4 theses which I can pick from. Hope this helps!;</string>
            <string>Interesting discussions!  I&apos;m reading a lot of greed and gluttony in the Grimm tales so far. Though it seems to me that the poor moral character of the one who desires everything at the expense of the other is what cripples either the morally deficient individual, the individual being used or in this case both!The story before this:  Clever Grethel, shows her justifying her greediness and happily ruining the relationship between the master and his guest by lying to cover her tracks.Notice, also, that Grethel wears &apos;shoes with red heels&apos; and the brook requests &apos;red silk&apos;, the rabbit&apos;s bride used . I&apos;ve thought about this emphasis on red in these stories regarding greediness and gluttony, their effects crippling relationships and causing tragedy, and am struggling to see why it is significant.  In any case, the stories up to this, The Death of the Hen,  have been, in my opinion, centred around greed and wealth. The greedy causing tragedy (The Death of the Hen), tarnishing relations  (Clever Grethel), being usurped (Six Soldiers of Fortune) and forcing marriage under violence (The Rabbit&apos;s Bride). They each show figures of authority - a cock, a king, a master, a bridegroom - and agreements which are undermined - sharing food, cooking food for guests, giving a fair pay, suitable marriage (not necessarily agreed upon, but believed to be so by the rabbit) - and I believe it is a message to authorities. The message is thus: Those who act in a way unjust meet their end soon enough or ruin everything they held dear. The people do not stand for usurpers and will find ways to rebel, like the six soldiers or the rabbit&apos;s bride.   Going back to the colour red, and this mini-conclusion of mine, perhaps the red is for revolution or the church, red being the colour of the cardinal cassock. Any thoughts on my suggestions?;</string>
            <string>Michael, you have no idea how relieved you have made me! My internet has been down for 3 weeks! I thought all hope was lost!;</string>
            <string>I seem to be stuck with this story - which makes me eager to write my essay about it ;-)Two issues I would love to further discuss here!Obviously, some elements of this story repeat themselves in other stories. Hen and cock also go up to a nut mountain in the story &quot;The Vagabonds&quot;. Straw and coal reappear in the story &quot;The Straw, the coal and the bean&quot;. Could you make anything of these parallels?Furthermore, the story includes references to the four elements in certain way. Water (saving and taking life), fire (red silk, coal?), earth (funeral, coal?), air (hen cannot breath). I find it very interesting how they are woven into the story, connected with life and death.Am happy about any further discussion - even though I could not add any new overall interpretation. Maybe it helps us move forward?;</string>
            <string>Please correct me if I am wrong: Aren&apos;t there 5 corrals? In the video, Professor Rabkin was talking about a big corral. Within this corral, there are the four sub-corrals.Judging from your discussions, this does not seem to matter. However, I thought it was my hint towards the solution...?;</string>
            <string>I&apos;ve just started my journey into literature, but here&apos;s my two cents.I believe that rather than blatant ignorance, the cock displayed naivety and blind devotion. Although, this didn&apos;t particularly turn out too well for him in the end.Although the hen was originally at fault for breaking the deal and deceiving the cock, perhaps he believed that this was no reason for her to die, so he set out on a quest to retreive water for her. He did everything he was asked of, without question, so that he could brink water for the hen and save her.  The latter part of the story reminds me of a song from the Wicked soundtrack: &quot;No Good Deed Goes Unpunished&quot;. This is because the straw and the coal offered to help, but eventually doomed themselves, and the animals they were trying to help. Only the stone was effective in getting them across, so maybe this is a lesson in that one must have a strong base in order to get through tough times.  My take on the story is that the cock is a devoted man, whereas the hen is a dishonest woman. Their relationship falls apart because the woman cheats the man, and everyone dies (but maybe the fact everyone died a sad death is an exaggeration on being loyal to someone who is not loyal to you).Or I could be speaking gibberish. Possibility.;</string>
            <string>the site also provfides a link to html plain text, which won&apos;t give you the illustrations, but averts the issue with the pdf...i.e. when i downloaded the pdf file, all the illustrations were there, but the text didn&apos;t come with it;I just fell into the same trap... Sat down to write the essay, and found I was too late. Grumble grumble. Really? 9 AM on te west coast is too late? Well, I gues I get to try again next week;So, I missed my &quot;assignment due&quot; Date... BLERGH! On the bright side, that gives me an opportunity to post my thoughts here, and I&apos;m not limited to a measly 320 words. On the other hand, I&apos;ve already watched the post-reading lectures, and have therefore taken on the &quot;taint&quot; (using the term loosely) of the professor&apos;s   analysis.Professor Rabkin has certainly made many very astute observations and has, with the help of established research, provided us with a thorough analysis of the works of the Grimm Bros as a whole and in detail. He has provided us with the Male, Modern, Urban, Christian, Western view of this collection, or rather, compilation and subsequent re-write of these tales.I come at this from the viewpoint of Female, Anachronistic, Pagan, and neither western nor eastern, perhaps a more Indigenous (in the sense of &quot;connected to the older ways, or to nature&quot;) way of looking at things.Taking into full account the aspects pointed out by Professor Rabkin, i.e. the underlying nationalistic agenda, the rampant sexism and intentional archetypal programming of gender roles, societal behaviors, religious views and prejudices, I&apos;d like to call your attention to a couple of other things I&apos;ve noticed or have had pointed out to me over the years by friends and mentors.As much as bread and wine are the nourishment of the Christian sacrament, milk,   honey, grain and meat are the proper foods for the Gods for many northern European and Celtic Pantheons. These Pantheons include strange beings, often referred to as &quot;Faerie&quot; or &quot;Elves&quot; &quot;Albs&quot; (btw, an alternative etymology of Albion, or the names Alban/Albert and similar, is Alfar, or Elf, &quot;Albion&quot;, therefore, could also be construed as the land of the Elves).   While, to most of us, in the context of the modern world, such beings, be they demi gods, nature spirits or denizens of a frightful night, will seem unreal, and one&apos;s insistence on their existence will meet with anything from friendly ridicule to accusations of insanity, at the time the stories were published in their written formDISbelief in these beings was just as much considered an insanity.Now, these tales were laid down at a time when, despite the efforts of the Inquisition, a couple of centuries before, some people still remembered, taught and studied these older forms of knowledge. At a time when there wasn&apos;t a central, proscribed and conveniently censored curriculum for the majority of young students, these tales provided yet one more way to discredit the old ways, by portraying the wise crones as evil witches, the young and pretty airheads as the winners, often by defying or overcoming their ill portrayed elders. Cleverly, the writers left just enough small bits of the old knowledge in these stories to make them seem credible; i.e. who, at that time, DIDN&apos;t know that woman&apos;s moon blood is one of the most powerful magic substances a human could get her hands on? While making most traditional magic the tools of the opponent and therefore programming society into thinking that the tools themselves were evil, the Grimms furthered the cause of the Christian faith to disregard and revile views and beliefs that went against their patriarchial agenda. Incidentally, generations upon generations of women were programmed into domestic docility, rejection of their bodies, intuitions and innate skills, often at the cost of our, admittedly different, but sharp intellect. At the same time, men were programmed into thinking of women as inferior, therefore not worth listening to in all matters of advice, or as readily exploitable, since women were &quot;worth less&quot;. Maidens (daughters) were programmed into disregarding the wisdom and advice of their elders, those barren witches (oh, yea, while you&apos;re at it, look up the etymology of &quot;witch&quot;, and, if you think I;m WEIRD,... do yourself a favor,... look that word up too :-) )Now we are left with a MESS. Several generations of alienating ourselves not only from nature, due to the loss of society&apos;s knowledge of every natural life and thing as a fellow being, but also several generations worth of deeply subconsciously ingrained behavioral patterns that are counter to natural balance but are presented to us from day one,.. gender oriented clothing, the difference in toys, books or acceptable activities, etc etc. The disregard of one gender for another and vice versa, the outright prejudice against other cultures or deviants within our own are well established behavioral patterns due to our early programming, when the pathways in the brain are still malleable.   We have, to a large extent exported this buggy program   to other cultures accross the globe. The Brothers Grimm have done a marvelous job, Now, how do we undo it? Responsibly? Without putting something similarly faulty in its place?;</string>
            <string>I think that&apos;s a good interpretation, Jai, but I also think there&apos;s a less positive interpretation here in another subversive element - the weak/poor/commoner one-upping the rich/powerful. It&apos;s a common theme in fairytales, especially the early ones, and in this story I think it opens up another possible moral: not just working together to better society, but working together to subvert the established power.;I think all of these are interesting possible explanations, and personally, I like the numerological background - the number three has always been important, far pre-dating Christianity, and trinities have been a vital part of divinity and spirituality for thousands of years. Maybe the threes are not just to help us remember and interact, but to warn people early on that something important was coming? Before we recognized the pattern and integrated it into our schema.  ;It&apos;s definitely one potential moral. In this case, though, I think it was more meant to be an amusing bit of feminist subversion - Grethel is very clever and the men she deals with are easily duped morons. Even more telling, Grethel isn&apos;t just the clever &quot;winner&quot; in this story, she also sets all the men against each other. Of course, there&apos;s a bit of critical male perspective in this adaptation for the fact you pointed out - Grethel is the female representative and she&apos;s a selfish, manipulative liar.;I think you&apos;re both right - fairy tales are always in some way about morality, but it doesn&apos;t have to be an obvious or even a firm stance about what&apos;s right and wrong. I think this story, like the others, is meant to be open for interpretation. Like Alan said, this was a very strictly controlled and religious time, these stories are meant to be subversive, quiet rebellion against the social order, not an affirmation of its opinions.;John, that is one definition of a fairytale, but it&apos;s a narrow one. There is more to them than reinforcing social norms, but if you must think of it that way, then consider that these stories (in historical context)  are reinforcing social norms, but new and subversive ones, and new versions of morality. Alan, there&apos;s always hope. :);</string>
            <string>I think that the moral is that if like the king you don&apos;t pay what you owe at due time, you will pay more in the long run. The king was beaten a number of times   and refused to do the right thing, in the end he lost his kingdom.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m surprised that Alice doesn&apos;t make any sense to someone too, Paul.Like  Anna Levchenko above, I grew up on Russian translations. My family actually owns at least three different versions (Demurova, Nabokov and Zakhoder), not counting the radio play that I&apos;ve been listening to my  whole  life.  This is my second time reading the books in English and I have to admit that gaining more understanding of English culture didn&apos;t change my perception of it. Perhaps it&apos;s precisely because it&apos;s a part of my childhood and I&apos;ve learned about afternoon tea from Alice?  The only thing I remember ever confusing me was croquet. I don&apos;t know the rules, never seen people play it in real life and not sure of its significance :);</string>
            <string>Looking for parallels between Alice &amp; Doctor Who would be such an interesting task. Thanks for the idea!  ;</string>
            <string>I am loving this thread.I would also like to vote that Doctor Who fans should now be called Wholigans instead of Whovians.;</string>
            <string>I had never really thought of it like that... I&apos;ll have to look for some parallels between the two. I haven&apos;t seen the seventh Doctor though, I&apos;ve had problems getting my hands on the Classic Who... ;</string>
            <string>Rumpelstiltskin is attributed with female skills such as spinning, baking, brewing or dancing. He feels pity for the miller&apos;s daughter. He says about himself: &quot;I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world&quot;. At that point he is in total contrast to the king, who is simply interested in gold.  The first time, the king sees all the gold, he is astonished: So he never thought it being possible to the miller&apos;s daughter spinning gold out of straw. This may implicate two meanings: Either he does not care at all about a human life or he plays a quite cruel play to the miller&apos;s daughter in threatening her with death, maybe to force her to admit the truth: that she is not capable of spinning gold out of straw.Rumpelstiltskin gets the necklace and the ring. Maybe he takes a burden from the miller&apos;s daughter(?):The necklace may stand for being chained to someone or something, the ring as a visible sign of being engaged. He allows her extra time to think of his name. Does he act so because he underestimates the miller&apos;s daughter&apos;s ability? (like the king never thought of her spinning ability?) Why does he not fear the possibility, that she may tell the king? He puts himself into danger at that point. Does he know that the miller&apos;s daughter and meanwhile Queen will not tell her husband the truth? That she will more likely risk to lose her child?The Miller&apos;s daughter does not try to defend herself in front of the king. Why does she not speak for herself and tell the truth? Why does she think: &quot;But who knows whether that will happen?&quot;   Does she not take for serious her situation?   Rumpelstiltskin at last cries: &quot;The devil told you that!&quot; How may we understand this? The devil is the only one, who knows Rumpelstiltskin&apos;s name? Or that, like Faust, she does not hesitate to beg the devil&apos;s support? (Do you know the Lilith-Myth in the Talmud? Lilith was Adam&apos;s first wife. She was equal to him and not willing to get into submission. She knew God&apos;s secret name. When God in Adam&apos;s demand tries to force her to be submissive to Adam   and him, she cries out loud his name and therefore gets banned from paradise into desert.) So in the Christian-Jewish tradition there is a secret around God&apos;s name. In the end the Miller&apos;s daughter becomes a very powerful Queen. She ascends socially and her child stays with her!   Hope you find my thoughts on Rumpelstiltskin interesting!;It&apos;s really fine, that you liked my comment.I watched somewhat closely to the brewing and baking thing. In a German encyclopedia   &quot;Bier-Lexikon&quot; I found an article about the brewing origin (title: Einst war das Brauen Frauensache - which means: There was a time when Brewing was a femals business). Very famous was the Holy Hildegard of Bingen for her universal knowledge and one of her skills was the knowledge about beer brewery. But you may go back in history even to the old Germanic People: in these times the women brewed the beer.Going back to the Brothers Grimm: they were part of the Romanticism movement in Germany at that time. They wanted to create a new intellectual world, referring to their german origins. The Romanticists were idealistic, highly sensitive intellectuals, poetrists, philosophers, scientists, artists and musiciens of all kinds. They came together in so called &quot;Literarische Salons / Jour fixe&quot;, which, by the way quite often were arranged by sophisticated young women like Rahel Levin Varnhagen, Henriette Herzberg or Dorothea Schlegel   discussing their philosophical, aesthetical or social ideas.In these movement quite a lot of famous women became writers (Caroline von G _nderode, Madame de Stael [who was a french artist], Bettina von Arnim). Here   a new intellectual world opened its windows to women and men. This was quite new!;I read your post and felt really touched . I had a time, when I was not able to read any kind of literature without detecting racists, mysogyne or else discriminating implications. I gave up reading for a while.  Than I started to search for those hidden traces of female or else subversive, fragmented culture or discourse. What I think is really important is to find reflections on your own feelings, abilities, desires, confessions or maybe prejudices?! This is, what reading and reflection on myths and motives in literature really means to me.During the last summer I read some of John Irvings novels. I don&apos;t know, whether or not Irving is a persona non grata in the American literature scene, but I really liked his openmindedness to personal concepts. I found, which is really quite rare among male writers, that he loves his female protagonists, he loves all kind of bodies, especially the imperfect ones. The most intact, sane persons in his novels are those, who are female and male attributed characters, the closer to 100 %female or male they come, the more rude or stupid or simply disgusting are theyThink of that and be at ease with yourself. You are who you are. We are all in different ways disabled, imperfect, not mainstream, not fitting in those aesthetic, social or gender common places. Maybe a great deal of writers felt that way to -which lead to their writing and our reflections on it!;Dear Megan,Owen Meany is own of my all-time-favorite novels. I totally agree with you. I enjoyed reading this book and I really loved Owen!As to Barbara Kingsolver I don&apos;t know her yet, but I&apos;m always   thankful to discover &quot;new&quot; as we call it &quot;Lesefutter&quot; (reading food, so to say). Thank you for your insights.Andrea;Megan,Thank you for your short &quot;book review&quot;: I will keep it in mind, since it sounds/reads really interesting!;It&apos;s not necessesarily obedience and/or beauty which leads to the &quot;happy end&quot;! Look at the princess in  &quot;Frog Prince&quot;: she breaks the curse in being disobedient and rejecting the inappropriate, even disgusting demands of the frog (and her father!).   The step-mother in &quot;Snow-White&quot; is beautiful, but she needs to be the most beautiful of all. Her envy and recklessness, her life-threatening attitude towards Snow-White leads to her terrible death. Snow-White is the most beautiful of all, but she is arrested in a quasi death status from the very beginning. She, not unlike her step-mother, lets herself over to seduction of pretty things. Finally she becomes a &quot;beautiful jewel in a tresor of glas&quot;, really beautiful to look at and placed on the top of a mountain, so that everybody may see her! Spitting out the treacherous, seductive apple is the healing (with which she has been fed by her step-mother).;I really appreciate the article you posted here, because it refers to a variety of gender aspects discussed in this forum. One of my favourite questions is this: &quot;Why did we lose all those male counterparts to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and the girl who becomes the wife of the Frog King?&quot;My simple answer would be: Because the boys, when they came of age, entered the real, challenging world: They went abroad, journeyed to foreign countries in the trading business, as students or (most exciting) as explorers like Georg Forster or Alexander von Humboldt, they became independent. Whereas the young, well educated, intelligent women stayed at home, in the golden &quot;bird-cage&quot; of their fathers or husbands. Where could they travel else than in their fantasy? Why should they tell stories about dragons and ogres and female knights? They wanted to be powerful queens. They wanted to be admired and loved: because if they were not in reality, can you imagine such a life of tristess?The Grimms collected &quot;their&quot; fairy tales in a quite comfortable, completely unmagical way: they found female narrators in befriended families: these pretty, sophisticated, intelligent women. Than, because the female versions were at times quite slippery and too obviously connotated with female (especially sexual) needs, they overworked them, made them attractive to a possibly male, quite more often to an audience of children. (You may find interesting following links on 2 German magazine articles: http://www.zeit.de/zeit-geschichte/2012/04/Maerchen-Brueder-Grimm-Urspr _nge: &quot;M _rchen  _ber M _rchen&quot; and http:www.zeit.de/2012/50/Brueder-Grimm-Maerchen-Roelleke: &quot;Weder deutsch noch Volk&quot;; Heinz R  lleke is a Professor emeritus of German Philology and an Expert on the Brothers Grimm).Hope you like my comment;Exactly! A lot of them   (and maybe those who became the most famous ones) were of French origin. First the Grimms did not know themselves. When they knew about it, they kept silent, because they wanted to work on a real German folkloristic collection. Of course in a sense they made them their own: because they overworked them.I was astonished myself when reading these Articles!;As I am mother of two girls (12 and 10 years old) I have a perspective from both sides:   as the story-teller of bedtime stories to my girls and as a former child listener to these stories.Yesterday we (girls and I) talked about the Grimm fairy tales and it turns out that they both have different favorite ones. The older one loved the seven raven; she was really scared about Hansel and Gretel, especially about the witch. The younger one loved Rapunzel and Sleeping beauty (Dornr  schen) and The Goose-Girl.   Both found their way to understand the tales and ignore those parts, they were scared of or which they didn&apos;t really understand. When they were very small I &quot;censored&quot; the stories, where they were extremely punishing to the vicious step-mothers. My younger daughter yesterday evening begged me to read Sleeping beauty and Snow-White to her. She had a good night&apos;s sleep afterwards!I myself, when I was a child,   loved the Grimm tales: My favorite tales were Hansel and Gretel and The Beauty and the Beast (which was no Grimm tale but a French one). Of course I enjoyed a lot of other fairy tales too, but these were my favorites.The &quot;In&quot; and &quot;Out&quot; as you put it is most certainly sexually connoted. During my reading of the Household stories for this course I stumbled over some interesting sources in a German magazine, Die Zeit online. It is said there, that the Grimm brothers collected a great deal of their tales from young, well educated women. The fairy tales often were so obviously sexually inclined, that they overworked them to make them more &quot;children-compatible&quot;. You may read my other posts on this theme under the post &quot;Dealing with Bigotry&quot; and &quot;Representation of women in Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales&quot;.;Did you use other interpretations, texts, literature sources to underline your thesis and your thoughts? You have to specify it and name the origin of your quotations. These are the &quot;works&quot; you have &quot;cited&quot;, as I understood it.Hope I could help you!;Yes, you will find extra space for that on the side. Beneath the place for your essay!Good luck!;</string>
            <string>In my opinion, a good writer is able to create both the most adorable person and the darkest, most hideous creature. I&apos;ve met characters that made me laugh out loud, others that made me cry, some that I fell in love with and even dreamed of. Some that made me fear of falling asleep and others that left me with a disgusting feeling, hating the world. I don&apos;t believe that every character is a part of the author. Some are, but some I believe, are what the authors hate, or afraid of. Or simply, they are inspired by stories they hear, or people they know. ;Until a few years ago, I thought that reading out of my comfort zone was a waste of time. I didn&apos;t see the point in science fiction, I didn&apos;t care about fantasy novels in imaginary worlds and fairies and stuff like that. I started reading these kinds of books because of a challenge in Goodreads. I never regretted it. Every kind of book has something to offer, every genre and (almost) every writer. It&apos;s   very important to know when the book was written and understand why the writer had the opinions he/she had. I don&apos;t mind reading about slavery, because it&apos;s a part of history and that way I may learn and understand the society of that era, even though I&apos;m against its beliefs. And let&apos;s not forget, if we were born in that era, in a family with such ideas, we probably would think slavery is a natural and necessary thing. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I feel very strongly against any kind of bigotry. What I&apos;m saying is, when I choose to read a book, I take under consideration all that stuff, and try to take the best I can from each one. Besides, how can one be against or opt for something, if they don&apos;t know what that something is? ;I agree! I missed the first week, since I just enrolled today, and I &apos;m starting &quot;Alice&quot; now, while the video will be released tomorrow. Also, I like reading two or even three books simultaneously, so I think having the &quot;before&quot; videos released all together is a great idea!Lastly, I &apos;m a slow reader (I was delighted to hear  Professor Rabkin opts for slow reading), so I may not be able to catch up on one unit. I want to be able to prepare for the next ahead of its time. ;</string>
            <string>So, I&apos;m reading Alice now and I also follow the discussions on the forum of the unit. I&apos;ve found some additional essays and books, like Cliff notes, Alice in Wonderland and Philosophy and Annotated Alice. Here&apos;s the question I have, not just for Alice, but for every book we &apos;re going to read: do you read the book first and then the additional stuff? Or do you choose which to read before, during and after reading the book?;</string>
            <string>I have similar experience to you regarding reading Disney&apos;s and Grimm&apos;s versions, as English is not my first language either. I found that in my culture fairy tales are also a bit cruel and darker than the happy-ever-after endings of Disney&apos;s. As I grew older, I too have started to appreciate that fairy tales (in any culture) contains wisdom more than just telling stories. Nevertheless, although I agree that the dark elements may cause trauma, I think we shouldn&apos;t leave them unnoticed either. Perhaps we should take more cautious ways of introducing the dark elements to the children. What do you think?;</string>
            <string>You&apos;ve made a very clear point, John, thank you.I came to the Discussion Forum looking for answers and the first one I read (yours) dissipates all my doubts. It is true, the name of the course indicates the POV from which we are suppose to be looking at the stories: a neverending interpretation of our modern world and how we explain our existence and that of others in it.;</string>

            <string>The peer reviews will be interesting to read. Criticism of any sort, will be greatly received, the first paper will be to figure out exactly what to strive for the future writings. Rereading these tales brings back wonderful memories from childhood.   I think I was very upset when I realized that animals couldn&apos;t talk!   I think if I ever come across a, &quot;white snake,&quot; I might have to try a bite to see if I can understand what the animals are saying.   ;</string>
            <string>I have been contemplating myself, exactly who or what the Queen of Hearts represents. An adult world seems a plausible approach.   As a child, the lessons that we learn and ingest through &apos;language&apos; and the playing of &apos;games,&apos; indicates that if we learn to play correctly or say the right things, we get something what we desire.   This is not the case in, &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; and also in the real world. Confusion surfaces throughout the story when she tries to adjust to the riddles and language of her cohorts. She gives up at some points and pursues her stance on others.      The Queen promises and executes her threat non-stop, possibly similar to how we are forced to deal with various illusions of people   s perceptions throughout childhood and adulthood.   Alice stands up to her and makes her confusion and anger known.   Therefore, she must deal with the consequences of making a decision of standing up for herself or ultimately growing up. Just a thought:) I might write my thesis on this but not quite sure.;I am glad that I reread these stories.   I believe them to be very interesting and bright. I certainly did not think this before.;Thank you, Bethan Morgan, I thought of reasons to explain why I never took a liking to Alice and your explanation makes sense to me.    I can place myself in many characters when it comes to literature, but not Alice.   Although, I now can understand a tad bit more, I still am not as interested in this book and poor, poor Alice.  ;</string>

            <string>I have submitted mine :) I really enjoyed the process of reading and deciding on what to write about. It was challenging fitting it in to a small essay though. I haven&apos;t written essays in such a long time so I&apos;m anxious that it won&apos;t be good enough, but I tried my best and had fun at the same time!;I had lots of notes too. I found that it works for me to do that. I wrote down everything that I had observed/thought about in the tales and read back on my notes with a highlighter, to see if I could pick out any themes. I then decided to go for the theme that I felt the most comfortable writing about.. It&apos;s a good sign that you have the notes! Your mind might &quot;feel&quot; blank, but the notes on the page tell you otherwise. Don&apos;t panic! Good luck :);Sorry to read that you are quitting, Olivia :( Hopefully you will be able to take the course again at a later time? I agree with those that say you might as well pop by and read the discussion forums, and read the books at your own pace. You could then enrol to the course at a later date. However, I hope you change your mind and stay! The workload can make you feel overwhelmed at first, but remember that the course is designed to be fun! You don&apos;t have to put too much pressure on yourself. Just go at your own pace :);Glad you were able to submit :) I found it daunting like you because I haven&apos;t had to write an essay for a while, but once I got in to it I enjoyed it.  ;</string>
            <string>Yes the children were a surprise.   Rapunzel was locked in her tower when she was 12, which is a marriageable  age for pre-industrial times.   The King&apos;s son visited her repeatedly so one can infer after the fact.... that most likely they were his children.   I;So perhaps that is overstating it a little bit but the old fear I have not felt in aeons is back as I face a menacing deadline and fragments of ideas without substance floating in my mind.   Anyone else finding that breaking the ice for the first assignment is a daunting prospect?   It&apos;s been far too long since I have had to try to actually formulate an idea for an audience about a story I&apos;ve read.   Hoping to get something to submit so I can continue on in the class.   Tantalized  by our professor&apos;s promise that if we can read the materials and write the essays we will improve by the end of class.;Thank you.   I kept my focus narrow - one story and one point - and got something together to submit.;Glad to hear.   I also found that once I started I was able to get something pretty easily.My approach was to start in a text editor exploring my theme and bringing in lots of story details... a rough cut of notes on my topic.I then read through what I had written and began a summarization of just the main theme and a few supporting examples to pull out a cohesive thesis.   Hope others find it enjoyable.;Yes, gaining confidence in writing is what I am aiming for also.   Glad to hear!;That is so exciting.    Would love to read your submission.;</string>

            <string>Sexton&apos;s RapunzelEveryone in this forum might enjoy Anne Sexton&apos;s revision of the Rapunzel tale in her collection Transformations, in which Sexton offers her verse-versions of the tales. She take themes from the originals and lets them play out. In the case of Rapunzel, the witch more explicitly exhibits sexual desire for the young Rapunzel, wanting to possess her in every way but also needing to hide away to do this triply transgressive thing (bondage, rape, homosexuality). Sexton explores the darker underpinnings suggested by the tales but also delights in that darkness. When the prince arrives to seduce Rapunzel, it is as if the whole of &quot;normal&quot; society has reasserted itself to rescue her from the witch&apos;s depravity. But the tone is hilariously light: he &quot;dazzles her with his dancing stick.&quot; In the Lucy Crane version, apart from the use of the word &quot;wife&quot; that follows right on the heels of the prince&apos;s visit, there is also a tantalizing detail a couple of lines later when we learn that the witch and the prince trade off seeing Rapunzel during the night and day (though the witch doesn&apos;t realize this at first). Rapunzel is poised between traditional socio-sexual norms and the opposite. But, crucially, she seems to choose the prince (whereas she gave not consent to her bondage by the witch, clearly). As a way of reinforcing Judeo-Christian norms, the Grimm tales are not afraid to evoke fear and loathing.;The Freudian analysis (which I suspect we&apos;ll encounter throughout the class, given Prof. Rabkin&apos;s proclivity) is certainly not the only reading; it&apos;s one among many, and some may object to it vociferously (if I can &quot;say&quot; that online). I, for one, found it a stretch in Hansel and Gretel. Given that many of the originators of these tales were spinning women, I can imagine a very different set of intentions animating those characters. As far as the back story goes, of course we invent back stories and futures for our characters, or we&apos;re tempted to do so. From early childhood, we&apos;ve wondered &quot;and then what happened?&quot; BUT, when you invent a back story, whether you&apos;re a professor or not, you are inventing, and you have to offer the kind of support that will make that invention compelling and/or convincing. In the case of Hansel and Gretel, I find it odd to give the father any kind of central position. He&apos;s utterly emasculated, and I can&apos;t see why we should read him as the ultimate desire of Gretel. Also, I think Prof. Rabkin gives Hansel short shrift when he argues that Hansel is basically a minor character who enables the females to duke it out. He exhibits cleverness and resourcefulness, if a lack of foresight with the crumb thing. In fact, he is a primary agent of their survival, whereas Gretel is the agent of revenge.   Rabkin needs Hansel to be minor because  he needs the &quot;crumbs-are-feminine&quot; thesis in order to support his larger reading across several tales.   Instead of the Freudian reading, I think the story reflects the importance of food for sustenance, the terrible things that the hungry might do for food, and the breakdown of the traditional family when the father can&apos;t keep his family happy, safe and well-fed (as we&apos;ve seen, the tales reinforce a traditional  Patriarchal social model, and when that falls apart, bad things happen...women in control of families do bad things).  The gingerbread house is odviously another added bonus: to warn children away from excessive sweet consumption. The step-mother and witch  are two sides of the same coin (one won&apos;t feed them; one wants to eat them)--they are both associated with the corruption of love (food), not so much with procreation (except as that follows from food...which is less compelling, though it is Rabkin&apos;s argument). There&apos;s a lot more to be said, but I&apos;ve got to go...suffice it to say that we don&apos;t have to accept the Freudian reading as authoritative, just interesting (and compelling for some).;</string>
            <string>This isn&apos;t productive. ;</string>
            <string>Work is its own reward? Tell that to Sysiphus! Isn&apos;t the point of this thread to determine whether other students have received valuable feedback, not whether they have found value in writing their own feedback? I have found the comments pretty interesting, so I&apos;d hesitate to be dismissive of the general discussion! ;Why would one have to avoid the phrase &quot;crop up&quot; in a &quot;serious&quot; essay? Remember, good literary criticism exhibits insightful, detailed and well-developed thought, not necessarily high diction. Beware of academese, and say what you think in the clearest language you can summon. ;&quot;Crop up&quot; is an idiom that has been used in vernacular but also &quot;legitimate&quot; sources, figuratively, since at least the mid nineteenth century. Apropos of this thread, not all feedback is helpful feedback. As long as the phrase was used correctly (in terms of its meaning), there is no good reason to quibble. ;I think a major source of frustration might be the lack of feedback from instructors. When you have no sense of your critic&apos;s credentials and his or her comments are too brief and/or they seem unhelpful, you naturally begin to wonder whether you should care what they say.... ;</string>
            <string>Interesting perspective, Kathleen. I see Cinderella (&apos;Ashenputtel&apos;) as less about the significance of her beauty but more the significance of her industriousness - as we also see in &apos;Mother Hudda&apos;. I agree that the physical representation is used as an indicator of the behavioral attributes, particularly in accompanying illustrations and film representations, but really Cinderella&apos;s transformation is in terms of outcomes rather than her clothes. Maybe I&apos;m misrepresenting your perspective, but I don&apos;t think that the Grimm brothers were motivated to produce content for popularity&apos;s sake! Whilst they were attempting to collate &apos;volks tales&apos; which had a universality, there is an undertone of morality, and especially around &apos;staying in one&apos;s place.&apos; This is true across the Grimm collection, in cases where the nobility / royalty are the protagonists (as in &apos;Sleeping Beauty&apos;) as much as peasants (&apos;Hansel and Gretel&apos;). In a most fundamental sense, as these stories outline basic human needs (food, sex, desire for power and money) and the conflict that arises from an imbalance in relationships around these, they remain timeless and their themes continue to resonate. ;</string>
            <string>Could it also be linked to Peter&apos;s  betrayal  of jesus, where he denies him three times by  repeating  the same sentence?I was reminded of that.  ;</string>
            <string>I was struck by the recurrence of threes in these stories, too. I did a little research and discovered that apparently Jewish tradition states that once we have done a thing three times, we are connected to it and it is connected to this world. (ref: The Watchman, http://www.betemunah.org/three.html). Perhaps when things were repeated three times in some of these tales, that moved the doer (i.e., the murdered Queen who appeared in the form of a duck in The Three Little Men in the Wood) from the spiritual world to the physical world and thus made him / her &quot;real&quot;.;</string>
            <string>I am so glad to be able to read through the forums everyday!Three seems to be the magic number for all story telling, whether it is written, oral (Spoken or sung) or interpreted. In theater, we learn the magical quality of the number three. Three times is funny, three times is suspenseful, three times memorable. More than three times on any subject, or line in the telling of a story begins to wear at the receivers ability to stay interested and the relevance of the message.;</string>
            <string>I had assumed that the use of three was connected to how we remember.   I appreciate the input of the three times is memorable but more than three times it dilutes the message.   I had always thought that to be true but it is good to see that it actually comes from somewhere.   I am also struck that three is fairly consistent with actions and number, but if the number of children (sons or daughters) referenced is more than three it is typically seven or twelve.   Which if I&apos;m remembering correctly those numbers also frequently occur in nature.  ;</string>
            <string>We are dealing here with both &quot;repetition&quot; and &quot;variation&quot;. I also believe that this repetitions could be a trace of oral literature, a  mnemonic function. But this doesn&apos;t mean that it doesn&apos;t have a  rhetorical  function. The &quot;repetition&quot; establishes similarities  between two characters (Brother 1 acting exactly the same as Brother 2) while the &quot;variation&quot; points at the differences (as in Brother 3 acting differently than Brother 1 and Brother 2). In this cases, it could be useful to pay close attention at how the action is told: how the same event is represented each time. In this case, a small variation in the language or the actions can be giving us insight about the character and his/her own evolution.;</string>
            <string>In the video it says &quot;all of the Lucy Crane translated stories plus one.&quot; Which Grimm&apos;s fairy tale is that one? ;</string>
            <string>Hello all. This course unit is the first time I&apos;m reading the original (at least, early translation) of a proper Grimm&apos;s Tales collection, and I just found the representation of women a little hard to swallow. Is it just me, or are the women in the tales divided into two basic categories:(i) The damsels in distress like Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella who get rescued from their troubles by princes and(ii) The negative characters of stepmothers, witches, etc. who are the only active women but, like I said, are cast in a negative light?Also, what&apos;s up with the evil stepmother stereotype?There are few exceptional cases of women like Grethel in Clever Grethel who are not explicitly evil. Yet, they are not exactly portrayed as virtuous either.I found it hard to discover too many virtuous women who made things happen. Is it simply a social stereotype of the time?;Yes, certainly there is no dearth of portrayals where virtuous and good women are concerned. I just did not like the fact that it seems the same are also required to be docile, timid and oppressed at the same time, in most of the tales. &quot;Vivacious&quot;, for instance, is not an adjective I would be able to attribute to many heroines of the tales.;That sounds really promising. And a radically altered view in comparison to Grimm&apos;s tales. I&apos;ll look up any available translations as soon as I can!Thank you for this post! :);</string>
            <string>I got a 5 too! :DAnd same issue: peers said I could have expanded on some points. I am glad they did acknowledge the fact that they&apos;re aware I am on a tight limit, though. Overall I am very happy, especially with the comments. I found some fascinating additions to my view!;</string>
            <string>There are some evil women, who are pretty. In Aschenputtel story two step sisters are described as beautiful and fair yet &quot; black and ugly at heart&quot;  - this is very different to popular nowadays version. ;Thank you for posting it! ;</string>
            <string>Hello Reeti!I found your comment very relevant!I  definitely think you are right about the womans place in the tales, maybe has to be related to the time when those has been written, but i found &quot;six swans&quot; a little bit different about the tales that you mentioned, theres a heroine and save her brothers by her kindness and pure heart, i know it sounds chessy and her mission coul be perceived as a cliche, but i think is a good try to give us a better place in literature, dont you think?;</string>
            <string>I think a lot of the submissiveness and silence is about controlling female sexuality, too. Several of the heroines have to be silent (keep their mouths closed) to save their enchanted brothers or whatever. Keeping one&apos;s mouth closed is a stand-in for keeping (ahem) another hole closed. And female speech is linked with heat and fire, also indicating sexuality; speaking to the iron oven, getting burned at the stake, and so on. So women being so silent and passive is an indication that their bodies and sexuality are controlled by men.  ;Absolutely - and women can&apos;t go on quests because if they roamed freely around heaven knows what they might get into - or who might get into them. It&apos;s all about containment, so that men can be sure their children are really their children (especially in a pre-paternity testing world). Because heaven forbid that a man should pass his property on to someone who doesn&apos;t have his genes.;</string>
            <string>I have to say that this story is fascinating, but about as bizarre and incomprehensible as many of the others.   I am strongly considering writing my essay about this story, but I can&apos;t for the life of me figure out what they were trying to say.   At the same time it seems to criticizing Grethel for her drinking and gluttony and selfishness, but then she uses her cleverness and comes out on top.   Your interpretation seems as good as any, but shouldn&apos;t they be taking a stance on whether or not her actions were moral or not?   After all, this is a fairy tale.   ;I always thought of fairy tales as needing a moral.   I thought they were meant to teach and reinforce social norms.   The whole idea of telling stories to children is to impart on them your cultural ideals and knowledge.   I can&apos;t really understand what the point of this type of story is without that.   Perhaps you are right that these stories are just about showing children how the world works.   My mind keeps coming back to that and then rejecting it.   I just find it so hard to believe someone would write stories for children to tell them that the world is random and uncaring.   ;Lindsay, I&apos;m not sure that is a narrow view of fairy tales, though I think I phrased it narrowly.   Fairy tales and oral histories are what define a culture. They provide continuity from one generation to the next.   They don&apos;t just reinforce social norms.   They also provide a common understanding of morality and of the world.   These stories, having been collected and edited by the Grimm brothers, seem to lack in any of that to me.   They remind me more of a child telling me a story that doesn&apos;t really make sense.   It&apos;s just sort of &quot;And then this happened, and then this happened, etc.&quot;   I guess I&apos;m just having trouble with this material.   I&apos;ve already read some of the stuff we will be covering and I&apos;ve enjoyed it and I&apos;m looking forward to reading the rest of it, but not these.   I keep trying to come up with a thesis, but then I try to look for a counter-example, and I always find one.   I tried looking at the relationship between Grethel and her master to figure out what it said about gender relations at the time or what it said about class relations. On the one hand, they seem to be treating Grethel as a bad person with their descriptions of her, but on the other hand her cleverness wins in the end.   She doesn&apos;t even have any growth as a character.   It&apos;s just so baffling.   Maybe I&apos;ll try to focus on a different story.   ;The reading does seem a bit intense. I feel like I should have read everything before the course actually started, instead of just reading two of the books.   I&apos;m worried I&apos;ll end up writing some of the essays without getting through the books.   It would be easier if all of the &quot;before you read&quot; videos were up right now so we could feel a little more comfortable starting the readings whenever we were ready.   ;I&apos;m doing the same, but I always feel guilty about it.   With the Grimm fairy tales I was going to start first, but then I saw that there were &quot;before you read&quot; videos getting posted every Thursday and I decided to wait for that.   That was clearly a mistake.   ;Patricia, maybe that&apos;s true, but I was pretty annoyed when I did my reading, wrote my essay, and then went to watch the videos and based on the professors lecture, the whole basis for my essay was apparently wrong.   I know an online course has to be different from a class one actually goes to, but I keep thinking that would have never happened to me in high school or college.   I wish I could just take my essay down now and have nothing turned in rather than having everyone who watched the video lecture and then reviewed my essay just tell me how wrong I was.   ;Emma, Kim and Julieta, Thank you for your encouragement and your alternate perspective.   I will say that I felt better when I did the peer review and saw that others did the same thing as I did.   I was just a bit dismayed when I tried as hard as I could to figure out what the Grimm brothers were trying to say, what the moral of one of these stories was, and then I watched the video and the professor basically said that these stories didn&apos;t really work that way.   I felt like my whole essay was one big mistake.   ;</string>
            <string>Actually, there is a book that mixes the two quite well.   The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss starts in third and comes back to it from time to time, but most of the book is the main character telling his life story.   Without giving any specific spoilers, there is a very sad scene at one point in the book.   The narrator tells us the events that happen to him, and it is already pretty powerful.   Then the scene ends and it jumps back to third person and you see the reactions of the two people listening to his story and him trying to brush it off and such.   It made it much more powerful.   The thing I will say though is it first person is a bit harder to do.   The voice for third person can be a bit more bland.   It&apos;s sort of just giving you the facts.   In first person novels, the narrator is a character, even if he/she is not actually involved in events.   Whether or not the narrator is likeable becomes important.   ;</string>
            <string>Why does a story have to take a moral stance on people&apos;s actions?   I think what differentiates a lot of these stories from, say, Aesop&apos;s Fables, is that they illustrate how the world really works rather than try to define some moral ideal. I&apos;m sure that then, as now, in real life good doesn&apos;t always beat evil.   They are in many ways subversive given that the other teachings around were more than likely religious where good is always rewarded, even if it is after one is dead.;Lindsay, glad you agree, that was one of the themes of my essay so hope you get to mark it   :-);Actually these weren&apos;t written for children.   I always thought they were as well.   I went to Wikepedia and read their page (I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s accurate!) and found that they were German adult oral history and that in fact in later editions by the Grimms they had to be changed to make them more suitable for children, for example instead of kissing the frog to turn it into a prince the original story has the prices throwing the frog against the wall.   They changed wicked mothers into wicked step mothers, and who knew Rapunzel was an unmarried mother?   They took out most of the sex and left in a lot of the violence, something we seem to do today that always seemed the wrong set of priorities to me.;To continue my thesis, I think it might be wrong to think of these stories as being generalizations on everyone&apos;s morality, or lack of it.   I see it more as &quot;some people will do this sort of thing so be aware of it as you go around the world&quot;.   There are others where people gain and lose a lot of stuff but end up happy (is it called &quot;Happy Hans&quot; or something) some where good deeds are rewarded and some where they aren&apos;t, just like life.   In the &quot;Three Spinsters&quot; the girl gets out of doing work, is seen as clever for doing so, marries the prince and the three honest, but overworked and as a result ugly, women she dupes end up invited to the wedding so everyone lives happily ever after;</string>
            <string>But they are logical, very, isn&apos;t the point that in real communication ambiguity abounds so that if you apply strict logic you can end up in some funny places.;Don&apos;t flood your house :-);I think that really is over thinking the whole thing.   Dodgson field of study was logic and I think he just loved to play around with words and structure showing how arbitrary and ambiguous communication can be, and of course he was doing that to amuse small children.   We learn by play and when we play with our language (puns) and sense of reality it helps that learning stick.   Play =fun=humor, so many jokes are based around the logically defensible but unexpected outcome, my kids&apos; favorite was &quot;if your feet smell and your nose runs, you could be built upside&quot; down, which is a close kin to &quot;what&apos;s black and white and read all over?&quot;   the answer to which is of course, an embarrassed zebra...or not;PS, I think I would argue that the answers to riddles always are &quot;logical&quot; if looked at with the right frame of reference;Suzanne, this is an interesting discussion that has set me thinking as to why I am not offended.   Part of the answer is has been expressed above, they are just stories, but when you get past that where do you go?   Personally, Grimm&apos;s   tales are not stories I would tell my children today.   However, they are there and part of the history of fantasy and as such have their place in this course.   Perhaps looking at them in that way, and contemplating how far we have come since they were written, can put a more positive spin on them.   The world today is not violence free but was much more violent in the past, perhaps these stories were preparations to assist people in understanding what might happen to them in their life.   Even today we are not short of violent stories but we protect our children from them by rating movies etc.   It&apos;s an interesting balance, protecting and at the same time making sure our children know how to handle life in the raw when they are grown up and outside of our influence.   How many of us have actually seen a person die?   Yet it is a place we are all going and I am not sure just hiding death as much as we can is a positive thing.   I&apos;m not advocating televising hangings but some familiarity with the process might remove some of the dread and fear about something we are all going to experience at some point.   Another point, these are not the only violent books around that are considered universal and revered, both Shakespeare and the Old Testament are pretty bloody when you get right down to it.I have much more difficulty with your reaction to the Alice Books.   The &quot;Off With His Head&quot; is an empty threat, somewhere in there either the Gryffon or the King says that it never happens so in my mind the Queen becomes a source of humor just like someone having an empty headed tantrum.   It shows how silly people look when they go around making empty impossible threats.   The rest is so chock full of playful puns and silly logic that it has amused children for a long time.   We need people who have flexible thought patterns, not rigid unchanging beliefs, if we are to improve civilization (at least in my opinion) so this sort of playful &quot;logic&quot; is a great teaching tool on how ambiguous rules and words can be.Hope that helps;I&apos;m thinking about using, as the theme for one of my essays, the relationship between the reading and a more modern piece, in other words what are the common threads and how I think this reading influenced more modern fantasy and SF.   The instructions say not to discuss the reading in modern terms but I take that more as in instruction not to do something like using the story of Cinderalla to debate the plight of women in the 1800&apos;s and how much of that plight does or does not remain.   My point will be to focus on the piece as a foundation for more modern writing, tracing a lineage.This will be somewhat in the vein of the last lecture where Prof. Rabkin pointed out the Greek myth roots of the fairy tales.   Any comments and how would you score me on the content part. I&apos;m on my own on the grammar argument clarity and structure, I know that and based on my first set of peer reviews I have a way to go!;Anna, thanks for the comment, you&apos;ve put your finger on what concerned me and that I couldn&apos;t articulate.   I might try and change but of course my head is now full of the original idea and empty of anything else, not that it was ever that full to begin with.   On the other hand this is only the second essay and I am not too hung up about passing as I am doing these courses to keep my 60 something brain ticking over so it might be worth sticking with my thought just to see how peope react.   If i do your comment will be really helpful.Ditto to anonymous;The problem summary:As I did last week I wrote my essay in word and then did a copy and paste, word shows me at 319 word count, the coursera system has me at over 400.   Even after I completely deleted all the text the Coursera system still showed me with a word count of 109 on the first time I tried even though the box was blank, the second time there was some series of characters there, looked a software list, the third time the word count was over 200 with a blank box.   I cannot complete my assignment as the system is blocking my input because my word count is too high.   It is due tomorrow morning so I urgently need helpSteps to reproduce:Screenshot:;Thanks Patricia, I knew about the difference you pointed out but this is much bigger than that, it&apos;s well over a 100 word difference so I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the issue;It turns out that Word sometimes adds a bunch of formatting information to a document that you can&apos;t normally see but which got carried over when I did a cut and paste. It was this that added to the word count.   I had to use a Mac version of word, apparently you can also use a plain text editor;Thanks Kate, I finally took a look at the added stuff and concluded it was Word formatting information but I couldn&apos;t strip it out.   I tried again with the version of Word I have on my Mac at home (The original that gave problems was done on my Windows PC at work and I e-mailed myself a version at my home address) and it now works so either you did something or this was a Windows Word versus Mac Word difference.   ;An interesting mixed bag, two that were obviously from non English writers, one that had a very thin thesis and two reasonable ones.   I have to say though I don&apos;t think mine will come back with a gold star, I sort of took a flier on the topic going off in a weird direction.One thing, Freud has a lot to answer for.   Why must people drag (and I mean drag kicking and screaming) sex into everything.   I get sexual innuendo in the fairy tales and in Dracula but in Alice!   I don&apos;t know that the Victorians understood the concept of adolescence and struggling with sexuality, and eveb if they did I don&apos;t know if it was a problem at 7!   I find it much more believable that it&apos;s all about the bewildering set of adult social rules and strictures that a 7 year old would have found strange and meaningless.   Please don&apos;t go from Victorian social mores to repressed sex, I understand that but you know sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.    End of rant!!!!;</string>
            <string>So, the votes are in, it came out as a 4 overall, better than my last one, with two really enthusiastic reviews (not necessarily of my grammar and punctuation though!) and one who made the point that it didn&apos;t really help or enrich him or her in their reading of Alice.   Now on to Dracula!;OK anonymous I think I can see your tongue firmly planted in your cheek here, sorry Bethan but I&apos;m English and Orange Marmalade would trot off my pen just naturally without any deep thought about the color, or would it be colour....;I had the same essay and the same problem, the last coursera course I did had a zero as an option.   I wonder if we could have just not rated it and rated another essay to meet the required number.   I think I&apos;ll post on one of the technical boards and ask that question.;The problem summary:Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:;</string>
            <string>Having re-read the instructions I think that&apos;s right, if 5 people all give this essay a 1 for form and a 1 for content then the grade the writer will see is 1 not 2.   Only if they all gave it a 2 for form and a 2 for content would they see a grade of 2.;Yep, though about that after I looked at my grades, what you actually see doesn&apos;t make sense based on the instructions, no one should be able to get more than a 3.   How did you find out you got a 2 for forma and a 3 for content, I don&apos;t see that anywhere, just a single number for the overall grade;Ah see it now, it&apos;s buried further down in the peer review page;Very clear, thanks for posting;Good comment, and I speak as someone who so far has two 4&apos;s and a 3.5.   However, one reviewer even suggested English might not be my first language.   As I am English, not even American, that was a severe blow and a considerable motivator to pull out my grammar and punctuation reference books next time !   :-);I think the confusion is over the averaging of the scoring described in the instructions.   Several people pointed out, that if everyone gives an essay a 1 for form and a 1 for content, then the over all grade given will be a 1 not a 2.   You have to read carefully to get that.   The original question started based on the assumption that the grade would be a 2.   With that said I think the problem goes away.;I don&apos;t think you have to have a single thesis, the instruction says you should aim to enrich the reader, it is not specific about how you must do this.   I do think you have to have a coherent structure and any observation you make about the work has to be backed by reason so by definition you have to have some sort of thesis.   You can&apos;t just say, I like vampire stories, you have to say why this particular vampire story is interesting.   I think that I would mark a piece well done if someone stated up front that they wanted to give me, say, three insights into the story and if they then did so (hard in 320 words).   However, I don&apos;t accept people just rambling in a disjointed way.   In other words, if you have a single point to make, do so clearly, if you want to make more than one point, say so and do so clearly.;</string>
            <string>Dodi, I think you are right about some leeway needed for people whose first language is not English.   However......one of the comments I had back on one essay suggested that I was struggling with my punctuation because perhaps my first language was not English.   It was done very nicely but it was something of a humbling moment as I am English by birth (not even Australian, Canadian or American!).   It certainly made me pick up the pace a bit and reach for my reference book on grammar and punctuation.   :-);</string>
            <string>Russian fairy tales are abundant with golden apples and golden birds. I think there should be a biblical analogy as well. Perhaps the mixture of both. However it can be considered as an initiation tale like Hercules  ;</string>
            <string>I got confused by the time difference between Europe and the States and missed the deadline for peer reviews. I &apos; d like to know if I can still get a certificate if I do the rest of assignments? I was assessed by the peers and really sorry for not being able to do so in my turn. I will join the opinion that 2 days is too short to assess as many students work and have a family... ;Thank you very much ;</string>
            <string>Many of the elements in the Grimm tales can be traced back to pre-Christian motifs and stories - specifically Norse ones, but there&apos;s some Celtic ones in there as well. Those older stories can in turn be traced back to even older stories, which were likely taken across with different migrations of people and language over a long period of time. It&apos;s my understanding that there&apos;s an awful lot of conjecture about the Indo-European precursers (Linear A and Linear B I think) which means that these story elements are similarly best-guess theories. That being said, there was a lot of trade along the Silk Road since at least the Roman times, and stories would have been exchanged forwards and backwards over that period. With humerous mistranslations, one imagines. ;)I&apos;d love to find out if there are any story motifs which are shared with the Aborigine peoples in Australia, because they&apos;re the oldest continuous lineage of people and story that we know of. Although the Amerindian tribal heritage would show a lot as well, because again they were isolated for a long time.My guess is that there&apos;ll be loads of things which are culture-specific, like ... seven swans, or golden fruit; but there will be more general ideas, like rewarding innate nobility and punishing the selfish, which are more universal. Whether that&apos;s from our pre-literate ancestors before they migrated everywhere, or because most surviving cultures have similar attitudes towards rewards and punishments, is not something I want to make a guess about.;I didn&apos;t realise how much cleverness was rewarded, even when the person being clever was committing criminal acts. And as a feminist, there really wasn&apos;t much in there that I was happy with. : / Too many damsels in distress and innocent women being falsely accused.I was struck by the repeated story elements though - certain stories seem to have come from even earlier ones, and then split into multiple forms. It was interesting to be a story archaeologist for a little while, although I didn&apos;t write on that topic, too much to say about it.;</string>
            <string>Beautifully put Emma, i lol&apos;ed.;FInished both books today and wrote what I might lovingly term as a &quot;totally half-assed&quot; essay and turned it in. I feel greatly relieved.I&apos;m really not sure what it is about these books that annoyed me so much. Although I can pin a couple of things down - I hated the Disney cartoon, which was my fist exposure to the story; as a brunette with two blonde sisters, I really dislike blonde vapid heroines; I don&apos;t like dream-sequence stuff generally so two entire books of it just seems excessive - I can&apos;t quite place why my reaction against it was so strong. It is very masterfully written. There&apos;s a lot of stuff in there that&apos;s an English lit student&apos;s dream come true.I would love to know if anyone else feels the same way. Conversely, if you think this is the best thing since sliced bread, feel free to try to persuade me otherwise.I&apos;m really looking forward to Dracula. Give me high gothic horror any day.;Thanks for that, I missed your thread before. I think you&apos;re right that I rushed it, but I was engaged in some serious diversionary tactics at the start of the week and ran out of time before I knew it. Lesson learned. Hopefully.;I loved Dracula when I read it years ago, I found it much easier to read than I was afraid it was going to be, with moments of wry humour that I just didn&apos;t expect. It&apos;s not really a horror story at all, more of a classic redemption-through-love theme with some nice religious iconography. It&apos;s perfectly possible to view it as a doomed romance as well (I love those, I&apos;m firmly in Team Eric&apos;s camp in Phantom of the Opera too).;I had a big problem with the ink elephant scene in Dumbo as a kid too. Conversely though, I thought The Fountain was amazing, and that had a lot of dream-sequence like things in it too, and I adore all of Sandman. I think it depends on the level of absurdity for me. My dreams are usually much more... real-world rational I guess, so I just don&apos;t understand the appeal of stuff like Alice.;You make a valid point there, I don&apos;t really like private-language things generally, and whereas with Sandman I can sit and feel clever for getting a good chunk of them, with Alice I&apos;m a century out of date for the social stuff and a doctorate in Mathematics away from understanding the pure maths elements I am assured it contains. I like Shakespeare though and I&apos;m even more out-of-date with that...I forgot about the heffalumps and woozles. I didn&apos;t like them either. I think it all made me feel slightly nauseous as a kid. I dunno, maybe it was too connected to having high fevers and presumably hallucinating a little bit when I was really little with infections... but that&apos;s a stretch. Although I did find all the characters and descriptions of things in the books much less off-putting than I found them in the film, so it might just be a visual thing, I get pretty travel-sick. Of course, I could just be over-thinking the whole thing. Maybe it is just that I don&apos;t like blonde younger sisters who get to have all the fun while their older sisters have to be boring.;There&apos;s still an area in Germany called Saxony I believe. In Britain, we call them Saxons, but I think they were actually mainly Angles, hence England (Angle-land). Usually in diasporas you get some people staying behind too, so it&apos;s certainly feasible.Or Stoker might have gotten it wrong. He did that more than once. As an Irishman he might have been trying to make a snide political remark that the English were, in fact, total foreigners with more in common with the Germans than with the Irish.There was a lot of anger about the English in Ireland at the time.;4 of the 5 essays I was assigned were on growing up. It&apos;s nice to know that this was a much more common theme than just my own sample. I have to admit, I mentioned childhood in my essay too, but only in reference to identity crises, I swear!It would be interesting to see a breakdown of essay subjects, but I think that would be pretty complicated to do.;I found your essay interesting as well, you made some very good points which I certainly hadn&apos;t appreciated before - Alice as child provocateuse is a very interesting take on it. My experience of essays is similar to Anna&apos;s the first paragraph should contain something which states what the subject of the essay is about, just as the conclusion should basically summarise the whole argument (which yours did admirably).As a native English speaker I noticed a few errors, but nothing which really stopped me from understanding what you were saying. And your grasp of academic English is much better than most of my countrymen&apos;s.Normally I would criticise someone for using the first person at all, or for using anecdotes, but in your case you managed to make the essay more interesting and relevant, and I was fascinated by Ecila = power. That was an unintended result though; I think it would better illustrate an essay about the deliberate puns and palindromes in Alice (I think there are some palindromes anyway, I remember loads of terrible puns).All in all your essay was really interesting and enjoyable. I think I would have given you 2 for form - your use of the first-person was offset by your excellent vocabulary - and 3 for content, as you genuinely made me think about the book in a new way. (And a much more interesting one, I might have liked the damn thing more if I&apos;d thought about it like that.) Thanks or letting me read it. : );</string>
            <string>She&apos;s more an agent of the plot than an active participant, by which I mean she doesn&apos;t really act of her own accord, things are enacted on her. Describing a woman as having a &quot;man-brain&quot; isn&apos;t a compliment; it&apos;s saying &quot;only men can be clever and you&apos;re clever so you must have the brain of a man&quot;, which might make her feel complimented but is still an insult to her entire gender. I grant you that the book allows her to be clever and valued for it, which was part of a change in society at large, but she&apos;s still very much a passive participant in the novel. The only exceptions I can think of are when she acts to care for another (Jonathan or Lucy), which is a traditionally female (and thus societally acceptable) thing to do.I love the book, I truly do, but it&apos;s not good feminism at all. (I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s better than Frankenstein though, from what I remember about the plot in that. Ironic, really, given that Shelley was the daughter of the most prominent British feminist thinker of her day.)Your point about the old world vs the new world is a good one, thanks for that.;That is the essay I wanted to see on this topic. Superb work. You did an incredible job.;I&apos;m a native English speaker and I&apos;ve studied a number of European languages, which has sensitised me to the grammar errors non-native speakers of English make. I&apos;ve received a few essays to grade so fr which are obviously (to my eye) written by a non-native speaker, and this affects my instant judgement about the grading of the Form part of the essay - any mistakes stand out. I have not, so far, penalised anyone for the crime of not being completely fluent in a language not their own, because there&apos;s no fluency requirement for this course, However, I&apos;m not marking all of the essays.I would like some guidelines published about this subject please, so that we as a community are more consistent in our treatment of this. I wouldn&apos;t want to punish someone for something that&apos;s not their fault. I&apos;ve tried so far to be constructive and to give examples and explanations in my responses to the essays in question, but not everyone is going to do that, because of a lack or time, or understanding of their own, or just because they don&apos;t see it as their responsibility. As a UK native, I&apos;m also aware that I might be the victim of an over-zealous marker myself, given that my spellings are UK English rather than US English, but that at least works both ways.I&apos;m not sure this is the best place to ask about this, but I can&apos;t find any other way to get in contact with a member of the team, so this is my only option. It is sort of a technical issue, in some ways...  The discussion was raised in this forum post  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=370  if you want to see how it came about. Thanks for your time.;The fact that there are two different interpretations of the same loose guidelines in reply to my original post suggests that a little more clarification could be beneficial, no?;I agree with Anna and Megan&apos;s points. I&apos;ve given that piece of advice in both course markings so far, and I received it on my first essay too. The times where I gave it have been where someone touched on what I found a very interesting idea as a throwaway line, when the essay was about something completely different.When I received it, it was more like the scenario that Megan described, although I was definitely of your opinion, that the essay was about the whole idea (justice) rather than the individual parts which made up my argument (justice at the hands of the law, justice at the hands of nature/magic, the stories as a means of social control, and the evasion of justice by the powerful or sufficiently clever). I learned my lesson in the Alice essay and kept it much more tightly focussed. The essay I wrote for the first topic was definitely the one I put more work and thought in to, but it really needed at least another thousand words to, er, give it justice (sorry for pun...). All of the points I&apos;d touched on would have individually made a great 300 word essay, but as a whole I agree that it feels too crammed with ideas.My Alice essay stuck much more closely to one idea (loss of identity) and was a tighter essay accordingly. (I got a 4 for both of them though. Go figure.) I still illustrated the point in different ways and mentioned different examples (identity as tied to one&apos;s nature, and how children construct the identity of others this way almost exclusively), but the theme of the essay ran through it much more effectively than my first one had. It remains to be seen whether I can keep the same tightness of focus through the course though. I get pretty waffle-y. You might have noticed.;</string>
            <string>Caitlyn is whiny and annoying, and deliberately so: if you compare her to Daenerys and even Cersei, she comes across as totally unwilling to take responsibility for herself or to rock the boat in any way. Both Daenerys and Cersei exist in a man&apos;s world too, and they both find ways to work within and fight against the system.That&apos;s an aside point really though. I&apos;m finding Victor more like Sansa, a passive participant in his own life for the most part, who feels trapped by his nature when he finally gets round to analysing himself. The monster... more like the Hound, but more annoying.;Whilst I am a little frustrated at the feedback, or lack thereof, that I&apos;ve received so far in my essays (apart from that person who said they hoped they&apos;d get another essay of mine to read, I HEART YOU), I&apos;ve noticed that the process of peer-reviewing is making me better at writing these essays. For me, the big thing is seeing how other people are thinking and writing, and that&apos;s both interesting and helpful in and of itself. Looking at the peer review that way, it becomes much less of a chore (I swear I spend longer on the peer reviews than I do on my actual essays) and much more worthwhile.You can always post your essays on the forums for more reviews, if you want to see if your grades are representative. It won&apos;t improve them, but it might help.;I happened across a snippet of information which I thought might be found useful by everyone.Mary Shelley wrote this book in 1816, after a miserable summer. The reason that the summer was miserable is because in April 1815 the volcano Mount Tambora had erupted, and threw so much ash into the atmosphere that 1816 was known as &quot;the year without a summer&quot; - it&apos;s like the nuclear winter of Cold War terror but with a natural origin and no radiation.I&apos;m not sure how much the science of the day understood about the cause of their miserable summer, but they certainly understood the effects it had on their farming and livestock..The ash in the upper atmosphere produced incredibly dramatic sunsets and sunrises, which we have records of in paintings. Shelley was clearly inspired by nature and the natural phenomena she saw, and the circumstances might have been of slightly more significance than just leading her to stay inside a lot that year: the famine caused by the weather was proof of man&apos;s inability to defeat nature, and as a highly intelligent and thoughtful woman, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this was in the back of her mind when writing Frankenstein.The wikipedia article about this is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer  and it actually mentions Shelley and Frankenstein right down the bottom. I thought it was interesting, and it might help some people.;</string>
            <string>You&apos;re welcome :);</string>
            <string>I love the Refrigerated Women essay and I love where your thoughts are going with this too. I was thinking on similar lines - I&apos;m not disabled, but my mother is, and I have my own chronic conditions which sensitise me to the problems even further - but your ideas are much more fleshed out than mine are as yet. I hope you post your essay so&apos;s I can read it. :);It&apos;s an interesting point, I&apos;m not sure why you got scored down for that. I think The Country of the Blind was more of an investigation into the saying, and what would actually happen when you get a society which knows no sight, rather than the investigation Wyndham did in Day of the Triffids, which was much more about the falling apart of society and the specific horrors which could (perhaps would) be committed under those circumstances. Wyndham did similar investigations in The Kraken Wakes and The Chrysalids, just not with blindness as a starting premise.The temptation when one is in a position of power is to abuse it. Most of us keep our abuses to fairly low-grade things, but some people do terrible things because they can; what they do changes depending on the situation, but not the reason why. Nunez in Country of the Blind is clearly one of the former type rather than the latter. He is not a particularly violent man, he doesn&apos;t want to hurt the blind people, and once he realises that actually he&apos;s not in a position of power he knuckles down and gets on with things.  (Of course, there are some saintly people who never abuse their position of power, but it&apos;s a lot harder to do than most people realise. I&apos;ve seen people try. It requires scrupulous honesty and constant self-awareness.)So to answer your question: we live in both. We are capable of both amazing co-operation and selflessness, and horrific abuses of power and privilege. Our society is balanced between them very carefully. What would happen in a disaster such as Wells imagines in The Star, or Wyndham in his disaster trio, or Max Brooks in World War Z, is still up for debate.;All of the examples you gave there Sean are examples of military action, which is different than civilian situations. Not only that, they&apos;re examples of extreme racial prejudice in two of your cases: Kosovo and Nanking were as much about racial hatred as they were about control of the population, lending itself much more easily to abuses, and Vietnam had a huge amount of ideological propaganda behind it which also doesn&apos;t help with viewing other people as, well, real people.There aren&apos;t many modern examples of disaster situations where the local, national or international government hasn&apos;t stepped in pretty quickly, but it seems that in the first instance of disaster, most people don&apos;t immediately start looting, desecrating the dead, and raping each other. Not everyone commits acts of heroism or altruism either, but you get significant examples of it. It&apos;s the long-term aftermath where the constructs of society start to break down that&apos;s likely to lead to these situations of extreme abuses of power, and fortunately we don&apos;t have examples of those situations for a long time. The only historical examples I can think of are the withdrawal of the Roman legions from the north of Europe, the fall of the Minoan civilisation, and... er... that&apos;s all I&apos;ve got, my world history is crap, most civilisations fall from invasion rather than disaster. (The Roman withdrawal is really a debatable one too. It&apos;s not like it was overnight, but a lot was lost in Britain.) I think maybe the fall of the first line of Pharoahs in Egypt? There was a big gap there.My point is, there&apos;s a lot of evidence that military action lends itself well to abuses of power over civilians, but in a societal collapse, the military falls just as quickly as the rest of us do. Sometimes faster. Fragments will remain, most militaries are better placed to retain structure and discipline, but it really would depend on the type of disaster. Zombies? They&apos;re the first in line. Plague? Just as liable to catch it. Nuclear holocaust? Better prepared by far.I read Wyndham as a teenager. Thinking about it, that might not have been my father&apos;s super-best recommendation.Also, re: The Kraken Wakes - it has a really good and subtle discussion about mental illness, specifically depression and PTSD, at a time when that couldn&apos;t be talked about much. It is very tiffin and tea though. I like that phrase a lot :D And I like tiffin and tea. Mmm. Tiffin and tea. I should have some.;</string>
            <string>There&apos;s a very interesting book by Joseph Conrad called &apos;The Hero with Thousand Faces&apos; in which he examines different themes and archetypes that seem to reoccur in folk tales from various different cultures, including aboriginal Australians. The hero he talks about is one that he refers to as Promethean, someone who, like Prometheus goes outside of the usual security of his own society in order to bring them back some great gift, and who, in doing so, sacrifices himself for the common good. He also looks at other things such as tricksters that see to be fairly ubiquitous, the aboriginal one taking the form of a crow.  I also remember seeing some footage once of Pete Seeger discussing how the same tunes are sometimes found in the folk music of different cultures. Songs can be played using different scales or modes, depending on where in the world they&apos;re being played and still sound the same in the same way that stories can be told in one part of the world in one way and in another part of the world in another way and still remain fundamentally the same.One of the things I love about literature is the way in which stories can pass so easily across boundaries of all kinds. People who might otherwise seem to be very different respond to the stories in the same way. In this way they can express both the ways in which we are all very different and yet at the same time all the same, &apos;all men are alike (tho&apos; infinitely various)&apos;.;</string>
            <string>I would like to share with all of you an interesting BBC program about The Grimm Brothers.  Melvyn Bragg&apos;s In Our Time is awesome, fantastic.Here is the link:http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00h8t18Oscar;</string>
            <string>Wow, thanks!;I enjoyed the back story analysis because I have had to study a lot of Freudian theory (though I am not a clinical psychologist or a therapist) and I consider it valid as a tool of interpretation. I had not seen it applied like this to a fairy tale, so it was interesting in that sense. The professor did clarify at the beginning he was just &quot;suggesting&quot; this interpretation and it enriches my learning to hear of it, even as I understand that there are many other interpretations.     I think that a back story serves to contextualize the collective psychological underpinnings of a story and we don&apos;t have to accept every back story as the absolute truth.   Just consider them as a possible part of the historical and cultural context. ;</string>
            <string>Interesting point! When we first see him in the novel, it doesn&apos;t appear that he feels out of place at all. He is wearing clothing, although rabbits in the real world do not; he is muttering to himself, lamenting the fact that he will be late even though rabbits in the real world do not speak or (I imagine) have any sort of sense of time. Also, I want to know what he was doing in our world in the first place. Buying new clothes? Getting his pocket watch wound? There are so many questions now!;I wanted to see what other people thought about the idea that Alice is mad. She doesn&apos;t understand or conform to the logic of that world, which is a kind of madness. The following is what I wrote for my essay   to give me a bit of back-up for this silly idea. Let me know what you think!Lewis Caroll is the author of whimsical, imaginative, and incredible tales.  Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland  is a tale of a world gone mad. While Alice is quite rational in the real world, I argue that she is quite mad in the context of Wonderland.Within the novel, Alice seems to be confused about what and who she is. When she encounters the mother pigeon in the woods, she tries to explain what she is. She sputters, &quot;&apos;But I&apos;m NOT a serpent, I tell you! [...] I-I&apos;m a little girl,&apos; said Alice, rather doubtfully&quot;. (Caroll, Location 385) Almost every encounter she has makes her question her beliefs in the order of the world. By the time she reaches the Caterpillar, she can only tell him, &quot;&apos;I-I hardly know [who I am], sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then&apos;&quot;. (Caroll, Location 320)The Cheshire Cat is the one who really points out what kind of fantastic and nonsensical place Wonderland is. When they meet, the Cheshire Cat says, &quot;&apos;We&apos;re all mad here. I&apos;m mad. You&apos;re mad. [...] You must be,&apos; said the Cat, &apos;or you wouldn&apos;t have come here&apos;&quot;. (Caroll, Location 480)It is quite obvious that she is unable to understand even the simplest things, such as words, in Wonderland. When she asks the Mouse to tell his story, he says &quot;&apos;Mine is a long and sad tale!&apos; said the Mouse [...] &apos;It IS a long tail, certainly,&apos; said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse&apos;s tail; &apos;but why do you call it sad?&apos;&quot;. (Caroll, Location 200)Alice enters Wonderland with a fixed sense of the order of the world. Her core beliefs are challenged at every turn, and she questions who she is throughout the entire piece. Wonderland is ruled by nonsense, and her normal bahavior does not fit in, causing her to become mad within that environment.;Alice never questions what her name is, but she is constantly questioning who she is throughout the novel. As she makes her journey, she encounters many rude and curious creatures and situations. Although she is in a world of nonsense, she reacts to many things with logic and rationality--which, in Wonderland, is actually madness because everything is topsy-turvy.;</string>

            <string>After Frankenstein destroys the bride of his monster before she is completed, his enemy proclaims, &quot;Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict&quot;. Frankenstein responds immediately after by saying, &quot;Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice&quot;. These two sentences sandwiched together really resonated with Christian parallels. I agree in that Frankenstein is trying to portray his creation as a devil, or indeed as The Devil; Frankenstein&apos;s creation feels himself to be at odds with all of mankind, and seeks to punish them for their callousness.;</string>

            <string>I really like Bradbury&apos;s style of writing. I think my favorite book of his is  Something Wicked This Way Comes. That book haunted my thoughts for weeks.;</string>
            <string>Stephanie,This entering the public sphere (and taking on an active, aggressive, relatively powerful role) out of necessity and then withdrawing to the private sphere reminds me of Bradamant and Britomart (female knights in Renaissance works: Orlando Furioso and The Faerie Queene). Interestingly, they both carry enchanted spears enabling them to defeat all foes....except Britomart&apos;s enchanted spear does not work with the man destined to be her husband.;It is my understanding that Stoker never traveled to the &quot;far-flung&quot; places he describes. He consulted books...;In chapter one, Jonathan Harker writes the following about Transylvania (Romania): &quot;The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East...&quot; &quot;...The district he named...is in the midst of one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe...&quot;&quot;I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some imaginative whirlpool...&quot;These observations are ironic given that Stoker never visited this part of Europe...and that he imagines the Romanians exercise their imaginations and embrace untrue ideas about the world...isn&apos;t that exactly what Harker and Stoker are doing? I wonder...is this just an example of Orientalism or also satire of it?;</string>
            <string>I was caused to think about Stoker&apos;s view of women a number of times throughout the story. I definitely sensed that in many instances he used the book as a way bash the New Woman movement, and near the end of the book it felt a little too forced how all of the men were going leaps and bounds to try to protect Mina from any kind of discomfort, even mild mental discomfort from the discussions of their daily vampire hunts.At the same time though, I think Stoker did do a good job in general of showing how men and women can compliment each other. The men were focused and determined, but Mina also reminded them of the truth that nobody else thought about--that Dracula too was a victim, that at one point he was a person turned sour like Lucy was. Mina also brought a different perspective to the notes and journals that they had was able to help them track down Dracula.While at times the characters in the book sometimes seemed a little harsh towards women&apos;s abilities in general, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily extrapolate this to Stoker&apos;s view of women in general. Stepping out of our cultural understanding for a moment and thinking about the culture in the book, this was considered normal. Something that has frustrated me about many pieces of historical fiction is the number of women who act outside of the societal norms for the time. It&apos;s just not very believable.;I absolutely loved this book. I was not overly thrilled at first to see that it was in the form diaries and letters, but I came to enjoy this style of writing as it made me feel more a part of the book and the characters.I do agree that for all their carefulness, there were a few times when the party was strangely ignorant, such as the bat and Mina&apos;s condition. The bat maybe I could see as them not taking notice, especially if they have no reason to believe that Dracula knows they&apos;re searching for him. I feel like Mina&apos;s condition should have been a little more obvious to them, especially so shortly after the ordeal with Lucy. Again, maybe I could let it slide that the possibility of Dracula&apos;s knowing and coming after them didn&apos;t cross their minds, but it was still kind of silly for them.Other than that though, I didn&apos;t really have any problems with the book. I really enjoyed the way it started too, focusing on Jonathan&apos;s journal while at Castle Dracula and then leaving you off to wonder if he died out there or made it out somewhere.;While I agree there&apos;s a lot of symbolism and parodies in Carroll&apos;s books... it could be he picked it just because. Not everything has to have a second meaning or secret implication.And I&apos;ve never had any kind of marmalade...;As I understood it, Maria is right about when Dracula can change. After sunset and before sunrise, he can do whatever he wants in regard to his form. As for a limitation, I don&apos;t think Van Helsing ever said that Dracula  had  to sleep in his coffin during the day, but stated that if he was out after sunrise he would be unable to change form until night. So at Piccadilly, that means he would have been in his human form.I imagine that the reason he was attacking them was because he returned to Carafax to sleep, but found that his coffins had been sterilized, and so was now hurrying to his other coffin locations in spite of the daylight to make sure they were safe, rather than sleeping as he had planned.;</string>
            <string>I believe it was because he was asleep. I don&apos;t know if there are any limitations on how long he can/has to sleep. Though I suppose that since he can&apos;t be killed by getting hit with a shovel, he probably wasn&apos;t too concerned about it.;</string>
            <string>My essay was actually, to some degree, about that very sentence. In my opinion, it establishes the setting for fairy tales at a place outside of time. &quot;Once upon a time&quot; does not simply mean that it happened &quot;a hundred years ago&quot; or &quot;a long time ago&quot; but rather at a place where time is meaningless, when magic was real and where frogs could turn into princes and the heads of dead horses could talk and no one would remark on it as being odd or unexpected.;If you click on Peer Responses from the left-side menu and scroll down to this week&apos;s assignment, it will say that it is due &quot;1 day, 1 hour&quot; from now, which is true no matter where you are in the world.;</string>

            <string>It seems fairly obvious. In addition to all the transfusions and &quot;marriage&quot; sexual references (&quot;No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves&quot;), one that I found particularly revealing, even if more subtly stated, was Mina&apos;s description of the first time Lucy is attacked in her sleep, noting that  &quot;on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood.&quot;;</string>

            <string>Nice! I am well inspired by your thought. Perhaps not only time is meaningless, but also space is meaningless. In sum, the story in a fairy tale happens in a unreal world, a fantasy world, which only exists in our mind. &quot;once upon a time&quot; actually omits the possiblity of readers questioning the reality of the story, thus gives the writer absolute power to create and let the mind flow freely without limitation, creating a world where anything can happen. This is unlike the writing for history, where anything, any time, any space, any event should be taken into serious consideration and verification. However, there are some limits for fairy tales, as it is a work of writing, and a work of writing must obey the rule of &quot;purpose-and-audience&quot;.;</string>

            <string>There&apos;s no evidence that he ever molested or abused little girls. He was an early adopter of photography and took thousands of photos of children, especially girls. He also took nude studies of several of them, usually with a chaperon present (though in at least one case, involving the three Mayhew girls, he requested to take the pictures without anyone there, and the family told him he couldn&apos;t). He also got flak for kissing one of the girls that he hung out with, and in 1995, one of his biographers published a few of the nudes that Carroll took... at least one does look decidedly creepy. Most of his pictures, though, are fairly sweet and innocent. He may have had dark thoughts about his friends, but it doesn&apos;t appear that he ever acted on them.;</string>
            <string>For what it&apos;s worth, a contemporary of Lewis Carroll published what he claimed (joking, of course) was the &apos;original&apos; version of Jabberwocky, in German.Der Jammerwoch Robert Scott  Es brillig war. Die schlichte Toven Wirrten und wimmelten in Waben; Und aller-m _msige Burggoven Die mohmen R _th&apos; ausgraben.     Bewahre doch vor Jammerwoch! Die Z _hne knirschen, Krallen kratzen!

Die schlichte Toven Wirrten und wimmelten in Waben; Und aller-m _msige Burggoven Die mohmen R _th&apos; ausgraben.;I&apos;m a USAnian, and I&apos;m writing my essay about how my first experiences with British English, or at least the first time I discovered that British English wasn&apos;t necessarily American English, was with the Alice books when I was 7 and 8 years old. Things like marmalade, fenders, chimneypieces, treacle, plum pudding, snapdragons, and other such Britishisms (or distinctly English things) were all conundrums in and of themselves. To this day, whenever I read those words in other Victorian fiction, I picture a Sir John Tenniel woodcut illustrating it... makes my readings of Dickens and Trollope that much more interesting.;</string>
            <string>I thought the same thing about &quot;The Golden Bird,&quot; except the version I grew up with was a French-Canadian tale called &quot;The Golden Phoenix,&quot; specifically in a version by Marius Barbeau. I&apos;ve heard the Firebird story as well. Honestly, I think I like either of those versions better than &quot;The Golden Bird.&quot;;Several times in the book, Van Helsing makes the comment that Dracula&apos;s best disguise is that no one in England believes in Vampires, and it&apos;s implied all throughout the book. Even once they&apos;re able to accept it on the surface, they&apos;re not thinking like people used to the supernatural when Mina is being attacked. Also, I&apos;ve noticed that the sexism toward Mina, after she put everything together and indeed, went on their earlier expeditions with them, is so over-the-top (unlike how it&apos;s depicted in the rest of the novel) that I think the author was making the point that their very urge to protect and shield her and keep her in the dark was exactly what put her in danger. It&apos;s not the usual take that I find in Victorian novels, and I found it refreshing.;I wrote my essay about how the vampire hunters made a big deal about how they had to leave Mina behind in order to protect her. That bit in Chapter XVIII drips with sexism, even moreso than the other parts of the book, and I really felt like Mr Stoker was pointing out that that kind of protective prejudice was in fact dangerous. Also, Mr Stoker&apos;s mother was a leading social leader and a fighter for a woman&apos;s right to vote, so such issues were always at the forefront of his world. ;I don&apos;t really care for the TV series True Blood, but I am a solid fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I often describe them as &quot;Twilight for Grownups.&quot; It&apos;s quite obvious that Ms Harris doesn&apos;t take herself too seriously and is having a blast writing them. Also, she does a good job of writing lighthearted mysteries that can still jump out and spook you once in a while.;You can&apos;t legally get free copies online, but most libraries will have at least the first few (Dead Until Dark, Living Dead in Dallas, Club Dead). Each season follows at least the central plot of each book, though they&apos;ve made a bunch of changes, such as introducing and then killing minor characters, rather than killing off the major characters who die in the books. They&apos;re by Charlaine Harris, and I&apos;d say they&apos;re equal parts dark comic mystery and gothic romance. ;I think Bram Stoker is using irony here. The cultured, scientific &apos;Western Man&apos; is convinced of his superiority over the backward East Europeans, yet it is that very sense of superiority which lands him in trouble. Later, Van Helsing mentions that Dracula&apos;s best protection is that people in the West don&apos;t believe in such things as nosferatu. It&apos;s much like the famous line in The Usual Suspects... &quot;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&apos;t exist.&quot;;</string>
            <string>While there&apos;s  no evidence of abuse, his obsession with kissing his child-friends (seen his letters) and some of his nude  photographs are--as you say--creepy by today&apos;s standards.   But I argue in my thread (I didn&apos;t see this one first) that even by the standards of his time the definition of childhood was complex, and his behavior even more so.I include quotes from his letters in my thread as well.https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=425#comment-2796;While Carroll&apos;s journals don&apos;t make many references to sex, his letters to little girls raise eyebrows.   He makes endless references to how much he wants to kiss the little girls, playfully  enumerating how many kisses he wants to give them.   That--combined with his statements about his love of the nudity of little girls--makes me question his intentions.   And though the book  doesn&apos;t contain many overt sexual references,   it makes many memorable references to food, which as Professor Rabkin has suggested, can sometimes be a stand-in for love, or sex.I&apos;ll admit that even after spending a year studying Carroll for my thesis, I&apos;m still not comfortable coming to definitive conclusion about his desires--but I do wonder.;The standards of the day were complex.   In Victorian England, the age of consent was 12 until 1875, when it was raised to 13.   So while children  were treated as cherubs, they were also sexualized.And Dodgson  didn&apos;t like the nudity of all children.   He only liked the nudity of little girls.   In one letter her wrote: &quot;I confess I do not admire naked boys.   They always seem to me to need clothes   whereas one hardly sees why the lovely forms of girls should ever be covered up.&quot;In another letter he was playful about requesting the nudity of his child-friends.   To a mother he wrote:&quot;At any rate, I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked; at her age, it seems almost absurd to even suggest any scruple about dress.My great hope, I confess, is about Ethel   _Do consider her case in reference to the fact that she herself is quite indifferent about dress.  If worst comes to worst, and you won   t concede to any nudities at all, I think you ought to allow all three to be done in bathing-drawers, to make up for my disappointment!P.S  _.what I like best of all is to have two hours of leisure-time before me, one child to photograph, and no restrictions as to costume! (It is a descending Arithmetical Series   2, 1, 0.).&quot;The nude poses he chose for his child-friends were not all cherubic.   One in particular one stands out of the nude  eight year old Evelyn Hatch  reclining in an  odalisque pose.   I will not post it here, but is found in the source I credit below.And though he wrote to many mothers asking for permission to photograph their daughters and also kiss them, he also  recognized that they might be shocked at the suggestion:&quot;Also, are they kissable? I hope you won   t be shocked at the question, but nearly all my girl-friends (of all ages, and even married ones!) are now on those terms with me (who am now sixty four).   With girls under fourteen, I don   t think it necessary to ask the question: But I guess Margery to be over fourteen, and, in such cases, with new  friends, I usually ask the mother   s leave.&quot;There was a duality to the concept  of childhood at the time, which makes understanding Dodgson&apos;s motives all the more complicated.Source on Consent Age:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046Source for Quote 1:  Gernsheim, Helmut.

            <string>I agree with you mostly, especially on the &quot;moot point&quot; charge. It really doesn&apos;t matter anymore and it&apos;s unlikely we will ever know anyway,  That said, can we please agree that &quot;at that time it was ok&quot; excuses are never valid. Regardless of how the society of the time felt about it, a lot of them also thought that being left-handed was a sign of the devil and beat their children for it. It was still wrong - we know better.  ;From what I read, and my take after reading the book, Alice&apos;s Adventure in Wonderland is largely a story about growing up, and the struggle to retain and define an adult identity in a confusing and frequently nonsensical kind of world.  Throughout the story Alice changes size repeatedly, early on she has no choice but to do so (to get through the door), and later (in the rabbit&apos;s house) she drinks the bottle and changes size just &quot;because something interesting is bound to happen&quot;, but these early changes tend to go awry and have discomfiting effects on her. Later though, after meeting the Caterpillar, she is finally able to return to her &quot;proper&quot; size, whereat she is most comfortable. Almost immediately afterwards, however, she uses the mushroom to adjust her size to match the March Hare&apos;s house, showing that she has gained some control over her changes, and is comfortable enough with herself to make those changes to accommodate others. It&apos;s a massive step forward for the little girl who cried so hard when she couldn&apos;t reach the key to get through the door.At the same time as these physical and psychological changes are occurring for Alice she goes through a number of different thought processes, such as her poignant question &quot;but if I&apos;ve changed, then who am I?&quot; There are many quotations of this kind that follow Alice&apos;s development from scared and confused to confident and self-assured, though I haven&apos;t my notes with me to include them (all quotes above are also paraphrases, sorry).  ;It&apos;s probably not the greatest thing for you to take a no-compromise stance on, considering the easy availability of online dictionaries that could give you the word &quot;unintelligible&quot;.  ;I&apos;m glad someone else has raised this issue, because I felt a little uncomfortable broaching it. Of the 5 essays I marked, four of them were almost unreadable, the grammar and spelling was so bad. One of them was clearly a non-native speaker, for whom I had far more sympathy, and I did my best to evaluate all of them fairly, reserving comments on grammar and tone for the form section.  My concern is this: I&apos;m a native speaker, with a BA in English, but live outside the US (and in fact in a non-English-speaking country). Is my location affecting the peers assignments I&apos;m given? I could understand structuring a course so that people from similar geographic or demographic areas are lumped together, but if that is what&apos;s happening I&apos;m going to be an outlier for my region.  ;Alice is trying to determine who she is, and trying to find a way to return to her &quot;proper size&quot;, i.e a sense of self with which she is comfortable, in the face of all the demands Wonderland has of her to be another. Alice is still wary of changing, and tries to explain this to the caterpillar by suggesting that he will feel it queer when he changes into a chrysalis and then a butterfly.  The caterpillar rejects this and, what&apos;s more, doesn&apos;t see a need for him to explain who he is:  &quot;`I think, you ought to tell me who  YOU  are, first.&apos;  `Why?&apos; said the Caterpillar.&quot;  Unlike Alice struggling to find her identity (proper size), the caterpillar embraces change, and rejects the need to explain or define himself for others. Finally, he gives Alice the tools necessary for her to change her size at will, which allows her at first to return to her &quot;proper size&quot;, but then later to adjust her size according to the situation she finds herself in.;I think all literary works, in order to be successful, have to abide by their own set of internal laws. Even the most rigorous of realist fiction cannot follow precisely an exact replica of &quot;the laws of our physical universe&quot;. In that regard he most certainly adheres to a very rigorous set of aesthetic laws which define the relationship between the writer and his audience.  Though things may happen to Alice seemingly at random, and the laws of physics twist and alter according to strange dream logic, yet Carroll is not free suddenly to change tack and start writing a murder-mystery novel. If you are asking whether he devised laws specifically to replace the conventional laws of physics (i.e if you cry a lot your tears will create a great lake of salty water) I would probably have to say no, but that&apos;s not to say hat the story doesn&apos;t progress along a logical (and indeed lawful) path, howsoever twisted that logic may be.  ;I agree with Cheri, the books are far too psychological, too internal, to translate easily into movies. I don&apos;t see why it shouldn&apos;t be possible to translate them into a different language though. Perhaps different languages might fare differently due to their inherent differences - I could see German working well, for instance, whereas those with entirely different structures or cultural backgrounds might interpret differently. As for the translations Anahita has read, well, maybe they&apos;re just bad translations.  ;You seem rather upset by this, and quite sure that your many quotations should have earned you &quot;at least a 5&quot;, so let&apos;s take a closer look.  Overall, I agree with Peer 4. Your approach is certainly a worthwhile one, comparing the texts with some possible historical influences, but I&apos;m afraid some grammar errors, odd sentence constructions, and opaque rather than concise writing makes your essay rather confusing.  In paragraph one, for example, in which you lay out your thesis, you make three statements:1.  The tale of  The Frog Prince  illustrates life during an age when class divisions were clearly defined. 2. The opening line    In the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted    alludes to an innocent, heroic time in the past when status barriers were not so important. 3. Moreover, plot elements derived from mythology and the biblical account of David are incorporated to sustain the value of hope, as well as the elusive promise of deliverance.The first two statements are contradictory, and the third unrelated to them. Your use of the word &quot;moreover&quot; suggests to the casual reader that the following sentence will provide more evidence for the argument presented previously, but that is not the case.Para 2: &quot;Reminiscent  of&quot;, if you please.  Para 3: &quot;However, distain is not so easily overcome.&quot; I assume you meant &quot;disdain&quot;, but even granting you that this sentence is neither supported by additional arguments, nor does it introduce or relate to the remainder of the paragraph. Also, I don&apos;t think you know what disdain means.  At the end of this paragraph you draw a comparison between the Princess and Odysseus&apos;s wife, Penelope. In the Odyssey, Penelope is alone at home, her husband presumed dead, while dozens of suitors invade her home, drinking her food, and trying to persuade her to marry them. She holds off the suitors by with constant delays until eventually her husband returns home to slaughter them. If this were parallel with the frog prince story Odysseus would return home only to be rejected by Penelope and cast away. Perhaps you could have compared the Frog Prince to Agamemnon, for whom that was exactly what happened.This inaccurate comparison continues through paragraph 4. Without better supporting evidence this comparison falls apart. It survived only so far as it did because you misrepresent at least one myth with which your peers were not familiar.  As for your conclusion, faithful servant characters occur in basically every body of literature, from Lord of the Rings to the Iliad, as well as a dozen Grimm tales. Pointing out that they reoccur here is no great insight, I&apos;m afraid. Given all of this, your last sentence, &quot;It&apos;s possible to conclude then, that attitudes concerning designated sub-classes were revealing, and in hoping to overcome them, was oftentimes met with hostility, violence and grief&quot;, is really hard to justify. It&apos;s also really hard to read.I&apos;m sorry if all this seems harsh. It&apos;s because of the awful noise my irony meter has been making ever since I read the lines: &quot;P.S. I&apos;m sure it didn&apos;t enrich your reading - you have to actually read something for that to happen.&quot;, and &quot;it&apos;s the sheer arrogance that annoys me&quot;;I like your central idea here, that in the Grimm tales objects and comparisons can serve as an indication of growth, though it could certainly have been carried far deeper. Did you consider contrasting this idea with Lucky Hans, who slowly loses all his possessions?;I&apos;m a little hesitant to post my assignment as I was a little late catching on to the rhythm of this course and suddenly realized at work that I had only 12 hours to turn something in. As a result the writing is rather poor and I was fairly horrified to find when I got it back that there were grammar errors. Nevertheless, I have commented on others essays here, and in the spirit of fair play I feel it only appropriate to allow them the same opportunity.My grade was 4 which, under the circumstances, is probably appropriate.  Words That BindInvocatory rhymes in the Brothers Grimm   s tales reveal the special power that spoken words have to transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel the listener within and without the oral tradition of folk Germany.  The repetitive use of short, incantatory passages, such as,        &quot;Flounder, Flounder in the sea,              Hither, quickly come to me,              For my wife, dame Isabel,                Wishes what I scarce dare tell&quot; (The Fisherman and His Wife)performs the same mnemonic function as repetitive phrases in other works from oral tradition, such as &quot;Dawn with her rosy fingers&quot; (The Iliad), in that they are easy to remember, and provide a touchstone from which an oral story-teller can build. In the Brothers Grimm&apos;s tales they  also serve to bookmark and separate the story&apos;s different stages. The rhyming couplets given above are, in The Fisherman and His Wife, repeated six times, and every instance marks the beginning of a distinct stage in the story with a new set of demands, a new house for his wife,  and an increasingly [ed: grammar error repaired] agitated sea.Yet more than that, it seems to transcend the boundary between the worlds of the flounder and the fisherman, and to compel the flounder to appear before him and hear his wish. Boundaries are similarly transgressed in Rapunzel (&quot;Rapunzel! Rapunzel!/Let down your hair!&quot;), allowing the Prince (or the witch) entry into Rapunzel&apos;s tower sanctuary, and in &quot;The Almond Tree&quot;, where the bird transcends death with his song to bring about the gory conclusion.In all instances these words seem to have a special power, both within the fantasy world of the tale and without. It is these phrases, after all, that best survive down through the centuries. Perhaps we, as readers, are comfortable granting these words such power within their own stories precisely because we recognize the very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without.Form Responses:peer 1      In general, this essay has good form. I would have just a couple minor quibbles. First, &quot;an increasibly agitated sea.&quot; Do you mean &quot;increasingly&quot;? Second, &quot;Yet more than that, it seems to transcend  _&quot; What is the &quot;it&quot; here? The repetitive use of invocatory phrases? You could make that a bit clearer to your reader.peer 2      Very good use of sentence structure, grammar, spelling and vocabulary. I particularly like the very direct and matter-of-fact style of writing you have adopted. Some of the longer sentences jarred slightly though, so it might be helpful to break them down into smaller sentences to make it easier on the reader.peer 3      The structure of this essay is clear and the use of a quotation from one of the tales gives to it a more appealing appearance and also adds to the essay rhythm. But even though the structure really helps to understand the message I think that the essay mixes two different ideas along the text: the repetition as a way to help the reader to follow the story and also the &quot;special&quot; power that those repetitions seem to have in the stories. I think that both of those interpretations of the repetitions would have been enough to build a whole essay on them. On the other hand if you wanted to put both of them in the same essay I think it would have been better and clearer to give to both of them the same presence in the text.Content Responses:peer 1      I most appreciate your attention to the idea that these passages &quot;transcend boundaries.&quot; You could have perhaps limited yourself to just that point, and thereby had space to more thoroughly develop your three examples (flounder, Rapunzel, and Almond Tree). Given your opening sentence, I would have expected your essay to develop evidence that these passages transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel listeners (within and without the tale). I&apos;m not sure how much your paragraph that includes reference to the Iliad -- in which you point to the bookmarking and memorability of these passages -- contributes to your overall argument. I would have liked to see more development of your point about how the passages compel the listener outside the narrative of the story itself.peer 2      I very much like the way you&apos;ve gone with this essay - I think focusing on the language used, rather than the symbology, was a very unique perspective and an interesting direction to take. You have presented the importance of the repetitions very persuasively. I am a little confused with the last sentence however; very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without. It would have been nice had you explained this a little further, perhaps given an example of how words such as this one have transcended boundaries outside of the stories themselves.peer 3      I really enjoyed your essay and the ideas you present in it. They way you created a relation between certain repetitions and how the stories move forward was really clear. Also the reference to the Illiad helps us remember that this narrative technique has been present since a really long time ago in many different works of art. But I think it would have been important to distinguish different uses of repetitions in the tales, for example, in one of the first tales in this collection, &quot;The Rabbit&apos;s Bride&quot;, we have a repetition at the begining of the tale but the action doesn&apos;t change until the third repetition of a certain passage, there were no changes in the action or the characters after the previous two repetitions. For me, what would have made your essay a perfect one would have been to introduce that difference between the uses of the repetitions and then go for one of them and analyze it in detail.;And yet comments you shall have.  I&apos;m sorry if you think the book is &quot;pure and utter madness&quot;, because that&apos;s simply not the case. Irrationality and disorder are certainly strong themes in the book, but Alice herself is a fairly reasonable character struggling to adapt to a world full of incomprehensible practices, opaque rituals, and inscrutable characters. If you can&apos;t find some relevance to life in that, then I suspect you&apos;re not looking deep (or thinking wide) enough.  The books are  stuffed  with symbolism and imagery. If you&apos;re still having difficulty seeing that then pick up a copy of the book with an introductory essay and see what others have written about it.  ;And yet the locals live in fear of Dracula&apos;s castle, and it is Van Helsing&apos;s book learning that brings the creature to light and arms them to defeat it, freeing them all from the threat of the supernatural.;</string>
            <string>What I learned from my research was that there was never any mention of wrong doing during Lewis&apos; lifetime, or thereafter, until a Freudian scholar read the Alice books, and decided that he &quot;must have been&quot; a pedophile. The interesting thing, one article pointed out, is that, instead of the misconduct notion superseding the earlier version of Lewis as a gentle, studious Oxford don, the two versions have co-existed to this day. Personally, I think that speaks to the unsubstantiated nature of the pedophile claim.;</string>
            <string>Why do you all imply that loving little girls is something bad?;;</string>
            <string>Yeah me too. Lovecraft for essay writing and Doctorow for one of my Facebook posts.;I agree it is unfair that someone gave you a 1 based solely on grammar mistakes, however, you seem very resistant to the idea that you may need to improve your grammar.  I am an ESL teacher and I have seen this attitude a lot.  You seem to dismiss these grammar mistakes by saying that they are not critical, but minor mistakes are actually a big problem when it comes to essay writing. Multiple mistakes, no matter how minor, add up and they interrupt the flow of the essay and put a burden on the reader.  There is another major problem regarding grammar mistakes that has to do with perception. Students seems to think that minor mistakes are not a big deal but these mistakes often lower the reader&apos;s perception of the author&apos;s intelligence (whether on a  conscious or subconscious level)  . This, of course, is extremely unfair and illogical (if anything, recognizing that you can communicate effectively in a second language should raise their perception of your intelligence), but it is a reality.  Again, I really don&apos;t think you should have received a 1 based on minor mistakes in grammar but I also think that one of the points of this course is to identify how we can improve our writing.;Students seem to think-----oh how ironic :);I feel the same way you did about Alice in Wonderland. I found it clever and there were parts that made me laugh out loud, however, it was a little unsettling and I also found it a bit tiring to read. I also don&apos;t enjoy dream sequences or things that are too surreal (with the exception of paintings). They really hit me on a weird visceral level. For example, there is a little known movie called &apos;The Forbidden Zone&apos; and it is exactly like someone recording a dream and it really freaked me out.;While I think Freud is interesting, and should be studied because he had such a profound effect on the field of psychology, I really am baffled by how many people cite his work as if it is still widely accepted in the scientific community. Most of Freud&apos;s ideas have been discredited, especially dream theory and penis envy, which seem to still be referenced a lot. There are so many interesting theories being studied right now in psychology and neuroscience and these ideas could easily be integrated into our essays. I just think analyzing a text based on Freudian theories is overdone. I don&apos;t think these Freudian theories add any level of deeper meaning to essays and I find them very tiresome and cliche.I don&apos;t want to make anyone angry and I am not trying to insult people who used Freud in their essays, because I am sure there were good essays that also referenced Freud. The professor spoke about Freud as well, so I am also assuming some people took their cues from his lectures. Again I am not trying to insult people. This is just my personal opinion. Are there others who feel this way as well, or am   I in the minority?  Also, don&apos;t worry I am not marking down papers because of my personal aversion to his ideas.  ;  I came across this article  http://boingboing.net/2007/10/15/neuroscience-of-alic.html   which has a link to an article  that described some possible neurological conditions exhibited by characters in Alice in Wonderland. It links some of these to afflictions suffered by Dodgson (like migraines and speech impediment). I suppose you could write an essay about the possibility that Dodgson&apos;s real life afflictions influenced influenced his writing, and also look at the implications of displaying and highlighting &apos;&apos;madness&apos;&apos; in Alice in Wonderland  in the context of  a society that basically locked away mentally ill people and kept them hidden away from the rest of society.  ;Your post is extremely aggressive. This type of post is actually the reason I don&apos;t think people should be able to post anonymously. I am not discrediting anyone&apos;s thoughts, I am simply stating that some of Freud&apos;s views are not accepted widely in modern Psychology. There has been a decline in psychoanalysis as well and its importance has waned in modern psychiatry. I believe this is because a lot of Freud&apos;s theories are not falsifiable which is a key component in the scientific method. I also understand that penis envy refers to children and not adults but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that it is generally not accepted anymore and it is misogynistic to the point of being absurd . I didn&apos;t say that everything Freud said was wrong. I acknowledged that he has had a very big influence. I also acknowledged that some people who cited Freud probably wrote interesting essays. All I said was that there are other sources out there that people can cite in addition to Freud. All in all it was a pretty innocuous statement that didn&apos;t warrant such an angry tirade.;The terminology isn&apos;t intimidating. I am just stating that penis envy isn&apos;t an accepted theory anymore. Sex is a huge factor in human behavior and it is a fascinating way in which to analyze readings. I am also an avid Dan Savage reader so i can pretty much handle any sex terminology you throw at me. Also, I studied anthropology/zoology as an undergrad, which involved a lot of genetics and human evolution courses, so I basically studied how sex drove us to become who we are. Actually if you are going to analyze readings and discuss theories on sexuality I imagine that there are a wealth of modern resources. Society has become more open so honestly more modern research may be more interesting/enlightening anyways. ;Agreed. I am living in Turkey at the moment and there are a lot of men and women who are uncomfortable talking about sex. I once made a mildly sexual joke in mixed company and instantly regretted it. Of course there are some people here that don&apos;t mind talking about sex but I have to be more cautious than if I were in some other places. ;</string>
            <string>That&apos;s fantastic! Congrats!;Hi Maria, Good point. There isn&apos;t a right or wrong way to analyze literature and that is why my annoyance with Freud hasn&apos;t been reflected in my grading. You categorize Freud as a philosopher rather than a scientist and I think that is an interesting and useful distinction because my bafflement was with using outdated scientific theories as if they were still accepted by the scientific community, but if you frame Freud as a philosopher then it makes it much more palatable.  Also, I do think essays using Freud can be interesting and enlightening but I wish the professor would mention other frameworks as well, as this might encourage students to be bit more diverse. I may have gotten a weirdly skewed batch but they were almost all Freudian theories, which is what prompted me to write this post.  ;Peter,   I am living in Turkey right now and when the riots broke out in Brazil I thought there were a lot of interesting similarities to the protests here. They developed th same way, with a harsh police crackdown being a catalyst for protesting other deeper issues. Also, the  majority of protesters were first time protesters, young and educated and not associated with a particular political party. There also seems to be some global references for protesting now, like wearing Guy Fawkes masks and the term &quot;occupy&quot; as in Occupy Wallstreet and Occupy Gezi.  I didn&apos;t realize protesters were talking about creating a new form of government in Brazil. That is really interesting. Keep us updated. ;Don&apos;t talk about the books influence on future works: Basically this just means you are analyzing those future works and not the book we were assigned. For example if I said Dracula influenced Nosferatu, I would be analyzing Nosferatu instead of Dracula and this would not enrich my reading of Dracula.  Make your thesis clear in the first paragraph: you should be able to sum up your thesis in one sentence. When you read over your essay you should look at your evidence and make sure it supports your thesis (and let your  reader know HOW the evidence supports your thesis).  Apologies I am on my iPad and my bold key doesn&apos;t work..... ;Efthymia,I wasn&apos;t intending to be harsh and I don&apos;t think my fellow posters were either. I think if people want to improve as writers they need to be able to hear criticism without getting defensive. This is a class that asks peers to evaluate each other and I think it is useful to see what my peers find consensus on. As for rules, well, I just ended a sentence with a preposition so they can be broken :) Of course, not everyone is going to agree with each other and some reviewers say things that are just plain ridiculous, however, if multiple people are giving similar feedback then it is probably feeding worth noting.  Also, the things that I posted were really frustrating to me, because the essays that had these problems had the potential to be really good. For example, I reviewed a couple of essays with many different ideas that were unrelated to each other, and each of these ideas was interesting, but the overall essay was lacking any focus. I also reviewed two essays that talked about Alice in Wonderland&apos;s influence on future works. These essays were also interesting but they didn&apos;t follow the assignment. For the most part, these were not bad writers, they were just people who needed some guidelines to rein them in, and that is why I think this thread is really useful.  ;</string>
            <string>Grimm essay:   Nobakov. Must be all the talk about sweet, beautiful girls (Grimm princesses in my case.);</string>

            <string>Hehe, this is so fun. I pasted a couple of different blog posts and got Kurt Vonnegut, James Joyce, Arthur Clarke and H.P. Lovecraft! :);</string>
            <string>Anthony -- I think that must be a coincidence. I live in a non-English-speaking country as well, but I received only one essay that was clearly written by a non-native English speaker. Two of the essays had impeccable grammar and spellings, while the remaining two may have been written by native/non-native English speakers with a reasonable grasp of the intricacies of the language (a degree of awkward phraseology and a few spelling errors, but overall understandable).;The Alice essays I&apos;ve reviewed so far have been disastrous. One was nearly entirely copy-pasted from an article on the internet -- it just so happened that I had stumbled across that article while researching the books! Another had so many grammatical and syntactical errors that it was nearly impossible to figure out the argument. And a third was only 150 words, with each sentence briefly mentioning a new idea (the only piece below the recommended word range up till now).I have tried to be as generous with the marking as possible and have given extensive feedback and suggestions. For the plagiarised essay, however, I just couldn&apos;t bring myself to score higher than a 1 on both form and content.;</string>
            <string>Fantastic essay! I really enjoyed it and think you achieved the perfect balance between a close textual reading and a well-developed personal analysis.;I&apos;m not usually a fan of epistolary novels or vampires. Which is why I was so surprised to find myself thoroughly loving Dracula! The plot is engaging and the characters are well-developed. I also found it a pretty racy read (for some reason, I was expecting a dull, plodding narrative). Yes, there were a couple of obvious plot holes (how could the party be so silly as to not realise what was happening to Mina, for instance), but these didn&apos;t really impact my reading experience.  After completing the book, I found myself inspired enough to give True Blood a shot -- and I&apos;m loving it so far! One of the reasons I&apos;m doing this course is to discover new things, and this unit has helped me do exactly that. :) ;Hi Christopher! Thanks for the recommendation -- I&apos;m going to try and get my hands on the first few books. (Also, did you try watching a few episodes of True Blood? I think the show really hits its stride about midway through Season 1. Although if you read the books first, I can totally understand not being a fan of the show! Even with Game of Thrones, which is an excellent and fairly accurate TV adaptation, I much prefer the novels.);I&apos;ve been really lucky with my randomly assigned peer reviewers so far. Overall, the comments (both positive and negative) have been insightful and specific. A big thank-you to folks who are putting in the time and effort to carefully read the essays and provide thoughtful feedback!;</string>
            <string>Finally received the elusive 6! Rather unexpected, totally made my day :) The concept of    foreign-ness    and related anxieties play a critical role in Dracula.    Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,    says Dracula to Harker, underscoring his un-English ways. Transylvania is ruled tyrannically, is rife with superstitions, and breeds ancient horrors     in contrast to democratic, rationalist, modern England. Stoker, however, presents no easy dichotomy between the foreign and native. Transylvania   s superstitions are, after all, grounded in reality     one that the English (and the American) are ill-equipped to deal with due to the limitations of their narrow worldview. Harker, for instance, approaches Transylvania with an almost-colonial mindset, researching    books and maps    at the British Museum prior to his trip and deeming the warnings of local inhabitants    very ridiculous   . Dracula embodies the English fear of the powerful and unfamiliar    other   . He belongs to a    conquering race    whose spirit    would not brook that  _[they] were not free   . He has also appropriated all the tools necssary to masquerade as an Englishman: he is prodigiously well-read and familiar with the land   s language and laws. Thus, he is now dangerous to the English way of life. (Transylvanians who are viewed in a kindlier light are invariably powerless peasants.) This concern, however, is validated: not only does Dracula prey on his own subjects, but he also infiltrates    mighty London    to widen his hunting ground. In the end, Van Helsing     the benign foreigner who brings together the best of the scientific and the mystic     is &quot;the man to unmask...[Dracula] and hunt him out   . Van Helsing (like Stoker) has the advantage of an insider-outsider perspective: he is open to alternative truths (from legends about bats in the Pampas to the resurrection of Indian fakirs), but solidly anchored in the Western, Christian landscape. Dracula simultaneously holds the potential for both a critique of English assumptions about the foreign as well as an affirmation of the ultimate superiority of English moral values. ;Hey! I was one of your peer reviewers. Nice to know who wrote that great essay :) ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Of the five essays I graded for Unit 5 (Poe and Hawthorne), I wanted to give a 6 to four! One essay was almost entirely plagiarised, but the others were wonderful -- well-written, well-argued and demonstrating a close reading and deep understanding of the texts.So, did I just get lucky or are we all becoming better writers? Or is this due to the fact that the less interested/dedicated students have started dropping out?;</string>
            <string>for the first try i wrote like Oscar Wilde, and for the second try like Nabokov...it&apos;s funny because i never read them before;Not I&apos;m not buying the arguments of Sigmund Freud... Not all it&apos;s an &quot;death wish&quot; (German:todeswunsch) and desire to kill the father to take his place.;</string>
            <string>That&apos;s so funny for me too...it says that I write like H. P. Lovecraft, who indeed is one of my favourite writers.Thanks for the link, very interesting :);I have read in this thread (https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=183) that you only need to write a minimum of six essays. I hope it helps.;I felt completely identified with you, I have been totally frozen in front of the screen for many days...this text was tough, but breaking the ice was worst, so maybe the next ones will be easier for all :);</string>
            <string>I have entered my text in Russian and gave me the result of Charles Dickens;</string>
            <string>Perhaps the stories give abrupt plot twists to engage the listener with the storyteller.   In the Movie &quot;Princess Bride&quot; the grandfather (reader) will say something outrageous such as &quot;Buttercup married Prince Humperdinck.&quot;   The kid protests shrieking that it&apos;s not how the story is supposed to go.   These abrupt plot twists, even in the wrong direction, start a dialogue, teaching little ones to guess where a story &quot;should&quot; go, and to maybe teach that real life is not like that.   My son called this attempt to take a story where it shouldn&apos;t go &quot;goof reading.&quot;   My husband and son would love the goof-reading plots, even though as a child, he was like the boy in the Princess Bride - &quot;No that&apos;s not how it&apos;s supposed to go.&quot;;</string>
            <string>Ive also always thought this. I kind of equate a lot of these almost to a more subtle version of Aesops Tales, but sometimes things happen in the plot that are completely unpredicted and an event is triggered almost at random. I did my essay this week about the Grimms&apos; brothers use of three and repeating warnings which seems pretty common, but I also frequently asking myself &quot;where did that come from?&quot; in absence of their use of repitition.;</string>
            <string>I feel like too that Anderson&apos;s stories are more about the story than the moral, if that makes sense. Grimm&apos;s tales can mostly be traced back to basic moral roots, whereas I feel like Anderson&apos;s are, as Melissa said, more literary. While Anderson&apos;s stories do have a moral tale, they aren&apos;t broad or far reaching. They&apos;re more... I don&apos;t know, contained? Personal? Something like that. Smaller somehow. And so much bleaker.  ;</string>

            <string>Yes, I find   working with the Kindle quite frustrating for this kind of situation. A book is much superior for   flicking back and forth to revisit particular passages, plus this particular edition of Household Tales does not allow for going straight to one particular story unless one remembers to take a note of the location. One has not been taking note. ;)I have managed this assignment but I suspect that time for doing the actual reading is going to become a problem as the course progresses. In your case, before you throw in the towel completely, could you consider due to the short word length of the essay, that it is not really possible to delve into every story in Grimm&apos;s, so maybe you could still have a go by picking one story and really examining it. You still have time. The essay is short.I am going to have a problem when we come to Dracula as I do not read vampire stories, no exceptions, so I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do about that.;Thank you, Anonymous 1. And thank you also, Anonymous 2 for trying to tempt me into watching Dracula. I shall not be moved.  Florencia, I don&apos;t really know why I can&apos;t watch or read vampires. I can&apos;t watch horror movies either, (they stay in my head for weeks, maybe months,) but I can read pretty much anything in the fantasy line, except vampires.  I don&apos;t read horror, and vampires have never successfully crossed out of horror and into fantasy in any positive way for me. I mean, they are the soul less, undead. What&apos;s to like about them?    I also am very bothered by the way they shun the sunlight. I am personally very affected by the absence of light and I think a creature who lives perpetually in the dark, must be more disturbed than we can begin to imagine. There is a natural healing in sunlight that vampires never receive. When I first saw the programme,    Hoarders,    I experienced a similar feeling of horror and revulsion towards them because they choose to live in filth, (always,) and darkness, (often.)   Like the vampires they have turned away from the light with all that metaphorically implies.    Finally, consider that a vampire can turn you into a vampire against your will, they can fly and they can move unnaturally fast. The moving very fast really gets to me. They look human but they move like a housefly. That   s just wrong.  So, to summarise, vampires are creatures of horror and never creatures of fantasy for me. I don   t read horror, and actually if this course had been called, Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror, I wouldn   t have even read the details.  I would just like to add that hoarders don   t bother me half so much as vampires. After all they can   t fly and are generally pretty slow moving. Though I don   t think I could ever step inside a hoarder   s house.  ;How fast can you move,Fredrik? :);Ha! You better stay in the sun all summer long! ;);I think this is a really good idea. If people are getting   perfect scores I&apos;d love to see examples. I learn well from examples. Sadly, I don&apos;t expect to be posting any essay, but I want to encourage people who do to post here. It will help the rest of us.;Thanks so much. I had no idea that even existed.;I agree with you. I&apos;d also like if there were transcripts of the videos we could read.I do so much better absorbing information from text, plus, a few times now I&apos;ve got to the end of a video and wondered how he had got from one point to another. I would so love to just be able to read over his lecture again.I just haven&apos;t got the time to rewatch videos.;Everything is good.I just found the subtitles. I would have liked paragraphs, but hey, I&apos;ll make do. :);</string>
            <string>  &quot;I feel surrounded by military recruits rather than thoughtful peers, and their quick deification into scholars seems as playful as children acting like soldiers or parents.&quot;Beautifully observed, Joseph. Shades of the Stanford prison experiment with people identifying too strongly with their ascribed roles. I actually took this course to have fun, and read new books,   and grow as a reader and human being. I&apos;m a little shocked at the conformity of resonse expected in the essay section. I also   particularly dislike the idea that we should find something done badly in every essay and &quot;help,&quot; the writer improve. Sometimes the ideas for improvement are ridiculous and would be better   left out. What on earth is wrong with the notion of a simple and sincere response? I enjoyed your story,by the way. Hopefully you&apos;ll write many more and I&apos;ll get to grade one. I&apos;ll give you all 3s even though I disagree with the peer grading system. :);</string>
            <string>What about Swedes then? We do live in the dark for long hours for long periods throughout the year, but on the other hand I&apos;ve not seen anyone that can fly yet.

It&apos;s probably about the fear, fear makes people get more anxious, and less satisfied.  Thanks for the: &quot; Do your Best and forget the Rest.&quot; -- Bruce E Woodfield. LOL.;Hi guys, I just dropped in today, so there are a lot of catch-up to work on. I got a question here: whether or not over-interpretation, as a problem, would exist in this course (or further, in appreciating literature)? If so, should we avoid it and how?Although there still are lots of catching-up waiting for me, and Eric probably had already answered it, I do think this could be an open-ended   question, and I am looking forward your guys idea! Bravo!,Here are my idea about it:Probably it&apos;s not the case of over-interpretation, because people will interpret in totally different ways. When we communicate, we will have lot more ideas about the same material. Furthermore, think about the ideas in  Difficult Conversation,  the author encourage both side to get involved in a conversation instead of a single-sided &quot;idea pouring&quot;, and to understand each other better and more, then ultimately solve the problem, or achieve the initial goal. Maybe over-interpretation doesn&apos;t exist in the world of appreciating the literature?;</string>
            <string>There is also highlighter tape, where you can highlight but it is only tape and use that on books and take it off later.;Since I have started to read Carroll&apos;s Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking glass, much of what you wrote dealing with impossible things seem to tie neatly together. Your thesis is well supported by your examples from The Death of Hen  and The Rabbit&apos;s Bride.   You also provide an interesting conclusion that really leaves the reader with the main idea and questioning how can it be so?;I missed the deadline because most of my courses here end at 12:00 AM not PM. So, my little lost self in a whirl of summer school papers waiting patiently to be graded got the better of me! So here is my essay:  Within the context of fairy tales, many are set within a forest dealing with small children. The forest can symbolize  the journey all children must face when preparing to become adults, those dreaded teenage years. Each journey, like in Little Redcap and Hansel and Gretel, begin at home where the child feels secure with their parents and their parents looking out for them. However, when the story enters into its rising action the setting takes on a darker setting within a forest. The forest can be treacherous place which is a    dark night    (Grimm 88). Many of the characters find the forest to be frightening and have many encounters with    wild beasts    and    goblins    (214, 138).    Forests are home to creatures like &quot;witch[es],&quot; &quot;dwarves,&quot; and many different types of animals. Some of the beings can be benevolent and kind. While yet, others are referring to challenging individuals every child must face through their teen years. For instance, in Hansel and Gretel the children arrived at a house after their long journey, only to find a witch who wanted to eat them for supper. After much planning and conniving by the children, they managed to overcome the witch obstacle and go home with plenty of money. Many children face multiple kinds of obstacles in their journey throughout life.  The forest may be a symbol of a journey through life complete with the obstacles children must face in order to be adults. No one can teach the children some of these lessons except for experience and these stories teach us, the audience, that childhood is a journey through the woods with wolves and witches to snatch us on our way.  Word count: 278Any feedback would be great! Thank you so much!;</string>
            <string>My take on all this that Dracula cannot go out during the daylight hours as a man or a bat, but can function slightly in his other forms like mist and as a dog. Did anyone think it was weird that at first he could not transport the coffins of earth until later? Why didn&apos;t he realize it before hand? Don&apos;t you think he would have known he could transport them on his own before he had left Transylvania, or did he never have rhyme or reason to? I just am so baffled by this book. Like Van Helising aging so rapidly towards the end of the book...Is he a vampire too?;</string>
            <string>2nd person is when the writer uses you to describe the story and who wrote it. If you need an example, please read the following article.

            <string>As I was reading the current assignment I was very much taken aback by what I was reading.  I guess it has been a long time since I  have looked at the Grimm Brothers material.  The stories were not meant for very young children.  There are many things that would be very disturbing to sensitive young people.  For example the story of Hansel and Grethel tells about children being abandoned by their parents.  Another story with a similar theme is The Brother and Sister.  Each is played against the other.The Grimm Brothers also used other themes that would be lost on youngsters.  People need to be careful when they choose their friends and partners is another topic and conversing with animals, which I realize is the fantasy part, also a topic that children wouldn&apos;t understand.  These underlying areas make any kind of depth possible for the young reader.  The Grimm Brothers also seemed to use numerology.  They liked the numbers three and twelve.  A lot of the stories had three characters or the main character met three other people .  An example of this would be The three Spinsters and The Mouse The Bird and The Sausage.  I will say most of the stories do have happy endings.  Is this an expected ending or is it justified?I question whether these stories are actually appropriate for children or should they be given to older teens and see what they can make of them.  I think that The Brothers Grimm could probably be a course in itself.  It might&apos;ve very interesting to delve into the meaning of all the in&apos;s and out&apos;s of these fairy tales.  What were the brothers thinking when these stories were written?  We&apos;re the stories just stories meant to entertain?I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to reread some of the stories I have read before and read a lot of new stories that I found very interesting.   ;</string>
            <string>Hey all, I enrolled with this course only today and just watched the introductory videos. I suppose it would not be fair to go through the entire text assigned for unit 1 in a couple of hours in order to finish the assignment. Would i still be getting a Statement of Accomplishment if i skip on the first assignment and complete all the rest?;</string>
            <string>hI Adarsh, I am in the same position.   If you go to the page &quot;Course Syllabus&quot; then click on &quot;work expectations&quot; you will see that our grade is based on the average of our top 7 assignments. Since there are a total of ten assignments, we can skip the first one if necessary, and still have wiggle room.   good luck with the course!;</string>
            <string>Thanks so much. I was really disappointed to realize I missed the deadline. I thought it was midnight.;I am taking another Coursera course concurrently, and that one has an &quot;Assignments&quot; tab. That makes it much easier, and I was also looking for that here.;This is very interesting! I considered writing my essay about people using disguises in order to enact justice, but I hadn&apos;t thought about cloth itself as a metaphor for fate. You&apos;re right. Many characters tried to change fate by wearing certain cloths, but it did not always work.There are also stories in which disguising oneself with cloth is what leads to fate playing itself out, such as Maiden Maleen.;I agree, and your essay goes hand-in-hand with mine. (Though you might not necessarily agree with mine.) My thesis is that the stories promote the social structure of the time, though at first they appear to promote an overthrow of it. Because there is so much social movement within the stories, it leads the reader to believe in some sort of ultimate fairness or justice that will occur, in which people with virtues will be rewarded and end up holding higher places in society, and people with vices will not.;Here is my essay for the first assignment:  Grimm   s Fairy Tales promote, over and over, that an individual should accept his/her prescribed social role while acting fairly and honestly within it. At first glance the assessment that individuals should accept their roles in society might seem counter-intuitive since many stories involve characters that are poor or in lower positions within society overthrowing Kings or otherwise triumphing and moving up the social ladder.A closer look makes it clear that, on the whole, the stories do not advocate an overthrow of the social structure, however. When a lower class individual overthrows or outsmarts someone with more power, it is generally because that person has already been established as unfair. A lower class individual is portrayed as a villain when outsmarting a fair, honest person of stature. For example, the peasant in Old Hildebrand is the hero because he outsmarts the parson who wants to spend a day with the peasant   s wife, something that involves dishonesty. The waiting-maid in The Goose-Girl is not a hero for outsmarting the Princess, however, because that Princess wasn   t established as a bad person in any way.This morality is an    eye for an eye    type of philosophy rather than one focused on ideals. Breaking the social rules as a means to a greater end is fine, i.e., although trickery is despised, it is lauded when used to bring down those who used it first and are no longer considered innocent. Honesty and fairness, although highly valued, are not valued above all. Once a person has done something dishonest or unfair, the general social rules do not apply to them. Kings can then be overthrown and servants may be mistreated. This is considered justice, and those who apply it are heroes. This is seen in a multitude of stories, such as King Thrushbeard, in which the Princess is being haughty and rejecting all suitors. The King   s deceit is a good thing that both teaches the Princess a lesson and brings her greater happiness in the end. (I would argue that the Princess wasn   t doing anything wrong in the first place, but clearly she was according to the author and the social rules of the time.);Thanks for commenting on my essay. I appreciate it. I wrote it in a word processing document and was well under the word limit,   but then made some tweaks after pasting it here and I forgot to recheck it.  I think I left out a strong conclusion because I wrote something longer than the assignment. Next time I will be more careful to make sure an entire essay fits within the constraints given to us. Thanks again.;Thanks. I tried to delete this thread right after I posted it, but I guess it just deletes my comment and leaves the thread, which won&apos;t make sense to other people. Oops.;</string>
            <string>The course is well structured but the page is not . There needs to be a separate tab for assignment submissions and a mail or ticker in the timeline would be beneficial.  ;</string>

            <string>Great! I also missed the deadline for a wrong calculation and came to the forum looking to share my essay. Here it is:On the Grimm Brothers fairy tales I found a common subject: the reward for your virtue or vice.  In the tales, virtues as  humility as the goose girl who takes the job without protesting, sagacity as Clever Gretel who fools his master, solidarity as the companions on the six soldiers and many more are rewarded with the deserved kingdom, the desired pleasures and a treasure respectively. In the other hand vices have their pay back; nonsense (Hans in luck loose all what have earned), avarice (the waiting-woman is killed for her betrayal), and selfishness (the hen even causes the dead of all the animals around her).Hern  ndez, Isabel (2012) arghes that all those tales where actually taken from oral tradition. The original ones were told in order to lecture the young ones about everyday life: you should be wise so you obtain good deeds (Six soldiers of fortune, Clever Gretel) and don&apos;t be foolish (Hans in luck), not to go to dangerous places (Little red-cap).  All this is presented via universal subjects, common to all ethnics and persistent in time such as love, hatred, marriage and human relationships, even when all those have changed in time. A prove of that is that is that adaptations of the same stories are used today with the same goal.I am an amateur storyteller. When you tale a story, you don&apos;t tale it exactly as it was written. You usually make small changes to adapt the story to the audience and inevitably you put a little of your own frame of mind. The original meaning of the stories should change when the Grimm Brothers took them from the ones that told them, and adapt them to their own audience (Hern  ndez, Isabel, 2012).Note: I am not native English speaker. I will really appreciate any advice regarding the form of my writing in order to improve it. Thanks.Hern  ndez, Isabel (2012).

            <string>Thank all for your comments.Stephanie, I read my essay again and you are right, I wasn&apos;t able to keep to an idea. I will try next time to defend a thesis and defend it. I would really appreciate a proof-read for my next assignment. Thank you.Jessica, you have a good thesis, actually, the professor pointed that on the videos. Literature have always be a lecturing tool.Gracias Martha, I will look for someone to check on my writing before my next post. I will also try next time to defend a single thesis.Hi Mark, I will appeal to my fan side next time. To be sincere I didn&apos;t spent enough time in the  assignment.;</string>
            <string>                  The stories of the Grimm brothers significantly lack elements of realism, opting more for exaggeration that keep the stories more in common with folk tales than with more modern fiction, like that of novels, films, or television series. Take, for instance, in the story of Six Soldiers of Fortune, where one of the men lays down to sleep in the middle of a race where, were he to lose, his head would be chopped off. Animals all seem to be anthropomorphic, with many capable of talking to humans (as the horses in The Goose Girl story, who speak even post-mortem). These elements add a fantastical touch even in stories that lack magic in a significant form.                        As well as keeping to the unrealistic and fantastic, the stories waste no words or time, many of the stories spanning a short amount of time, with only a few vague descriptors, usually to promote the beauty (or lack thereof) of a character; as with the princess in The Goose Girl. While the fantastic nature and the lack of descriptive language of the stories would appear simple and childlike (as the stories are meant for children), the dark subject matter of the stories appears to conflict with the stories construct. This antagonistic nature of the Tales makes them all the more intriguing.;</string>
            <string>Form - 2Content - 2Very well-structured text (introduction- main body- conclusion) and good choice of subject- maybe a little broad considering the word limit. I liked the fact that you explained the title of the book and linked it to your essay, but I&apos;d like to see more evidence from the texts to support yous arguments.;Here is my assignment as well. Anxious for your comments :)On The Rabbit   s Bride       The Rabbit   s Bride discusses in a highly symbolic way, much like the myth of Persephone, the circle of life (birth- growing up- marriage- death), using animal and food imagery.       Persephone, or Kore (meaning maiden, virgin), represents rebirth, the coming of spring and vegetation, since only when she returns from the Underworld her mother, Demeter, lets the plants grow. The Maiden of the fairytale, a young girl, is responsible for the cabbages, for, when she is not there, the rabbit will eat them and the household (the smaller unit of society) will be out of food. Both Persephone and the Maiden are stolen in nature     the first when collecting flowers, the latter protecting the cabbages- by a figure symbolizing death.         Seeing the Rabbit   s Bride as Persephone, the Hare is Hades and his hutch the Underworld. The Hare, the Crow and the Fox in many mythologies are linked with death and trickery, being cunning, attractive, convincing but also dangerous and deathly. However, in the land of the dead, life can start over by a marriage, that will lead eventually to birth of children. Unlike Persephone, the Maiden never gets married to the Hare. Instead a figure made of straw    dies    and remains in the Underworld in her place reminding us of the Christian belief or the Platonic philosophy that when our body dies, our spirit goes on living. In the case of Persephone and the Maiden, they both return home continuing to protect earth   s vegetation and marking the continuing circle of life.       As a last not, fairytales, even though they are considered as stories for children, include complex mythological, philosophical and religious notions, blending traditions of different cultures and making them available to young kids in a simple, non-threatening and interesting way.  ;</string>
            <string>Here is my assignment. I would appreciate any feedback.The Grimm Fairytales are unique stories, because they use animal characters to impart moral lesson to people. At a casual reading, the analogies to humans are not evident, but on closer perusal, one can see how animals are used to represent the vulnerabilities of human character in a distanced and objective way.       The Rabbit   s Bride    follows the story of a tactless Rabbit who imposes demands on an innocent maiden.    Sit on my tail,       get to work and cook some bran and cabbage,    and    Get up! Get up!    he orders the maiden, treating her like a housewife. When the maiden escapes, the Rabbit is left    very sad,    concluding the moral of the story: those who demand selfishly only end up alone and unhappy. Through the character of the Rabbit, the reader can recognize the man that is portrayed, a counter-example of good principles.         The Death of the Hen    similarly uses animals to illustrate a warning for human beings about following others. The hen   s death from choking on a nut sends the cock in grief, which then moves all the beasts to mimic the cock   s lament. The animals follow him to a dangerous brook, where one by one, all, except the cock and dead hen, drown trying to cross the brook. Finally following after the hen, the cock    sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died.    For a fairytale, this story resonates tragically. The story exaggerates the folly of offering to help beyond one   s capabilities, a lesson being that there is nothing that left to do for one that has died, but there is no need to follow after.    The Grimm Fairytales are fantasies, woven around animal characters who do impossible things, but they are also imbedded in reality. They remain with people today, in the minds of children and adults, because the stories cautionary warnings about human nature in a memorable way.    Word count: 316  ;</string>
            <string>As it was mentioned in the introduction to the course, the texts for peer grading must be written for a fellow student who is intelligent and attentive. Only the outstanding essays should receive the grade of 3, so I think each of us will benefit from reading them (and will enjoy the process). However, only a small amount of random students will see the essay. I ask everyone who receives a grade of 3 for his/her own essay from all peers to post that essay here, so that more people will see it and, perhaps, learn something from you.UPD: the grade=3 is suggested for one of the evaluation steps, the total grade for the first assignment must be 6 (or 5 if the other part gets a 2).The rules are simple: * Post the essay as the top-level response, so that other people can comment on it* Post the screenshot of your grade with the essay, so that we can see that it really received the grade (and don&apos;t forget about the Honor Code)* Upvote this post if you are going to follow these rules and post your outstanding essays here if you manage to get a high grade.;</string>

            <string>I wonder if anyone got a high grade in those weeks that passed. If you did, please, don&apos;t be passive, share it with us.;The Seldon reference is definitely relevant. ;Please, don&apos;t write the name of the books you are not citing there. Seems obvious, but a lot of people write there the book being discussed even if they don&apos;t quote it. ;If so, the field wouldn&apos;t be named &quot;works CITED&quot;.;</string>
            <string>Everybody has his favorite book. Most of them aren&apos;t discussed in this class. However, we are learning to write and react to a specific form of essays, and perhaps by the end of the course we&apos;ll be able to do that effectively.Almost everyone would be happy to share his favorite book, and perhaps doing that in the form of the essay suitable for this course is logical.Please make an optional peer assignment (the grade on it   won&apos;t affect the final results) where we all can post essays about something wer like in our favorite book (in exactly same form as the essays we write every week). If the reader succeeds in making this essay interesting, the book will, perhaps, gain more readers. And it would be interesting to read about what other people find in their favorite books.The essay may be open now and due several days before on the end of the course, so that we can work on it without having to sacrifice the weekly essays.To readers: please upvote if you&apos;d like to write such essay.;That&apos;s the challenge of the essay: make it so interesting that the other person will want to read the book after grading.;The apostrophe (&apos;) is considered a word separator in the interface for peer assessment. However, this is not always correct --- &quot;Poe&apos;s novel&quot; contains 2 words, not 3. Perhaps it&apos;s (2 words!) needed to modify Coursera&apos;s (1 word!) system so, that it counts &quot;&apos;&quot; as a word separator only when it is encountered in special words (like &quot;it&apos;s&quot; (2 words!) ans &quot;t&apos;was&quot; (2 words)). However, some cases are hard to decide (like &quot;d&apos;Alembert&quot;);</string>
            <string>I also think this is a fantastic idea!;Seeing as you can go back and revise your feedback after its submitted, I submitted feedback based on my initial reaction then went back after watching the lectures to improve/correct my evaluations.  ;</string>
            <string>Maybe not directly related to the course as it talks mostly about the animated version rather than the actual books, but I would say still of some interest...talks about the challenges in bringing the story to the screen, and how uniquely difficult it is to adapt Carroll&apos;s writing. Personally, hearing them talk about the adaptation process gave me a different way of looking at the text.Its on Disney&apos;s Alice DVD, and here&apos;s a link on YouTube if anyone is interested:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wENbeD3XGnQ;</string>
            <string>I had a little confusion about that too. When you&apos;re discussing a specific book in the context of these essays is it necessary to cite the work everyone knows we are discussing? I was always under the impression that when you were discussing a specific work in an assignment and use no complimentary sources it&apos;s not required.;I got one of those too. It didn&apos;t make any sense at all in the context of the assignment. I gave that person a 1 for content.  ;I&apos;ve always loved both of the stories. I honestly never read the book until my teens but I was extremely fond (and still am) of the 80&apos;s made for TV version. I think the book is truly amazing in it&apos;s wordplay and commentary on absurdity in every day life. Truly it&apos;s a fantastic book for all ages.;</string>
            <string>Still one of my favorite vampire movies. Gary Oldman plays the romantic vampire while still remaining a force of evil and the presentation of the deviant sexuality inherent in vampire lore is just staggering. The only thing I really can&apos;t stand about the movie is Keeanu Reeves. Every time I hear him say Budapest or deliver the &quot;blue inferno&quot; line I start grinding my teeth.Oh, and the cello based score is rockin&apos;.  ;</string>
            <string>I personally prefer to write the essay before and watch the additional videos afterwards. They may be insightful and present a great perspective, but I certainly wouldn&apos;t be able to formulate my arguments disregarding what I&apos;d just had seen.;Thanks for this one since I was worried for joining the course today. Probably will do the same and post my Grimm essay on the forum just to receive some feedback.;</string>
            <string>This is how it works - we interpret whatever we read, see, hear.... We all look at the same things and see different pictures - it depends on individual history, experience, level of education etc.... That is why it is so interesting to exchange the different people understanding of the same books!   ;</string>
            <string>Same here! It was midnight of tonight on the calendar, but said it closed this morning. I hope this isn&apos;t a reoccurring problem. I worked today, and was planning on submitting it now. Ah well, long as we&apos;ll still be okay!  ;</string>
            <string>Are we supposed to read and grade the essays, then watch the clips, or vice versa?   Does it even matter?;</string>
            <string>I think this is something we are expected to do anyway. How exactly would you want to implement this as part of the course- our own grades being included as part of our assessment?  ;What I mean is, that that is something we should go back and do anyway. But maybe adding it as part of the course would make us more regular with it.;I would really like it if we could reply to a given review/ reviewer anonymously. Be it a clarification on a given review, or to explain a point of view. Would this be possible?;Ya, I do see that happening. But couldn&apos;t that be left up to us? As in, let us be the judge of when an argument stops being useful? And yes, it would be good to know the individual marks rather than the aggregate score as well.  ;Yes, I like that idea too!;</string>
            <string>The problem summary: I begin to work peer review part and immediately faced difficulty. The text format makes it hard to read.  Small characters with narrow line space is bad for my eyes.  I have to press Ctrl++ four times to read it comfortably. When I enlarged characters, part of the text is hidden. I have to scroll to the right and left to read. I use 4:3 screen, not the wide one. Could you do something about this problem, please?Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:;Years ago, I read books analyzing fairy tales from the standpoint of psychology. It was quite interesting. Psychological point of view may explain why some stories continued to be told for a long time and still read by young readers. Apparently it&apos;s not sense of wonder only.;</string>
            <string>Having a hard time reading Alice. I have a big hardcover version of Lewis Carrol works. Never completed reading the first story. Alice is an alien for me. Other creatures in the story sounds more easier to get along. For me, even the Illustration of Alice is rather like a horror story material, a monster. I cannot see her as a little girl. ;I find auto-caption even more ridiculous at time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQm7Ew4usw&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLBCC8A8ECEFC03E72;Trying to read this book. Since childhood, never completed even with translated ones. It&apos;s like a nightmare. Now I keep falling asleep before reaching at the end of one short sentence. Cannot continue reading. Yes, there are puns and play of words, but they are child&apos;s plays. Decades ago I read a children&apos;s wordplay book but they were more fun. Wordplay is no fun. Alice is not interesting at all. She does not think and say any interesting things. Boring conversation going on and on. End seems far away.  ;Dear Ms. Morgan,Thank you very much for the comment. Glad to learn that there are people like me. I enjoyed reading since childhood. My preference has been classical literature and natural history area. As an adult, I read SF and detective novels. I could have never become like Alice even if I tried. Those manners, teas and pretty dresses were far away from my life.  Still trying to read, though I do not think I&apos;d reach the end of the first book. I can read about those books, but not the books themselves. My brain simply refuses to process words. I chose a theme that I can write about based on the text I&apos;ve read so far. It related to my dislike of Alice.;Annotation and background knowledge is all very good. Since my order for other books are not arriving after one week, those may not be of help now. But really, Alice proved to be the most effective remedy for my sleeplessness. Since starting reading (at least trying to read) Alice, I&apos;m sleeping far more often than before. I fall asleep in record time.Fortunately, I found good audiobooks:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzQm7Ew4usw&amp;list=PLBCC8A8ECEFC03E72 http://www.booksshouldbefree.com/book/through-the-looking-glass-by-lewis-carroll They do not offend my ears.

            <string>Dr. Helsing&apos;s language sounds really weird. It&apos;s a put off. He is a highly educated man. He should be able to speak good English. A Duch person I met spoke clear British English. Is this a kind of stereotype of that age?;Oh, I was not aware of that. Thank you for the clarification.  ;It&apos;s not a modern American want-to-make-movie kinds of bloody, violence-filled novel. The tone is more religious. In a sense those hunters are saving souls; Mina&apos;s and Dracula&apos;s.   The final dash to the carts in the falling snow, confrontation with Winchesters and knives in hands might have been enough excitement.   ;</string>
            <string>I read the whole thing at last. The reading was very slow due to the dislike of the style and the two main characters. About   the writing: it&apos;s too much emotion. Hardly believe those people can remember all those feelings after a long time and want to relate those boring minute details. I remember reading Emerson for the first time. I was appalled. Could not believe any sane person would describe his feelings to that degree. (May be it was a cultural thing.) To get the sense, I deleted all the excessive emotional descriptions. Yes, I blacked them out. Very little remained. Well, I know that&apos;s not the thing you&apos;ll do to a poetry, but I was desperate to make any sense out of those overflowing words. I still cannot read that kinds of writing without getting disgusted. About the Frankenstein: I&apos;m rereading about Prometheus to see if I can find something there. If nothing else, there&apos;s a matter of morality.;</string>
            <string>I got a similar comment once that the professor wrote something like that in some other place and that I could have read that... do I have to go that far to see if my idea is original or not?In my university course in the US, I was taught how to make long and tough English sentences easier to understand. In another, that was in my country, my professor insisted that we use plain terms at all the time -- something like asking to use only words of Anglo-Saxon origins for English speakers. And he was very strict about that. Because of that I tend to react negatively to essays with big words and long sentences, though I do not reduce grade for that.  ;Is missing an &quot;-s&quot; such a horrible sin? In my language, most of the times we do not use plurals since whether it&apos;s single or plural is understood in the context. And our way of expressing plurals are different from English&apos;s. When writing in English, it requires conscious efforts to check what form I&apos;m using. Still I make a lot of mistakes. The only reason I could get through high school English classes despite failing most of weekly grammar exams was that I could read and understand. English grammar never made sense to me.           ;</string>
            <string>If I may add, not all the native speakers are proficient in their own language. They may instinctively know when something&apos;s wrong, but are they all capable of impeccable essays? Can they always correctly grasp the contents of what&apos;s written? I do not think so. And the criteria seems to differ from person to person. In a US university, before submitting any essays, I visited Language Center there to get my grammar checked. Still I got many grammatical errors pointed out when the essays are returned. I was a high school teacher and read many efforts of students. Some are good, some are very confused both in thinking and writing. Not everyone is proficient. There are various version of English in the world. Sometimes I want to tell those sticklers of &quot;correct English&quot; to go one of those countries where English is an official language and tell the local people that their English is not right.Oh, well, of course that does not make my English any better. ;I took it that this story is about what human being is meant to. To live within a safe, but narrow, closed place -- mind closed to anything new, do not try to understand things outside their own experiences -- or go out to find new horizons, with a will to go over all the obstacles. The people&apos;s blindness shows that their mind is closed. They do not accept new blood. They are doomed.   ;Even if he died, he is contented. See the description of the last scene. Flom above, the village of the blind is a &quot;pit&quot;. like hell, the land of eternal darkness. If he stayed, he&apos;d died a slow death in darkness. Nunez is in the bright light and among beautiful colors. See those delicate details Wells is describing there. His challenge may be failed, but he died as a free human being aspiring for high.   ;I have no intention of denying your reading. I was trying to explain.I&apos;m not particularly interested in their blindness as is. I am considering meanings based on the story itself, its words and expressions. What is happening in the real world is outside my scope. The blind people have a functioning community and living on their own. The problem is their decision to take away the eyesight of a man from the outside. They must make him the same with them.  This is a cruel inhumanity.  They force their view of the world to the man who knows otherwise. Their mind is so narrow, they do not consider the possibility that there could be something out there beyond their experience. That&apos;s my reading. Well, I should not repeat what I wrote before.;</string>
            <string>Hi there, fellow courserians! I&apos;m just passing by the forum to post the link where you can find these illustrations. I always liked Salvador Dali&apos;s work, but his job with Alice in Wonderland illustration is quite wonderful and unique, even for his kind of painting style (maybe because Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful and unique book too, hahah).The site with the illustations:http://www.retronaut.com/2013/06/salvadore-dalis-illustrations-for-alice-in-wonderland/The post where I found the link:http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/salvador_dalis_illustrations_for_alices_adventures_in_wonderland....;</string>

            <string>I think &quot;Dracula&quot; may have been a big inspiration for JK Rowling&apos;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. They have certain things in common... What do you think?These are the similarities I found:1. Mina&apos;s scar and her connection with Dracula. / Harry&apos;s scar and his connection with Voldemort.2. In both works, immortality is achieved in some way by the antagonist. The protagonists fight against the immortal evil being.3. Both adventures are guided by a wise old man (Van Helsing / Dumbledore)4. The epilogue! Both works comment on their aftermath various years later. In the case of &quot;Dracula&quot; we learn that Harker&apos;s son is named after the deceased Quincey Morris and their other friends. Similarly, in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; we learn that Harry and Ginny have a son named &quot;Albus Severus&quot; after their deceased friends who helped destroy Voldemort.So... What do you think? Have you found other similarities?Both works are in a way inherent to modern popular culture, and I find their relation very interesting...;I agree! The importance of knowledge, friendship, and team work are common elements.;Thanks for pointing that out Anonymous. I&apos;ve already made the correction :);Interesting thoughts. I wouldn&apos;t say that &quot;almost every book ever written&quot; share the same characteristics, but you have a very interesting point. Stories in fact repeat themselves, and new works acquire value in their re-interpretation, re-invention, re-form...Nevertheless, I still feel that Harry Potter and Dracula share something more. Maybe it is their use of certain symbols (like the &quot;mark of Cain&quot;)...;Maybe... I did grade an essay mentioning the scar connection ;);</string>
            <string>Thank for sharing! I&apos;ve always find Alice in Wonderland pretty scary, but it might be because I&apos;ve seen Disney&apos; movie when I was still a little child and didn&apos;t understand what it was about. Now, I have to be ashamed, because I&apos;ve never read it completely.  ;</string>
            <string>Are the assignments the same every week? Ie:  Essay should focus on this unit&apos;s reading   and the subject may be any literary matter that you studied in that reading: plot, style, theme, structure, imagery, allusion, narrator reliability, and so on.  If so, I can read and write ahead of time if I know the essay title is the same regardless of the text.  Thanks.  ;</string>

            <string>I&apos;d also add that1) Voldemort looks very similar to Dracula (pale skin, red eyes, long black cape)2) The more Lucy gets attacked by Dracula the more she loses her human (bodily and emotional) features, gradually becoming a disfigured monster. It is very similar to the fact how Tom Riddle gradually transforms into Voldemort after each horcrux.3) In order to destroy Voldemort, they had to destroy the horcruxes first ~ In order to destroy Dracula, they had to find the boxes filled with earth and neutralize it.;I meant that she loses her human features and starts to look like an animal (her teeth are getting sharper etc.), just like Voldemort becomes a weird snakelike creature.And yes, it was supposed to be Riddle, I&apos;ve already corrected it :);i think that a lot depends on your evaluators as well. the audience of these course is very diverse, with different horizons of expectations...;</string>
            <string>Just finished watching the rest of the Unit 1 videos and they thoroughly enriched my reading of the material :) So much to absorb, and having just done a modern history course here on Coursera as well, putting these stories in the context of the rise of nationalism was very informative, and made a lot of sense. I give the form and content of the videos each a 3. I&apos;m looking forward to hearing what Rabkin has to say about the rest of our reading.What are your guys&apos; thoughts? Anything you particularly liked about the videos, or thought was lacking?;</string>

            <string>No... it may have been the luck of the draw. I&apos;ve seen four or five responses, and I assume when there&apos;s only four one of the people assigned to my essay didn&apos;t get to it. It may be that you got only flaky reviewers this time... If you want you can post your essay here and we could provide some more responses.;Form (3): Need apostrophes for possessives, so &quot;character&apos;s&quot; instead of &quot;characters&quot; in the first paragraph, and &quot;narrator&apos;s&quot; instead of &quot;narrators&quot; in paragraph 3. I think the third paragraph might need a period at the end. Other than that, the form is really solid! Good structure with intro, body, conclusion and thesis statement all in order and clear. Your sentences are sound and well formed. Not much to complain about.Content (3): Solid analysis of the story. I like the thesis and you provide plenty of self-evident evidence to support it.Also, I myself prefer essays that focus on specific things and go deep, rather than ones with broad topics that try to encompass too much which would require much longer writing to do justice. Topics like this one fit nicely into the size we&apos;ve got, and are more likely to cover things many readers (or at least I) didn&apos;t see. Good topic choice, and good work on it!I hope others will chime in with any other thoughts.;My pleasure! The peer responses are one of the best parts of the course, and so you shouldn&apos;t go without.;</string>
            <string>One of the essays I&apos;ve received for evaluation was written by someone from Mexico, and by their writing I can tell that English probably wasn&apos;t their first language. The way they write makes the essay very difficult to understand, but I&apos;m not sure how I feel about giving them a low grade just because they have poor English. Any advice?;Thank you very much, Rachel. I probably knew that all along and just needed someone else to tell me.;</string>
            <string>I think it&apos;d be rather odd if essays were sent out in that way, especially seeing as how it&apos;s meant to remain anonymous. But I can see how that&apos;s plausible.  ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Just a basic question. I&apos;m rather busy and the two day period in between the conclusion of one unit and the beginning of the next does not afford me enough time to watch all the lectures. I hope they&apos;ll remain available after the course ends so I can go back and watch them all, can anyone confirm this for me?  ;Both in the discussion forums and the video lectures I see explorations of subjects in Dracula that I didn&apos;t see; for example, religion and sexuality. Did I miss something? I barely thought of these things while I was doing the reading.;I&apos;m talking in a less literal sense. I mean, the battle between good and evil is obviously present, but is that a wholly religious idea?;I have a feeling that, due to the period it was written in, the book is forced to exclude the &quot;interesting&quot; parts (detail on the creation of the monster and his bride, the murders, etc.) because a young woman writing something like that wouldn&apos;t have been at all appropriate.  ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Personally, I think that authors as wordy as Hawthorne are bound to slip up from time to time. Maybe his idea of that particular sentence didn&apos;t make sense with proper grammar. Grammar is necessary to making your writing understandable, but small issues like that that don&apos;t muddle up the reading of the sentence can be overlooked for the sake of art. Just my opinion.  ;</string>
            <string>I had a similar problem with one of my essay evaluations. It&apos;s a hard situation to be in and I felt the same way when grading. ): I tried just to be very honest and go by the set standards and not give preferential treatment because the writer&apos;s English was difficult to understand. It was made clear by the course background section that this class would be difficult without a comfortable level of English skills. Perhaps the best thing you can do is to be honest (but constructive!) and try to explain why it is difficult to understand so that they can improve for future essays. ;No troubles, it&apos;s a hard situation. ;</string>
            <string>This is the Merriam-Webster english learner&apos;s definition for GRAMMAR http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/grammarLiterature and grammar go hand in hand. In order to get your point across you must be able to use proper grammar. Even as a native English speaker I make mistakes (even with spell check). I would be graded and judged on my content and form because of my grammar. If I were taking a class in French I would still be expected to be graded on grammar. I gave a 1 when there were obvious mistakes in the essay I evaluated. How else is one to learn? We are all here to develop our use of language and understanding and grammar is part of that. ;</string>
            <string>Since I&apos;m assuming that all the videos are pre-recorded (the course was taught before), is it possible to release them at the beginning of the work cycle rather than two days before the beginning of the next unit?   Many of us have demanding schedules, and we would be able to manage the requirements of the course better if you give us everything up front (videos, grading assignments, etc.) and then gave us a full week to complete them.   Having only 48 hours to watch numerous video lectures and grade 5 writings is really tough if they happen to be the busiest 48 hours of my week.   Also, releasing videos on last week&apos;s reading just as we&apos;re starting the new text is a lot for us to juggle.   It also makes it so that busy people are a lot less likely to go back and watch those videos because the rest of the class is moving on!   It seems more pedagogically sound to watch these lectures as we&apos;re reading to allow us to focus entirely on one text, and not move foward and backward at the same time.   I completely understand that you don&apos;t want to spoil our reading by releasing videos too early, and I know that a lot of thought went into planning the timing of the course.   However, if we&apos;re all adults who have signed the honor policy, we&apos;re here because we genuinely want to learn, we&apos;re balancing this course with other responsibilities, and since these lectures have already been recorded, then I think it&apos;s reasonable to allow us to have access to these lectures earlier in the week.   Do others agree?   Is there a chance that some of these changes can be made?ThanksDave;</string>
            <string>Just a quick thought while watching the first of the &apos;after reading&apos; videos....I understand the professor&apos;s point that the tales don&apos;t necessarily have &apos;morals&apos;, but when reading this tale I didn&apos;t really think of the the daughter as being the liar.   The mother started the lie, the daughter can be seen as being loyal to the mother by not correcting the lie and therefore sullying the mother&apos;s word/reputation.   Then at the wedding the daughter/bride invites the three women in   as opposed to other girls in other tales who are cruel/break promises   to ugly characters and thereby incite their wrath. By keeping her word to the spinsters the daughter is rewarded by never having to spin again (or I guess actually   fake spinning again).     My point is I saw the girl as a dutiful daughter and keeper of promises (which is why she was rewarded), even if she was lazy and wouldn&apos;t learn to spin. :)And as an aside I can also see a more modern feminist reading of this as the solidarity of women-hood or some such--but sometimes I think we read more into these tales than we should :)Any way--just something that popped in my head. I meant this to light and fun in tone--not something that always comes across on the internet!;I totally agree that the mother and daughter were cunning. I think that&apos;s part of what I like about this story. And I understand the spinster/fates connection.  I also think I personally enjoy this story as a tale of the lower class/underdog &apos;getting one over&apos; on the upper class.   If the situation were reversed and the Queen or Prince were taking advantage of a peasant and her daughter I would think that the tale was just awful.   But I guess that&apos;s human nature :)  I can also personally identify with wanting to get out of housework!   Though for me spinning is a fun hobby and not work. :)Obviously these are just fun personal observations and not meant as a great scholarly discourse. Watching the &quot;Rapunzel&quot; video now and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever be able to do an actual &quot;close&quot; reading---totally missed the whole &apos;eye&apos; imagery thing.   And my ideas about sexuality in &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; are entirely different than the professor&apos;s--it&apos;s actually what I wrote my essay on.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m just a lay person interested in learning more about fairytales--can anyone recommend some good books?   I&apos;m especially interested in learning more about older versions of tales.   I knew from my readings before this course that the Grimm versions could be considered &quot;adulterated&quot; and I knew the Perrault wrote to entertain the French court, but was there anyone who actually went out into the countryside and collected tales?   And what about   a lot (not all) of modern day fantasy writers who like to find pagan symbols behind the &quot;Christianized&quot; tales?   Are there really older versions of these tales that predate European Christianity that can be prescribed pagan meanings/symbols?   Does it even matter?  I know some of these questions have been touched on in other threads, but I&apos;m hoping that some of   you well read scholars could suggest some further reading for me.   I poked around in the course links but couldn&apos;t really find anything as far as a &apos;suggested further reading list&apos;--but if I missed it please let me know!Thanks in advance!;</string>
            <string>This is an interesting view indeed. However, the mother and the daughter remain cunning. It can be seen as a story of cunning and social genius. The mother seized the opportunity to find her daughter a great husband. The daughter was witty enough to secure the marriage and relief herself from the spinning duties to the end of her life. So, it is the mother and the daughter outwitting the queen and her son in a game of marrige.The Element of the three spinsters remain as a mysterious hand. Why do they appear? Here comes the professor&apos;s link to the Three Sisters of Fate. The girl was meant to marry the prince, and they came to make sure of it. They spinned her marriage, and they asked to be acknowledged. The girl is smart: she acknowledged them, and secured a good living.Well, until they cut the thread.At face value, the story has no moral that a parent would like to teach their child, except that: if I lie, continue my thread of lies. However, as a story about fate in marriage, it is solid.This is a personal opinion, of course.;</string>
            <string>I feel that the interaction between the Caterpillar and Alice is like one between a school teacher and student. Throughout the books there are references to lessons (which are often cited incorrectly). I think this is Carroll taking the mickey out of what could only be thought of as the education system (which much of the western world has inherited). Students recite things over and over without any actual understanding of what they are doing, yet creativity and passion is ultimately lost.;Do not think of the book as being set in Wonderland. Imagine that you are a child in Victorian England: the absurd societal rules that do not make any sense, the easily offended characters, the prudish and snobbish nature of society (and the accompanying ambiguity), the way you are treated (as a silly child). Perhaps then it might make more sense?;It has been suggested that this is an allusion to a food chain: raven eats worm, worm eats desk. Food as a means for (almost immediate) physical and emotional change is constant throughout the books. The food chain could be symbolic of this change in the &quot;real world&quot;?  As to the &quot;answer&quot; to the riddle: it is probably more symbolic of the ridiculousness of wonderland, and has no &quot;real&quot; (logical) answer.;Very nicely summed-up. However, advanced vocabulary can often reflect a very poor writing style. It reminds me of when Faulkner spoke of Hemingway:    &apos;He has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the  dictionary.&apos; To which Hemingway replied, &apos;Does he really think big emotions come from big words?... There are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.&apos;  My advice: Beware of the big words!*Not that I was there at the time.;Point taken :-);I was actually thinking about this for my essay topic.The thin line between sanity and madness is crossed by almost all the characters for various reasons (desire for longevity, grief, mania in the irony). Perhaps denying truth, in Harkers case, leads to insanity; acceptance of truth leads to recovery. Often superstition is thought of as a result of madness, yet denying the reality of Dracula (in the book, of course) and not having an open mind results in denial (which leads to uncertainty and madness).;Random, but all I could think of was this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp3WrHxo4rA  It is called a trip to the moon and is one of the oldest sci fi films out there. The director was  the inspiration for the story Hugo.;</string>
            <string>So glad you did this. I had a horrible desire to brag, but it felt so shameless. :-) Also, if I went to my friends and told them I got a 6 they would not really know what was going on.___________&quot;Alice&quot;  is laced with societal metaphors, but multiple direct references to school and formal learning reminds me of Ken Robinson&apos;s Ted Talk on How School is Killing Creativity. The Victorian education system, inherited throughout much of the modern World, is probably a theme with which many of us can associate.  The &quot;dry&quot; lecture from the mouse places one directly in a classroom situation where (boring/dry) information is given.  Alice&apos;s recital of poetry to the caterpillar reinforces that the correct lessons should be done exactly, with little appreciation of the creativity in the &quot;incorrect&quot; version. Similarly, the Mock Turtle and the Red and White Queens (in TTLG) compare thier own levels of education with Alice, often with amusing and pun-filled faults. Alice&apos;s recitations of school geography and arithmetic while she falls through the rabbit hole in the beginning is equally incorrect, but fun. It is likely, ironically enough, that these punny faults will be picked up by young Victorian children studying these topics quite quickly, preventing them from making future mistakes.    However, despite the  playfully serious  nature  of these direct scenes  (Can anyone talk about  Alice  without using oxymorons?), one cannot help but notice the multiple lessons referenced throughout the text: politics (the teasing of the royal court), mathematics (which will undoubtably be discussed by many other students) and history (the War of the Roses reflected in the painted roses; the bloodthirsty Mary I screams of &quot;off with his head&quot;). However, these lessons are filled with puns and fun and, more importantly, creativity.  This also reflects the nature of Carroll, himself: on one hand an educated mathematician and logician, and, on the other, the author to the wonderfully creative &quot;Alice&quot;. The education system, being a vessel for logic and arbitrary seriousness, at the risk of losing creativity, has not changed much over the last century. Carrolls mockery of it still applies today.;Thank you :-);Thank you guys :-) Anon, I actually thought the same thing and worried that I would get less than 4 for that reason. I think it very much depends on what the peers you get want. I remember handing in a draft for my masters and got feedback from both my supervisors: one said &quot;too much detail, we know!&quot; and the other said &quot;what do you mean?&quot; for the exact same sentence!  ;That&apos;s really sweet, thank you! Actually, this course (and a very inspirational talk I saw) encouraged me to start a little short story tumblr blog. I was only going to &quot;reveal&quot; it once I had enough practice and felt a bit more confident but I could always do with some criticism as well.  http://kerrynsshortstories.tumblr.com/  :-);Thank you, Florencia :-) &quot;Thier&quot; is a typo that haunts me most successfully, unfortunately. And thank you, Rosie. I would love to read something from you as well! I have been searching for short stories on the net!;I wouldn&apos;t mind seeing it... :-) sounds like a bit of a technicality.  ;Random, but in South Africa there is a superstition regarding the &quot;Tokolosh&quot;, a small, mischievous evil spirit. Always wanted to do a horror story on that, ala Lovecraft :P I suppose a space-&quot;Alice&quot; would also be fun, being beamed up into a random spacecraft versus falling into a rabbit hole.;Your post reminds me of a paper I read recently on how the greater your education the less diverse your group of friends. Which is a pity. Just because people do not have an &quot;educated&quot; view on a topic does not mean they do not have something valuable to say. I find that many of my similarly-educated friends are lovely, but quite boring in the sense that everything I say needs to make sense and be backed up by fact, which is exhausting and terribly uncreative! I understand frustration in ignorance (every time I read/hear &quot;the next step in evolution&quot; in sci-fi I want to throw a biology book at the authors head), but you cannot pretend that just because people do not know what you know means that they can&apos;t teach you something new.;What an interesting idea for a topic! I think there also are other strange similarities between Vampires and Christian beliefs (raising from the dead; drinking the blood).  From a historical point of view, the vampire lore (or like ideas) Stoker has &quot;inherited&quot; is from Eastern Europe. Perhaps Eastern Europe *guessing*, being much affected just before this time by the rise of the Ottoman Empire (Turks or Muslims), may be more sensitive to Christianity=Good, warding off evil?  ;I was wondering if there are particular pieces from Poe which are more necessary to read. I would love to read it all, but if I do not, how will I be able to evaluate peers that mention/choose an unfamilar story?;Oh yes, thank you very much!;Thank you. I also found a list on the syllabus for poe:    Poe&apos;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Oval Portrait,&quot; &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee.;</string>
            <string>Would a very respectable 60 year old man execute a better story? I understand that we should evaluate the book but I&apos;ve seen many posts that are unnecessarily critical. If you cannot get into the book, that&apos;s understandable for many reasons, but not because the author is an adventurous romantic.;Ok fair enough. I suppose I, in turn, am bias because Shelley had raw experiences (despite certain privileges). Sci-fi is sometimes not taken seriously because it is not &quot;real&quot; (different from realistic). Frankie is a classic example that this isn&apos;t so. At least in my opinion. That doesn&apos;t make me like Victor, but I do like how Shelley makes me feel.;Victor reminds me of Lady Stark from Game of Thrones. But in first person.;I think so too. I actually also wonder if Frankenstein learnt his lesson. He seems to need the creature (an excuse for his misery? an excuse to leave his normal life?). At some point he talks about how peasants are free when everything is taken from them. He talks about how miserable he is, but I don&apos;t actually get that impression from his actions. I think he needs the creature as much as the creature needs him.;Hi everyoneDoes anyone know anything about the Hawthorne/Dumas plagiarism accusation (Dr Heidegger&apos;s Experiment)? I imagine fountain of youth stories may just have been popular or Dumas read it before and forgot how it was incepted, but not sure.;</string>
            <string>This is just a little aside to your question. I am not suggesting another collection of fairy tales, but rather a wonderful resource which explains fairy tales a little better and which I love to re-read every now and then. The book is called Touch Magic by Jane Yolen. It is her insight into the deeper symbology of fairy stories which I find very helpful. Enjoy!;</string>
            <string>Interesting thread. The idiomatic representations in the book make it an interesting read mostly for a fluent English reader. It would lose most of its flow in the narrative were it translated. Although some European languages may still retain their flavour, Alice travelling across continents would be a great challenge. I am working my essay around it. Thank you for this initiation :);Would be honoured to, Gabriela. Certainly. Would love to read your work in return.  ;</string>

            <string>Hi Kevin. Your idea is very interesting. The idea of the monster does feel like one of the products of human imagination. I felt that could this monster be the evil &quot;Other&quot;   to Frankenstein&apos;s noble pursuit of knowledge. Both pursue education tirelessly, and perhaps were potentially intellectually equal(monster having little exposure). but they result in characteristically different individuals. There is a possibility that the monster is actually just a creation of an alternate identity.  ;</string>

            <string>Sorry about missing the deadline of assignment 1. But I still want to share my thoughts of little red cap to all of you. It&apos;s my pleasure to have any comments of you, thank you.My interpretation of little red cap who described as a maid in the tale is the newbie of the society. This youngster was curious about all new things and had no idea of the nature of them. She followed to what the wolf said first time, who I think represents the desire, the greed and the sin because the wolf just said nice words to her, the young lady with no experiences. However, little red cap, who was easy to absorb new things and easy to believe stranger&apos;s words also very insightful. She recognized that the door standing open (pp. 133), and the unusual features of &quot;grandmother&quot; though she had no fear nor solution to react this situation. What&apos;s more, she&apos;s also a quickly learner for she never making the same mistake at all.  Speaking of grandmother, who was full of love and kind and wisdom, I consider her as the god mother. She seldom said any words but be very nice to little red cap. The mother asked little red cap to bring bread and wine to her grandmother, which indicated that it&apos;s a sacrifice to the god mother. What&apos;s more, the mother said: Make haste and start before it grows hot, and walk properly and nicely (pp.132) don&apos;t forget to say, Good morning, instead of staring about you. (pp. 132) This part is so likely to make a pilgrimage or go to church to pray on Sunday mornings. Though the grandmother was weak in the tale, it didn&apos;t mean she&apos;s feeble. Her physical body was really weak but the spirit wasn&apos;t. Also in the second part of the story grandmother was a wise skillful old woman who gave instructions to little red cap in order to help her fight the devil wolf, which also demonstrates that she&apos;s in the upper level and love little red cap, the youngsters in her way.;</string>
            <string>Till now, a 5.5-6 and a 4-6 on my first two essays. Not bad, I think, considering the word limit and that English is my third language: I&apos;ve already received a few friendly warnings about some flaws in grammar and spelling... *BLUSH*;https://www.plagtracker.com/report/2d389312ba305bc0beba74d953ed7e32/  -  Our [plagtracker]  advice:  Wow, your paper is awesome and you&apos;re a master!  6% of non-unique content.

Better yet, even the page of a book or a long article.Better luck for the next assignments.;</string>
            <string>Some of the comments were constructive but others just rude.  I would never write anything unkind in my feedback - it&apos;s unhelpful and unprofessional. ;</string>
            <string>I wish I&apos;d been reviewing your work, sounds fascinating!;</string>
            <string>Thanks to my reviewers. They were tough, but correct. I was not satisfied with my essay, but couldn&apos;t pinpoint the problem. Now, I can apply what I learned to future essays.;</string>
            <string>I take and offer each review with a grain of salt. No one is perfect. I chuckled when sentences and paragraphs were described as too short. Unfortunately in a society where speech is reduced to sound bites, where texting is a major form of communication and where sentences which are short, concise - and uncomplicated - are praised, practise with writing long complex sentences, which attempt to address nuance and subtlety, while striving to maintain a strong sense of energy, is often lacking. Contradictory reviews add another note of humorous interest when considering the reviews.;I see the tension between extra-natural and technological as two circles with one wrapping the other. I am using the word extra-natural because I want to get away from the connotations of supernatural. The inner circle is the natural world - but with a twist. The twist is the extra-natural world which, while following its own rules, exists outside the natural world. It exists as its own nature which parallels the world of nature as we see it.Surrounding this world as an evolutionary development for a society is the technological world. The technological world of typewriters and phonographs is a sort of layer that overlays the natural world.The emphasis on technology - and by extension science, including the science of the human mind - might be an implicit suggestion that the natural world itself is subject to the examination of science and manipulation of technology. But with the additional piece that while Dracula exists in the extra-natural world where he can change form and influence the winds, that possibly even the extra-natural world can be subject to the scientific mind if only the right tools and thinking is applied. I suggest this because van Helsing&apos;s scientific approach implies that science and logic can be used to defeat Dracula - because even though Dracula has powers that exceed the natural universe - that he still has weaknesses and rules. The existence of rules, patterns and needs make the object of study still available to study and control by science. Even the use of religious things can still be part of the scientific approach since the religious things (such as a cross) are still considered to be facts of the natural world.Thinking this out leads me to wonder if part of the subtext of Dracula is a question of what is reality. Is Stoker implying that what we consider reality is probably just one aspect of that reality but that there are more levels and layers of reality? What layers might they be? Both microscopic and cosmological; single cells under the microscope and stars in the telescope. Even atomic theory, the implication of which we do not see with our eyes, but which manifests in the forms of heat energy for nuclear power plants and the explosive material of nuclear bombs. So maybe Stoker is using a literary tool to declare that he believes that reality is much wider and deeper than most people believe. Shakespeare said it best when he wrote, &quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot;;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>One peer reviewer wrote that I must not be a native speaker of English because the sentence structure was weird. If nothing else that provided a good laugh.;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m am also very frustrated that we can&apos;t respond. I got a low scote from one of my reviewers because I &quot;restated what the professor said&quot; instead of &quot;coming up with an idea on my own&quot;. The deadline to submit our essay was BEFORE he released the first lecture. He just so happened to mention something I chose to write about.  ;</string>
            <string>AN ESSAY IN THE FOLKTALE FORM So it came to be that many, many years passed, and the famous frog prince and his beautiful princess had many children, who in turn had many children. Children multiplied throughout the forests, all over the oceans, and especially in the busy castles, which in turn begot more castles, which became great cities filled with tall places and dark places and nice and nasty places. Before they knew what happened to them over these many, many years, all these children became big. Sadly, some died before they could get full size, but countless children became big and old. They started to hate what they once were. They started to hate children. So it came to be that if a big princess were having an unwanted child, she would yank it out, throw it against the wall, and hope it would become a handsome prince just as her ancestor did many years ago. Alas, there were no more princes, no more kings, only helpful providers who gave the big and the old magic potions and promised them they would live forever if only they would replace their parts when these parts stopped working. So it came to be that the big and the old had their knees, their hips, and their hearts replaced, but still their souls grew tired of living in their old bones and left them rattling and powerless. Other children survived their princess mothers    trauma to become resources for the providers to fix the big and the old. Still other children went every day to places called day care to get big and old faster and spend their time with making money like their elders. This is very terrible, thought a few artists and teachers, whom the providers turned into dogs. Soon there were no more children, no more animals, no more fish, no more forests, only many physicians, professors, and providers. Then later they too all died.  ;ESSAY IN A FOLKTALE FORM AND COMMENTS AND SCORES FROM PEERS FOLLOW, THANK YOU FOR ASKING                              So it came to be that many, many years passed, and the famous frog prince and his beautiful princess had many children, who in turn had many children.

OUR PEERS&apos; COMMENTS ON FORM FOLLOW: peer 2     This is not an essay. I believe the author is trying to write his/her own version of a fairy tale, which to my knowledge was not the assignment. At least it is creative! peer 3     Well done dear, your languages are well spelt out and your sentences are well constructed. however your argument is a little weak and needs serious improvement, i did not fully understand the idea or message that you tried to pass across, i do not know if it is for my lack of understanding or that the message is not properly conveyed. i hope you will do better in other assignment. peer 4     Creativity is certainly at will. The structure is well, although repetitions could have been avoided. PEERS&apos; COMMENTS ON CONTENT: peer 2     The piece does demonstrate understanding of the fairy tales and remarks on their consequences in modern day society. I cannot really find an argument to evaluate that is related to the text. To my knowledge, the assignment said specifically not to try to remark on modern issues outside of the literary world, but rather to analyze the fairy tales themselves. I don&apos;t think I can give this piece a strong score. peer 3     Well there is no strong argument or insights in your essay, i tried to see if there is any moral lesson that i can learn from the write up but could not find any; i suggest that you make more researches on essay writing and improve your self for a better write-up in the near future. peer 4     I didn&apos;t see any point to be discussed or analysed. Maybe stating what such comparisons or analogies should be considered, by this way the creative aspect could serve as a guide. THEIR SCORING FOR BOTH FORM AND CONTENT IS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE:  FORM 1 and CONTENT 1. THEIR FINAL COMMENTS FOLLOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST. peer 3     It is a good start up, please if you can improve in the areas i pointed out you will be perfect. peer 4     ;Poulomi, thank you so much for appreciating my response to the assignment and for expressing yourself clearly and concisely. Sometimes in a course like this I feel surrounded by military recruits rather than thoughtful peers, and their quick deification into scholars seems as playful as children acting like soldiers or parents. Some of us take our role-playing far too seriously for we easily forget the bigger game called real life. What I miss in a course like this is not the teacherly thousands but the few students who want to think about what they are learning and apply it to the contemporary world we share. At any rate, Poulomi, thanks for letting me know that at least one peer is thinking outside the boxes.  ;Thank you, Sharon. That psychological experiment should be better known. It is so apt and worrisome. It is  The Lord of the Flies that comes to my mind when I try to understand the intellectual boot camp camaraderie over this assignment. This is not a writing course, but its structure dangerously misleads the drill  sergeants standing over their peers.  Thanks again. Cheers!;Let&apos;s not overemphasize grades. Rather what these books and lectures involve should be our focus. Another literary course, The Fiction of Relationship, goes to great lengths to avoid the attitudes expressed so profusely in this course. If you are interested, Professor Arnold Weinstein&apos;s guidelines for that course follow: On Peer Assessment and Course Credit To pick up where we left off with the Announcement of yesterday, 14 June 2013, the question was asked:   How do the grades I get on my papers affect my chances at getting credit in the course     whether it   s a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  All Statements of Accomplishment and Statements of Distinction are based on whether you have completed the written assignments in a satisfactory manner.    Satisfactory completion    of the written assignments means that you have scored at least a one (1) on all required written assignments. In other words, you did not score a zero (0) on any assignment. If you do score a zero (0), then the material you submitted has been deemed incomplete by your peers in the course. With an incomplete on one assignment, you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction.  OK. But how do I avoid a zero (0)? What kind of work could be scored a zero (0)?  Incomplete written work     work worthy of a zero (0) No Credit     can take many forms. The submitted essay may be blank; the submitted essay may contain completely unreadable text, or it may have text duplicated again and again to fill the required minimum of words. These papers are primarily what we have in mind when defining what is worthy of a zero (0). Incomplete work may, however, also include essays that are clearly and significantly fewer than the word minimum required by the assignment. So     if you submit only a 5-word, a 50-word or a 200-word response to the 300-word analytical or creative prompt, this would not be sufficient. That paper would be incomplete and worthy of a zero (0).  Please take note of what is not an Incomplete or zero (0).  Incomplete essays are not essays the peer assessor simply disagrees with, or thinks are unintelligent. You are, of course, encouraged to disagree and debate the claims made by your classmates, but do not mark essays with a zero (0) simply because you think the paper is wrong. Instead, use the comments section in peer assessment as an opportunity to vigorously and respectfully debate their claims. That will be more rewarding for you and for the student who submitted the paper. Further, incomplete essays are also not essays that simply have grammatical or formal mistakes (even many, many mistakes). So long as the essay is readable and strives to engage with that week   s reading in what appears to be a sincere and honest way, the paper is worthy of a grade above zero. **Lastly, on this point, we at Brown University are very aware that the student body of this course is very diverse, comprising many native speakers of English but also many non-native speakers who may not have much experience with argumentative writing in English. We ask that all students respect this fact and keep it in mind when peer-reviewing the essays. First and foremost, the goal of our peer assessment system is to help others improve their writing and improve their interpretative ability with literary texts. Those who possess strong skills in these areas have an important role to play in respectfully critiquing the writing of others who want to better their own interpretative abilities in the English language. Yes, you must assign a numerical grade to each paper, but we encourage all peer assessors to concentrate less on the number and more on engaging your classmates with critical comments and helpful feedback in each review.  The real value of peer assessment lies in your willingness to debate and help your classmates explore the substantive ideas of their essays!  So are you saying that I can get the lowest passing score [a one (1)] on all analytical and creative papers, and still receive credit for the course -- a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Yes. You need to score only a one (1) on all required assignments to get a Statement. Of course, in order to fully complete each of these assignments, you must also assess the work of at least three of your peers. Peer assessment is an indispensable part of each paper.  Do all the papers follow the same rubric or scale of grading for peer assessment?  No. The 300-500 word analytical papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-3 with three (3) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 300-500 word creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2 with two (2) being the highest score, and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 1000-1300 final paper will be reviewed on a combination of the above scales with an overall total of five (5) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper.  OK, I know that zero (0) is an incomplete on a peer-graded assignment, but what does a one (1), a two (2) or a three (3) mean?  For an explanation of these numbers on the analytical papers, we refer you to the assignment on Manon Lescaut where their meaning is clearly laid out in the Evaluation/Feedback section on that page. The creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2. There is no grade of three (3) for creative papers. When peer-assessing the creative papers, you will use this criterion. You will be asked the simple question,    Did this paper deepen your understanding of the    Fiction of Relationship    both as it relates to this week   s text and as it exists in the world at large?    If your answer is yes, you award the paper a two (2), and then carefully explain how and why it deepened your understanding. If your answer is no, you award the paper a one (1), and then respectfully explain how and why the paper failed to deepen your understanding of that week   s reading. If the paper is incomplete (see the guidelines set out in points #2 and #3 above), assign the paper a zero (0) for No Credit (NC).   I understand how the 300-500 word creative papers will be graded. But what exactly is a creative paper? How is it different from the analytical paper I am writing this week?  In the analytical papers, we ask you to compose and defend your own argument about the novels    formal qualities, themes and/or structure. We hope you   ll break down or    loosen up    the significance behind particular scenes, characters, or literary elements through your interpretation (the term, analysis coming from the ancient Greek verb,  _  _         _ _, meaning    to unloose, to investigate, to set free, to resolve, to loose from moorings   ). We want you to focus on and closely read precise features of the language used in the stories, and when possible, you should relate their meaning to the larger themes of the course. In the creative papers, by contrast, we ask you to respond to specific language in a prompt based on each text. The goal here, however, is not analysis as such, but synthesis instead--the term, synthesis, coming from the ancient Greek for    a putting together, a joining, a combination or composition of parts so as to form a whole   . What this means, in practical terms, is that you should explore the questions raised by the prompt, not just as they relate to that week   s reading, but also as those questions converge and merge with something outside the limits of our class   s reading list, whether that something is an object, an experience, or a theory you know and think applies to the reading and the prompt.  You have great freedom to choose a focus here. You could, for example, decide to write a philosophical reflection comparing or contrasting the themes of that week&apos;s reading to another novel, poem, work of visual or musical art, philosophical approach, religious practice, or scientific theory you know well.  You could also choose to compose a piece of short fiction or poetry for your creative paper. However, if you select this option, we ask that you provide your reviewers with a rationale of approximately 150-200 words, explaining how your poem or piece of fiction is related to the prompt given.  The form your creative paper takes is yours to determine. It is the work of your imagination, but you should make every effort to link it to the week&apos;s reading and the language set out in the prompt.  Can you elaborate on what is required for the final paper (1000-1300 words)? Is it different than the analytical and creative papers?  We will explain the final paper in greater detail a few weeks prior to its due date. But for now, let   s ensure we are clear on the expectations for the 300-500 word analytical and creative papers.  OK, can you recap? What do I need to do get credit in this course? Whether I want a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Here   s a summary.  To get a Statement of Accomplishment you must: A. Do the reading over the first six weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: One 300-500 word Analytical Paper One 300-500 word Creative Paper One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Module One, you will assess nine papers. To receive a Statement of Distinction, you must:  A. Do all the reading over twelve weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: Two 300-500 word Analytical Papers Two 300-500 word Creative Papers One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Modules One and Two, you will assess a total of at least fifteen papers.  Finally, if you have further questions about peer assessment, course credit or about any of the written assignments, we encourage to let us know through an appropriate thread on the discussion forum.  ;</string>
            <string>Just now started a new thread asking for the staff for &quot;Statistics, please, so we can understand what is meant by&quot; the work expectations numbering system. Then I stumbled on to this thread and realized I am not the only one trying to understand it.;&quot;If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment.   If, though, five average 2 and two average 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.7 and will not have earned your Statement of Accomplishment.&quot; So if I understand this work expectation correctly, if someone gets a 1 in form and a 1 in content six times and on a seventh essay he or she somehow gets a 1 only in either form or content for a total score of 13 for the 7 essays, he or she will have an average of 1.85 (13/7=1.85). Thus a 1 in form and a 1 in content equal a 2 for grading the essay overall, correct? (And the statistics are calculated as expressed that way, and they are NOT calculated by being separated into each essay&apos;s form and content grade individually so that in the example above, the student receiving a total of 13 for 7 essays, his or her total of 13 would be divided by 14 because of the 14 form and content grades, and the result of each being counted separately would have been 0.93 (13/14=0.93). Is the former the correct way to understand your expectation?) This could be more clearly stated by me so it is more easily understood, but I don&apos;t want to misunderstand and do think the staff needs to make sure the class understands this correctly so that the anxiety expressed over peer reviews might be mitigated a little.Also, staff, it would be nice to know the statistics on the percentages of 1, 2, and 3 grades being given so that the class can benefit from knowing whether on not Prof. Rabkin&apos;s statistical projections for the numbers in the course are on track or not. His stated emphasis on percentages for handing out 1, 2, and 3 grades may have had a chilling effect on peer responses or not. We don&apos;t know, and I think, we should know so we can adjust grading accordingly to his guidelines.THANK YOU! GREAT WORK SO FAR!;Thank you, Maria. Perhaps you and Daniel cannot see the problem, but the course work expectations page explicitly states: &quot;you will have an average of approximately 1.85 (NOT 3.6!) and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment.&quot; ;Thank you again, Paul John, Maria, and Daniel, for your interpretation here and on another thread about grades of  4 being good. You may be right, but do the math as I have done in my original thread:  6 submissions with 2, 1 with a 1, is 13 divided by 7, and equals 1.85 as is expressed on the work expectations page. If I do the math as you and others suggest (Are any of  you on the staff at UM Coursera?), then the result is 6 submissions with 2 on form and 2 on content, and 1 submission with 1 on form and 1 on content and this then equates to  12 2&apos;s and 2 1&apos;s. This 24 plus 2 equals 26 and  divided by 14 equals 1.85. Either way approximates the same numerical result, as Paul John just realized with his spreadsheet.  Then let&apos;s move to the other example: 5 submissions with 2&apos;s and 2 with 1&apos;s, equals 12 divided by 7, equals 1.7 as is expressed on the course site. Then let&apos;s calculate the same example the way you understand it: 5 submissions with 2 on form and 2 on content (or substitute the equivalent 3&apos;s and 1&apos;s) and 2 with 1&apos;s on form and 1&apos;s on content. Let&apos;s see that seems to be 24 (20 plus 4)  divided by 14 and  voila! 1.7! This is in part what is confusing people  (or worse)  on the  forum about grading: either way the math  nets the same results. Now please try to understand the following.So, is  this course dedicated to  having people complete the assignments from all around the globe with different levels of writing and  English literature backgrounds and getting at least 1 on form and 1 on content (this  would be my assumption) rather than not do the assignments at all or  submitting nonsense and getting a 0 on form or a 0 on content? Or, is this course dedicated to  ensuring  competency in  short thematic essays which seems to be perhaps yours and others interpretation by requiring better than average native skills in English writing and in  literary comprehension?Which is the course&apos;s philosophy? There seems to be more at stake here than you  realize, and I hope the staff or Professor Rabkin clarifies what audience he is trying to cultivate with this course: an eager-to-learn, global, student body, or ageless, aspiring English majors?In the meantime, I wish you all the very best, (3&apos;s!) for the class and in life.;Never mind, it&apos;s useless to continue this discussion for we agree on the math but disagree on the conclusions to draw from the how the same results are calculated. You say a student cannot have a 1 on form and nothing for content. Yet, say, by submitting just one good sentence totally irrelevant to the course assignment, or 320 words of gibberish as imitative content without a modicum of style, that student could be graded 1 only, and his or her average for that one assignment would be 1; and I know you can say that the average for that submission is .5 because you have to count the missing component as a 0, but that is not explicit on the work expectations page, 1/1 averages 1 as does 2/2. The component not completed may or may not be counted for surely the assignments not being done at all are not being figured into the averaging. There is effort expended in submitting gibberish poetry as content as well as effort in lifting a sentence from Shakespeare. Maybe that effort deserves 1/1 or 1/2 or 0. The different ways of understanding the course&apos;s philosophy for global grading needs staff clarification. Thanks again for your interpretation.  ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Thinking about the essay you are grading, Alexander, I feel that the writer may deserve a 3 and not a 1 or a 2. This peer is following the professor&apos;s lead who clearly and thoroughly situates Frankenstein in post-Renaissance history. The essay you mention seems to me to take seriously and quite specifically the extra-literary context that makes literature like Frankenstein into a enduring mental icon as Krautheimer&apos;s NYTimes article and other contexts presented in the professor&apos;s videos show. Perhaps the peer will post it a thread here, I hope so for I would like to read it.;</string>
            <string>Hi,I decided to post my essay here, too. It is a way to show how the same essay can produce different reactions. I consider peer 4 very harsh. Mainly, when s/he says things like: &quot;the writing is altogether too confusing and disengaging&quot;; &quot;there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer&apos;s argument&quot; (I thought rhetorical questions had the power to engage the reader and give the opportunity for reader to make up his/her own ideas about the question); &quot;Organize your thoughts before you write an essay&quot; (Are they really so  disorganized?); &quot;try reading it to yourself, and think if a 3 year old could understand it&quot; (I think this is hilarious); &quot;try not to write as you speak, but follow the grammatical rules in writing&quot; (about such observation, I would say that it is compliment, for  writing  as speaking is the best way to engage a reader. Reading an essay about a tale should be just like the tale was intended to be delivered: spoken.I would appreciate comments on my points above.Here is the essay:What is the meaning  of  life?  Many find none at all. Such a dry perspective is based on the reductionist view that all is matter. Consequently,  one is not able to see beyond the materiality that surrounds oneself. The tale of  Hans in Luck  discusses such a tense binary: meaning-life. Besides, a secondary binary element deals with another tension, which is found in the structures of social life. On one hand we have voluntary association, on the other, familial ties. Indeed, structures that can easily become conflicting. Such a sub-tension will underpin how the character will ultimately decide what is meaningful for himself.   The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what will shape our existence.  Thus, as soon as one thing becomes a burden, it should be discarded. Successively, Hans trades his seven year salary, which is fully materialized into a single piece of gold    as big as his head       would his mind initially set on the shine or worth of wealth?    for horse, then horse for cow, cow for pig, pig for goose, goose for grindstone    apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?    Finally, when near water, he accidently let the grindstone fall in the water; it sinks; it is gone. Surprisingly, instead of desperation for losing his seven year payment    initially shining and finally opaque   , Hans is very glad because he has nothing else that would hinder his journey   s progress; definitely, there are greater values in life than being attached to material things. For Hans, nothing is more precious than arriving at his mother&apos;s home; nothing is more valuable than the company of the one he loves and loves him.  Moral lesson: Utility is what we attach to things, but only the inutility of love can give us meaning  in  life.Overall evaluation/feedbackNote: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.To review how to approach evaluating this assignment, please revisit the section on &quot;Peer Evaluation&quot; on the &quot;Work Expectations&quot; page and two video clips in Unit 00 - Getting Started, &quot;How to Read for this Course&quot; and &quot;How to Write for this Course.&quot;  Please indicate in 30-150 words your judgment of the FORM of the essay you have just read.   FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure.  Are the sentences grammatically correct?   Are the words properly used?   Is the exposition and argument laid out clearly?

Well structure and point put forward in a concise way. Well done!!peer 2      Grammar? good. Words properly used? Yes especially inutility, i thought the use of that word was clever. The exposition and argument was a little confusing at first but after a second reading i managed to attain your gist.peer 3      Clear structure and correct grammar use. Essay consists of the opening statement, main expositive body and conclusion.peer 4      The sentences are mostly grammatically correct. However, the writing seems to be more spoken than written. Also, the words are too fancy and redundant. Also, there are too many rhetorical questions than necessary. In conclusion, the writing is altogether too confusing and disengaging. Therefore, although the ideas are individually good and interesting, they are all over the place when put together.  Please grade the FORM of the essay you have just read on a scale of 1 to 3. FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure.  Are the sentences grammatically correct? Are the words properly used? Is the exposition and argument laid out clearly? An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.Since everyone can learn to write better, at least 10% but no more than 30% of the grades should be 1. Everyone should strive for perfect grammar. However, if someone writes in ways that are particularly vivid or uses particularly incisive key terms to focus the argument or in some other way is outstanding in usage or structure, that essay should be awarded a 3 but no more than 20% of the grades should be a 3 because, by definition, &quot;outstanding&quot; is comparatively rare. Most grades should be 2.Score from your peers:  2Please indicate in 30-150 words your judgment of the CONTENT of the essay you have just read. CONTENT here refers to matters of insight, argument, and example.  Does the essay show a deep understanding of some aspect of the work or of a pattern that one can see in the work? Does the argument make sense, feel persuasive, and reveal the significance of the insight or insights? Are there concrete details from the text that support the argument and that we come to understand more powerfully because of the argument? An ideal response would note one aspect of Content that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Content that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.peer 1      The argument of your essay makes completely sense and I entirely agree with it. There were lots of discussions in the forum about this tale and different opinions, but I think you have summarized quite well the real meaning of it.peer 2      Your content is fantastic, you really understand the motives and longings of Hans and his quest to find happiness. I especially loved the sentence at the end of your first paragraph about the sub-tension (ohhhh that lovely word choice) of the relationships Hans has at the beginning of the tale. The way you elegantly placed it at the end of the first paragraph solidifies the thought in my mind as I read the second part. The only thing i would add (and it is a small thing at that) is something about the loss of wealth with each successive trade Hans does (horse is worth more than cow, cow is worth more than pig ect ect)peer 3      Well done story description and argumentation of thoughts. It would be preferably to use some external source for deeper analysis and comparison with other tales.peer 4      &quot;What is the meaning of life? Many find none at all.&quot; This immediately caught my attention. Also, the writer has written interesting and reasonable insights that I agree upon such as: &quot;The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what can ultimately shape our existence.&quot; However, the supporting examples are too weak and confusing. For example, there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer&apos;s argument, such as: &quot;...would his mind initially set on the shine or &quot;worth&quot; of wealth?&quot; and &quot;apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?&quot; The writing would be much better in content, if the writer simply stated his/her point and given a quote/example from the story.

Then, try reading it to yourself, and think if a 3 year old could understand it. Also, try not to write as you speak, but follow the grammatical rules in writing. When this is done, you can add on the meat of jotting down direct examples from the story that go along with your points. If you want to go further, try to playing with your words and &quot;woo&quot; the reader.                                                  ;HI,Just clarifying and discussing a little further. Probably you don&apos;t see a tension between life and meaning, but I do. The tension is life on one side and meaning/full/less on other side. The tension is between two concepts: life and meaning. Also, there is a binary as well when I talk about voluntary association and family ties. According to the American English dictionary binary is &quot;consisting  of,  indicating,  or  involving  two.&quot; The tension here involved is: will Hans give more value to voluntary association or family ties? Whenever one has to decide between two sides, then there is tension.The point you most disagree is about finding a moral on the tale. Your disagreement is based on a fallacious argument called  argumentum ad auctoritatem, that is, the professor says..., so it has to be like this. Actually, I do not agree with most of the Freudian hermeneutic adopted by professor Rabkin. Indeed, I respect his authority and appreciate very much his thoughtful insight. However, since his reading into the text and not from the text, I might agree or not. I agree that there is no moral to be found in every tale, but we can find in some of them. Barthes said that once the author releases his text, s/he is not the owner of it anymore; the author is dead; the reader can comprehend the text in a total different way. It is up to the reader to find or not if something (moral or no moral) is present in a text.Well. There is more, but it is enough. I believe that such a peer evaluation will be the burdensome of this course. Mainly because it is given too much power for a so diverse group made up of different views and level of education and knowledge about the subject.Best regards,Rosevarte;</string>
            <string>I just heard the Phantom Tollbooth mentioned today.   I&apos;m going to take it as a sign that I must read it!;</string>
            <string>Thank you to the reviewers who were nice enough to give me 6 :) I now recognise some things that were unclear, inaccurate or could be improved on, but here is the essay as I submitted it:  &quot;The nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford once said a scientific discovery has no merit unless it can be explained to a barmaid. In other words, an expert must understand his subject with such clarity as to be able to explain it in the simplest terms to a layman. Lewis Carroll took his technical understanding a step further     he translated his mathematical knowledge into a story for children, who are laypeople where everything is concerned.  The original story Carroll told the Liddell children (Alice   s Adventures Under Ground) lacked several iconic characters such as the Mad Hatter, March Hare, Cheshire Cat and the pig-baby. They found their way into the published version as mathematical allusions. Stubbornly conservative, Carroll was unhappy with the radical mathematics of his time such as symbolic algebra, projective geometry and imaginary numbers, which he felt were not sufficiently grounded in reality. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland satirizes these strange ideas in its most famous scenes. The most illuminating example of this is the Mad Tea-Party, where without the crucial element of Time, the three characters (or three terms of a    quaternion   ) rotate endlessly around the tea-table (or a plane). This is a reference to William Hamilton   s Quaternions, which could describe three-dimensional motion instead of motion in a plane.  When a book or story continues to resonate with its readers decades or centuries after it is published, it is often said of it that it contains    universal themes   . People still want to marry into rich families, just as they did in Elizabeth Bennett   s time, and still want legal redress for their problems, as they did when The Merchant of Venice was written. Lewis Carroll on the other hand, resonates with his modern readers not through his depiction of love or jealousy or justice, but because he could transform abstract technical concepts into enchanting characters and vividly ludicrous conversation. That is something no other technical expert has ever done so successfully.&quot;  I would work on the continuity between paragraphs 2 and 3 and work out the connection between the Rutherford quote and what I have said about Carroll following that in paragraph 1 to improve it. I made an oversight and did not quote this video that helped me to write the essay, which should have come under citations:  http://riaus.org.au/events/alice-in-wonderland/Does anybody have any other suggestions?  ;Thank you so much! :);I agree with most of the above posts - science and faith mesh together in an interesting way in Van Helsing&apos;s character.   I would like to add that I did notice a few potentially mistaken bits of science. Quincey Morris narrates an anecdote where a horse of his was drained dry of blood in a single night by a vampire bat, which is really impossible. A single bat only consumes 1 fluid ounce of blood during a feeding, and while the wound bleeds for a while due to the anticoagulant in the saliva, that surely isn&apos;t enough to kill a horse. And I found it astonishing that Lucy could receive a transfusion of blood from four different people and not develop an adverse reaction. The only explanation is that she had AB +ve blood, which is one of the rarest of all blood types. Dracula was published only 3 years before Karl Landsteiner discovered blood typing, but I was disappointed when Dr. Van Helsing did not even pay lip service to the very likely event that the transfusions themselves might kill her. Surely he must have seen anaphylaxis after transfusions before, being a surgeon and all!  ;</string>
            <string>Thanks so much! :)  ;This is one of those occasions where the negative aspect of diversity shows itself. Everybody has their own idea of what constitutes a good essay which may only be loosely based on the guidelines given in the work requirements. I have always thought that outside references made a work look more &quot;scholarly&quot; and well-researched. It means the writer was able to illustrate his idea better with a quote, or spot a connection between someone else&apos;s work and the novel in question, so if I were grading your essays I would give you more points for that! Thank you for you kind words :);I especially liked the way you drew a comparison between Dracula and Van Helsing, who are both foreigners, and their opposing roles in the story. What a great essay!  ;I am stunned, this is the second 6 I&apos;ve got! At the risk of sounding as though I am blowing my own trumpet too much, here is my Dracula essay:  There are many blood-drinking animals in the world, but I believe Dracula goes a long way in illuminating why the vampire alone frightens us so much.   If the vampire simply preyed upon humans the way leeches and bedbugs do, Van Helsing might have simply struck a deal with Dracula to provide him with a steady supply of donated blood. Instead of simply preying on them, the Count converts human into creatures like himself. This might possibly be where the root of our fear of Dracula comes from     his ability to convert rational man into a    lower   , more beastly creature, distorting him and corrupting him.  On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, in Stoker   s lifetime, and polarized attitudes towards the apes, writes Richard Dawkins, in his book The Ancestor   s Tale.    Apes were animals, we were set apart   _ where other animals, such as cats or deer, could be seen as beautiful in their own way, gorillas and other apes, precisely because of their similarity to ourselves, seemed like caricatures, distortions, grotesques.    Dracula, noticeably, has changed so little in his physical appearance, despite the enormous change in his physiology and the physical abilities, he can easily pass for a human. His human origins are still very visible, and brought forcibly home by the way Mina Harker pities Dracula the human being (p.305). Count Dracula is a hellish distortion of a human being, and the characters are in mortal fear that they too shall be distorted by him.   Human beings value many things about our species     our sense of morality, our sense of social obligation to each other, our ability to mature (Dracula   s    child-brain    is contrasted repeatedly with the protagonists       man-brains   ), our ability to die, and our supposed ability to go to Heaven and be with God. Dracula takes each of these values and corrupts them, while still looking, talking and behaving like an ordinary human man, so that the distortion is all the more apparent.   Dracula shows us how much we value these qualities in ourselves, and so gives us a powerful insight into human nature.  One of my peer reviewers mentioned in the comments that they were just about to start reading The Ancestor&apos;s Tale, and to them I would say go for it, it&apos;s a fantastic book!  ;I usually look for three things in particular:  1. A thesis, or a point towards which the essay is geared.2. This thesis would have to have an element of inference or analysis in it. For example, I would cut points for a thesis like &quot;Dracula is a scary character.&quot; The writer can maybe use that as a starting point for a discussion about Dracula drinking blood, equating blood with life, and that is why draining the blood, or life, out of someone is scary.  3. Sufficient examples quoted to back up any claims made, or opinions stated. For example, if someone is saying that Mina Harker is a more empowered woman than Lucy Westenra, they must back that up by quoting something from the book, maybe that Mina earns her own living and controls her own income (at least before she marries) whereas Lucy does not work.  I tried to choose these criteria based on the work requirements.  I&apos;m not sure what a &quot;casual&quot; essay is. For my part I write the essay as though I am addressing a teacher of mine, with whom I have a friendly relationship and a good rapport - fairly straightforward wording but no slang or abbreviations, and with proper grammar.I hope these criteria are alright; if anyone has an improvement to suggest on these I would be glad to hear it!   ;Professor Rabkin is not the teacher I think of when writing because i don&apos;t have a friendly relationship with him :) Being open and vivid is a good idea, I think, but I&apos;ve seen a few essays that were TOO open and conversational, as though the writer were chatting to you over coffee or something. I think that should be avoided.  ;That&apos;s a great criterion: re-reading the book with a new interpretation that changes your understanding of it. I think I will pay more attention to that!  ;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>One of the essays that was submitted to me appeared to be based on article called  The Usual Suspect: Edgar Allan Poe, Consulting Detective  by Arthur Krystal. I could not find a free, accessible version of this article online, so I could not be sure how much of the essay was drawn from the article. There are multiple references to this article, which gave the general impression that the essay was somewhat like a summary of the article. I was unsure as to how to evaluate this essay, as I could not tell how much original thought went into it, and I did not submit my evaluation. Can someone tell me the correct way to deal with something like this?;</string>
            <string>Here&apos;s my &apos;6&apos;:Renfield&apos;s obsession with eating flies is one of the least understood aspects of Stoker&apos;s Dracula. In his original notes, Stoker called Renfield    Flyman   [1], yet in the novel he disguised the significance of the flies by never stating explicitly why Renfield started to devour them. Thus, when Seward wrote that Renfield was a &apos;zoophagous maniac&apos; in eating live animals[2], he misunderstood the nature of his patient&apos;s deeper intent.Two types of flies can be identified in the book. The first were the common houseflies which Renfield baited with sugar, stored in boxes and ate compulsively. Ingesting these houseflies, symbols of evil, bearers of pestilence and objects of disgust, was believed by Renfield to give him longevity. According to Seward, the eating of flies &apos;was life, strong life, and gave life to him&apos;. There are obvious parallels here to Dracula with his drinking of blood. When disallowed from eating flies, Renfield ate spiders, and, when forbidden from spiders, sparrows, not because he wanted live flesh, but because the flies were inside them.  More tellingly, the second kind of flies that Renfield consumed were blowflies.   A particularly disturbing scene depicts Renfield eating a blowfly &apos;bloated with some carrion food&apos;. Blowflies, which usually feed on rotting flesh, are symbols of death stalking a person. A sense of putrefaction is prevalent throughout the novel, such as when Hawker noted that Dracula &apos;is surrounded by the smell of decay&apos;. Significantly, it was Dracula who had been supplying Renfield with blowflies, the patient confessing near the end of his life that &apos;he used to send in the flies...great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings&apos;. Dracula, who was able to control Renfield in this way, can therefore be seen as personifying the Lord of the Flies, a translation of the biblical Beelzebub, more commonly known as the Prince of Demons or the Devil [3].  [1] Eighteen-Bisang, R. &amp; Miller, E. (2008)  Bram Stoker&apos;s Notes for Dracula,  Jefferson: McFarland p.319[2] The term &apos;zoophagous&apos;, coined in 1835 by W. Kirby in his  On Power of God in Creation of Animals  (p.70), means animal eater. It fell out of use in 1840 when it was felt &apos;carnivore&apos; was more suitable. Stoker resurrected the word to invent his disorder for Renfield. Today, &apos;zoophagia&apos; is used to describe stage two of a psychological disorder called clinical vampirism, also know as &apos;Renfield&apos;s Syndrome&apos;.[3] Jeffrey, D.L. (ed.) (1992)  Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature,  Grand Rapids: Eerdmans p.80;Haha. I thought I would get that comment. It was me in the last session who wrote the essay, but I couldn&apos;t finish it, so I am redoing the course. Maybe self-plagiarism, but I was rather proud of this essay.Are you redoing the course too?;That&apos;s OK. I had the problem of one of my young daughter&apos;s hitting the keyboard when I was at work and unenrolling by mistake. It was too late to reenroll, so I thought I&apos;d try again, but using a few of the essays from before. I have also tackled some anew, as I am doing this week with Frankenstein.I did find in interesting that for my first essay on the Grimm Brothers (about the symbolism of hazel trees), last time I got 5.5 yet this time I got 4.5. I guess it&apos;s all about the luck of the draw.I have to say that out of the 30+ online courses I have done, this is one of my favourites. I&apos;ll probably end up doing it again in the future, trying to write all essays from a total new angle - I&apos;m tempted to combine the knowledge from this course with the one on  Kierkegaard to produce 10 totally off-the-wall essays.;I just came across this on twitter...for anyone interested in a MOOC on linguistics, one has recently been posted, starting this fall. It is from the University of Marburg, one of Germany&apos;s oldest universities.There are three levelshttp://linguistics.online.uni-marburg.de/welcome.php;</string>
            <string>I like the one from 2 July for  Wis  awa Szymborska.

As you can see, I am one of these...This is one of my favourite courses so far, but I&apos;ve done a lot of other great ones too. Here are some of my top recommendations from the many I have done or am currently doing...At coursera-Global History since 1760 is a great survey of the world in modern times. The last couple of weeks of lectures are fantastic, perhaps as Philip Zelikow has lived through so much of it - he was the director of the 9/11 Commission.-Think Again was the first course I did. It was fun and quite challenging, especially with the truth tables.-Intro to US Food Systems is really enlightening. The lectures really had me hooked. It was also quite disturbing.-Introduction to Philosophy is fun, but not deep enough...-Language of Hollywood is great fun. Really good lectures and included many films that I hadn&apos;t seen before.-Know Thyself. Again fantastic lectures and a lot of good reading.-How Things Work 1. Good for non-scientists like me and my young daughters loved watching the zany lectures too.-The Ancient Greeks. Professor &apos;Andy&apos; makes teaching seem so easy. I&apos;m jealous. Really interesting class.-Climate Literacy. Good discussions and by far the most active forum I&apos;ve seen here. A lot of very knowledgeable people are taking this class.-Archeology&apos;s Dirty Little Secrets. A unique professor (in a good way) and interesting subject matter.at edx-Justice-Human Health and Global Environmental Change. As can be expected from Harvard, both great courses, although the forums on edx are not good.at open2study-Being Human. Quite basic, but a good intro to evolution.at uwa-Ocean Solutions. In-depth study on the present state of our seas.at saylor-Ancient Civilizations. A lot of reading and no lectures, but I learnt a lot from this one.;</string>
            <string>The scoring on this course seems much tougher than on its last outing. As I&apos;ve mentioned elsewhere, I couldn&apos;t finish last time, so am repeating the course. This is one of the essays I&apos;ve used again. Last time I got 5.5 for this essay. This time I have got 4. I guess this shows we should take the grade with a pinch of salt.-----The police presence in &apos;The Tell-Tale Heart&apos; and &apos;The Black Cat&apos; was crucial to the psychological states of both protagonists and to the stories&apos; endings. Poe&apos;s use of the police brought a new element to fantasy as he was one of the first writers to give them a role in fiction[1].In &apos;The Tell-Tale Heart&apos;, Poe depicted three policemen sitting around cheerfully whilst the murderer had a mental breakdown brought on by what he thought were their &apos;hypocritical smiles&apos;. Initially he had believed &apos;my  manner  had convinced them&apos; that nothing was amiss. However, the longer the police stayed, the more anxious he became: &apos;They heard! - they suspected! - they  knew!&apos;. Thus, even though the police were unaware that a crime had been committed, his paranoia made him admit his guilt. This reaction is significant in that it showed for the first time in fiction what a person&apos;s reaction could be when confronted by the idea of this newly established body of authority[2].In &apos;The Black Cat&apos; the police played a similar role as, even though they partook in a &apos;rigorous investigation&apos; of the premises, the murderer felt secure that his crime would go undetected. He related that &apos;their assurance of my guiltlessness&apos; meant that they suspected nothing. This false sense of bravado proved his undoing. Again, the presence of the police was key to the story. After the black cat&apos;s scream, Poe gave his only physical description of the police, writing of &apos;a dozen stout arms toiling&apos; to knock down the wall, implying the firmness of this new force.Without the police, both stories would have had incomplete endings. Poe&apos;s inclusion of the police brought a new dimension to fiction in that their arrival could bring closure to a story. In doing so, the police became an obvious symbol of authority. For the reader, this also had the significant effect of creating a greater consciousness of what it meant to be policed.[1] Poe was also responsible for what is considered to be the first detective story, &apos;The Murders on the Rue Morgue&apos; (1841). See Flanders, J. (2011)  The Invention of Murder  p.294[2] Both these stories were written in Philadelphia and were published in 1843. However, the police in Philadelphia were established in 1845. It seems he may have been influenced by a stay in Richmond, Virginia where a police force had been established some years earlier. For Philadelphia seehttp://www.seventy.org/Downloads/Policy_&amp;_Reform/Governance_Studies/1998_Police_Governance_Study.pdf.For Richmond see  http://www.richmondgov.com/Police/HistoryPoliceDepartment.aspxFORM (2)peer 1      Good structure of the text with a clear introduction and conclusion. The thesis was well written and I like your exposition. Overall grammar was very good and words properly used.peer 2      Overall a well written essay with grammar, spelling and usage well done. You have a run-on sentence (the first sentence of the third paragraph needs to be broken into two or possibly three sentences.) Note that run-on sentences, in addition to being grammatically incorrect, tend to loose their meaning by virtue of their rambling.peer 3      &quot;The police presence in &apos;The Tell-Tale Heart&apos; and &apos;The Black Cat&apos; was crucial to the psychological states of both protagonists and to the stories&apos; endings.

The essay has a very clear exposition. Great job!peer 4      Nice grammar.Concise and clean opening paragraph, solid conclusion .Well done.peer 5      Smoothly written. Well structured. I have no suggestions, except keep it up :-)peer 6      The sentences are grammaticaly correct and the words are properly used. I noted that when you cited the books you used simple quotation and I think it is preferable to use italic, but I am not going to evaluate that as it might be the other way around where you live.CONTENT (2)peer 1      The topic is interesting and I like the way you analyze the role of police in both stories. The essay is easy to follow and the examples you provided are accurate and insightful. It is an interesting essay to read, thanks!peer 2      I enjoyed your discussion of the role of the police officer in the two short stories you discussed. Highlighting this element has definitely affected the way I see the tales in retrospect and will assuredly affect how I watch police dramas in the future :-)peer 3      I agree with your idea about the sane polices. They did take an important part of the two stories. I really liked this sentence: &quot;This false sense of bravado proved his undoing.&quot; Deep!peer 4      Great job explaining the significance of your insight.peer 5      You pick out a specific detail (the presence of police) in two stories and convincingly detail its import as a catalyst for the climax and denoument of the stories. It&apos;s a detail that would go underappreciated if not for your essay; thus, your essay absolutely enriches a reader&apos;s reading! Plus, you end with a very potent implication: Poe introducing the idea of what it means to be policed.  COMMENTSpeer 5      Wow :-)peer 6      Poe really inspired many authors, such as Arthur Conan Doyle and his famous detective. Good work!;</string>
            <string>Love your sense of humour Lauren!;Hi Suzanne, I too was shocked  when reading Grimm&apos;s  stories; not so much  with the stories themselves but my reaction to them. Reading the stories I realised I had read most of them as a child, but like your daughter, I never saw anything dark in them the first time around. Reading them again now, years later, with the specific intent of reading for hidden meanings and symbolism I see a very dark side to the stories that I never picked up on as a child. So my &quot;shock&quot;, was actually surprise that I didn&apos;t  &quot;see&quot; any of this darkness the first time around. Oh to be an innocent child again.Offended? No. This realisation led me to questions such as: what type of lives did people live that led them to make up these stories? In what context did parents tell their children these stories? What can we learn about life back them from reading these stories? Were they insignificant, incidental stories,  or a major part of child rearing practices back in the day?So my advice, don&apos;t stare at the darkness but become a detective! It sounds like this course will be a great learning opportunity for you, for you to look inwards and learn about yourself and what makes you tick. If you learn a bit about literature and writing along the way that would be a bonus.PS I&apos;m new to all this and definitely no expert, so feel free to take my advice with a grain of salt (pardon the clich  )cheers;</string>
            <string>What is nearer to ten than ten?...;</string>
            <string>I wonder about the marking practices of some peers in this course.   One peer gave me 1s on the accusation that my essay was plagiarised!   Here is the comment:peer 3      This is a perfect essay. Given the reference cited below, it seems likely that the author simply copied the essay from the reference. I wish I could think otherwise but I cannot. Awarding ones on this basis.While I am flattered that the person believes my essay is &apos;perfect&apos; (I wouldn&apos;t agree here), I am quite offended about this accusation as it has no basis.   If it helps contextually, I am a high school English teacher; I would hope that my writing of essays is in some way effective.   I will copy and paste my essay for reference.   By the way, the works cited reference was for my Hemingway quote.My plea is this: please assess peers on the basis of what you see, not conjecture.   Students on this course put a lot of time into reading, thinking and writing essays so it is only fair that the same level of consideration be given when you are assessing a work as well.My essay:                 Grimm   s fairytales give us greater insight into human behavior and choices.   Despite the profusion of fantastical elements, such as animorphism, personification of the natural world, magic, and so on, the reader easily suspends disbelief by empathizing with characters.   We can immediately relate to the desires of the characters, and wring our hands at their misfortune brought on by poor decisions.   This suspension of disbelief and empathy is created in spite of the potent natural symbolism and fantastic elements, which in turn creates the timelessness and universal appeal of the stories.    The desires of the characters are the most striking feature and immediately create empathy.   Humble desires and actions help us respect people like the fisherman, as opposed to the insatiable greed of his wife in    The Fisherman and his Wife   .   The cheeky mischief of Tom Thumb makes us laugh, while the broken promises and betrayals (   Cat and Mouse in Partnership   ,    How Mrs Fox Married Again   ) make us cringe and acknowledge unethical actions.   Universal understandings of ethical behaviour are what help give these stories their timeless and universal appeal.  Natural symbolism is another prominent feature that immediately helps us relate to key meanings in the text.   Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.  Hemingway once remarked,    All good books have one thing in common     they are truer than if they had really happened.      This is especially true in the case of these fairytales.   Universal truths about ethical behaviour are encoded within, and the natural symbolism and fantastic elements fascinate our minds and help us engage with these truths in more memorable ways.;</string>
            <string>Same thing happened to me.   They said they ran it through a &quot;plagiarism checker&quot; and I had copied 3 lines word for word, well I ran it through a &quot;plagiarism checker&quot; and it found nothing!   It&apos;s just really irritating for someone to say that and if I use internet resources I do credit them.;</string>
            <string>Is such an accusation really a big deal on a course like this?I ask because I assume (perhaps incorrectly) that most of us are here only to learn, certification be damned. If this is the case then it should be easy to detach the accusation from the compliment - after all, you know the truth of it.;I agree, it is the mindset that makes it a big deal - Andrew has demonstrated he has no such mindset. The issue is not whether plagiarism is a big deal (I think all would agree it is), but whether accusations by fellow students of plagiarism is a big deal.I will give the peer reviewer the benefit of the doubt and assume they genuinely thought an instance of plagiarism had occurred. They should not be ashamed of themselves to make such a mistake, but take the opportunity to learn from it.  And we should not deter fellow students from making similar accusations. As we are agreed plagiarism is a serious issue, but finding it requires some skill. What better place to learn this skill? If it happens again (as likely it will) people should follow Andrew&apos;s good example and ask the community for consensus.;The OP says she couldn&apos;t write a cohesive essay on the Brothers Grimm, but it seems she has just done a reasonable job.I was never brought up on these stories, even the Disney versions, but for a long time I thought the Brothers Grim was a literal description of the stories - grim. Therefore, I see the stories not nearly as dark as i thought they would be.I wonder, does the OP find cartoon violence as offensive? Tom and Jerry is very violent, but being a cartoon, and so somehow removed from reality, the violence is muted.I agree with everyone else though regarding the value of the tales in the course. Will you fare any better with Dracula, more horrific perhaps, but as it is supposed to be horrific maybe it will be more palatable than finding horror in &apos;children tales&apos;?;Forgot to ask: like cartoon violence, do people see the violence of fairytales as somehow unreal?;Just finished the second essay (but my first). I&apos;m a little concerned though that I&apos;m reading things in the book that simply aren&apos;t there.How can one tell the difference between a theme or feature that the author intended and just something I&apos;ve interpreted in the light of my own biases?;But language is so loaded with multiple meanings it is hard to say something that could not be taken to mean something else, intention be damned.I&apos;m coming to this course from the sciences too. I think a different mindset is required.;</string>
            <string>Vampirism has been explored via Christian mythology, why not Buddhist? Buddhism, particularly Tibetan, has much to say on the theme of death.;</string>
            <string>Paying for it does change the issue. If it was not well displayed that the method of marking is peer review then you have good grounds to seek compensation if you feel aggrieved.  ;I hope the above two posts are jokes.If the &apos;they&apos; which are referred to were black people or women there would outrage at such comments. Why do expect any less outrage from working class people?;This went strangely off-topic so didn&apos;t notice the reply.When someone starts describing the world in terms of &apos;us&apos; and &apos;them&apos;, I find it hard to feel charitable. It was an interesting OP, and I certainly wouldn&apos;t want to discourage discussion on the topic. But such remarks that followed, even if tongue-in-cheek, only serve to reinforce negative stereotypes. The trouble is, when repeated often enough, people start believing them.;I don&apos;t understand the first sentence, could you elaborate?Try a different perspective. Let us pretend that the comment, &apos;They are motivated chiefly by money, and (interestingly) drink...&apos; was made in reference to black people. If that&apos;s what the book says, fine. But then to say: &apos;  and things have changed in modern day Britain for black people ...how&apos;Followed by : &apos;Oh, they work less these days.&apos;Can you see how that would be taken to be racist, even if meant only in jest? So my question would be why would it be unacceptable to say such about black people, but acceptable to say it about working class, or any other group of people?Given the tone of your reply I&apos;ve obviously annoyed you, which wasn&apos;t my intention. I only  wanted  to explain why I read the   first interpretation you offered, not the other two.;I&apos;m aware I come across as patronising sometimes, esp. on forums. It&apos;s something I&apos;m working on as I don&apos;t mean to do so. An English lit. class is a pretty good place to learn how to better express myself though. Sorry for derailing your thread, but given  I interpreted your response the way I did, you can understand my reaction. I&apos;ll try to lighten up.  That link doesn&apos;t work.;Why from a scientific point of view would he have no right? Science is silent on the issue of morality. Unless you are thinking that an experiment could be devised to prove some legal point?;I broadly agree with your points, but disagree on a technical issue. Science is a process of testing hypotheses. Being a process, it is silent on morality. However, being that it is ultimately a human process, no matter how much we try to remove the observer, we bring ethics into our science. We could decide not to, and we would still have science.Interesting you mention maths. I learnt recently that one of the motivations for Plato to study maths was that he hoped by doing so he would gain a better understanding of ethics.;</string>
            <string>I think there was also a function for the person being evaluated to give feedback on the peer reviews received. It would be helpful to have a communication channel between the person being evaluated and those who reviewed the work, for clarification if necessary.   ;</string>

            <string>The novel consists of rants from the dramatic yet scientific Victor Frankenstein as well as those from his creation, the monster.   I found it difficult to read in the beginning but persisted till the end.   People seem to judge the book based on its writer, namely a 18 year &quot;kid&quot; and &quot;girl&quot; as frequently mentioned.   Seems like the prejudices of people from Mary Shelley&apos;s time remain till today.   Despite the criticisms, fact is that the idea of Frankenstein&apos;s monster lasted for 2 centuries and will remain.   This is an achievement in itself.;sex and immortality seem to be recurring topics from the first unit till now, as discussed in the lectures.   either they are conventional ways to analyse literature or both topics are very much in the minds of people.   that said, we should not be so narrow-minded as to exclude other perspectives which each of us bring; or worse, conclude that perspectives other than the conventional ones are not as &quot;deep&quot; or insightful.   fiction is a work of art.   the interpretation of art is subjective and very much dependent on one&apos;s personal experience and wisdom.      ;</string>
            <string>There&apos;s also the opposite end of the spectrum, I was marked down by two reviewers for citing quotations.  ;</string>
            <string>The issue is everyone has a different view on what the grading criteria is. It is laid out, but there seems to be multiple interpretations floating around between different students. This makes it hard to have a consistant grading scale.  ;This is my first class with Coursera that I have been able to stick to. I tried one other one, but it started during midterms so I ended up droping it. I love the free classes, they are a nice break from the required courses I have to take for my degree. Other than a few people it seems to be a very good community. At least it seems like the reviewers are getting nicer.;It is actually possible. I know in my college classes, if you quote or reference your past work you have to cite it. If you don&apos;t, then it is still considered plagerism. This suprised me too when I first heard it. But it is because you are still refering to you own work as a source, so it has to be treated the same as any other source. This might not be the same as what you were accused of, but it may have been what they were thinking.  ;I was not saying it did, I was just explaining how it is possible to plagerize yourself in some settings.  ;What are you being graded down on? I am just curious so that I can understand what you are saying. I do not want to accidently make the same mistakes you have encountered in the future.  ;There is a difference, my question as to understand what was occuring in order to keep a more open mind. Spelling differences and things like that, to me, are understandable and would not be marked down. However, without some sort of explanation as to what is occuring, there is no way for me to fully understand what the issue is.  ;It is, however this course is done through an American college and people are grading based on their understanding. It is dificult to know who lives where, especially since it is a global class. Someone may see you writing grey (which I have a habit of doing too) and think it was a typo without knowing any different. But there is no need to insult people. It is not constructive and the negativity takes away from your argument.  ;</string>

            <string>I understand is a part of the assigment to mark the grammar and the spelling mistakes, but some people seem too rude to me. It&apos;s obviously much more difficult for a non speaker to express themselves in another lenguage. No need to be rude, or insult someone who basically spent more time than you trying to write in a foreign lenguage.Also, I find it quite nonsense to mark again the essay for its grammar in the second part.  I always try to be generous with others marks, but I think some people do the other way, and I do not find it fair.;I agree that is a part of the methodology, the grammar and the structure, and I understand to not be given a high mark if I don&apos;t do it quite well. But I found insulting some of the reviews given by some peers. Like if I haven&apos;t review my work, or if I did not try to express myself in the best of the ways.I just don&apos;t like people looking down on me because I do not speak their lenguage as well as then. Also I would like to ask that, please, tell the person the mistakes they have made! I cannot improve my work if I don&apos;t know what are the error I made.Thanks so much, anyway. =);</string>

            <string>I think it&apos;s unfair to put Tom and Jerry in the same argument as the Grimm tales or any of the works we will be studying in this course. I hate Tom and Jerry personally because to me it is a series of rather violent but completely meaningless and mindless actions. It&apos;s gratuitous violence at its best, even if it is a cartoon and even if it&apos;s meant to be funny, it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. However I have no issue with the Grimm tales, or Dracula or Poe or any of the other works we are going to study.  There is violence in quite a lot of fantasy and science fiction stories, but it&apos;s important to consider why that violence is there in the first place. All the works we are studying are not mindless slasher novels but absolute literary classics that have withstood the test of time - therefore there has to be value in the violence within them.  Fantasy and Science Fiction often simply holds up a mirror to our society, and in showing us these alternate worlds it tells us a lot about the way things are in our world. At the time of the Brothers Grimm violence and extreme corporal punishments were very much a part of life. Even now, we live in a society that contains a significant amount of violence, and so it&apos;s only natural that this violence is reflected in works of arts and in literature.If the violence offends the OP or anyone else then that is probably a good place to start the analysis of the piece. We have the freedom to analyse any of these pieces on the grounds that we choose and what better place to start than with something to which you have a strong reaction to. What role does the violence play in the story? Why is it there? What does it tell us about the character, the authors, what does it tell us about society at the time, or even now? All the writers we are studying are literary masters and there will have been a reason for them inserting violence into their stories. Before dismissing any of these stories for their violence surely we first need to understand why it&apos;s there in the first place.   (by the way, I haven&apos;t read all the way to the bottom of the thread, I wanted to comment on this particular bit - sorry if this has all already been said below!);I&apos;m doing my essay on another topic and since we can only submit one short essay I won&apos;t get the chance to discuss this so I thought I&apos;d mention it here.  When Alice encounters the Red King sleeping, Tweedledee tells her he is dreaming of her. This reminded me of  Zhuangzi&apos;s question: &quot;Am I a man dreaming he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he is a man?&quot; after waking up from a vivid dream where he was a butterfly and was not aware of himself as a man.  Having the Red King asleep and dreaming of Alice in the Looking Glass world begs the question: is Alice dreaming of herself in Looking Glass world meeting the sleeping Red King, or is the Red King dreaming of Alice dreaming of being in Looking Glass world? In which case when she wakes up is it truly reality or still an extension of the Red King&apos;s dream?  Or are they like two mirrors face to face: Alice dreams of being in Looking Glass world meeting the Red King who&apos;s dreaming of Alice dreaming she is in   Looking Glass world   meeting the Red King....ad infinitum.  ;</string>

            <string>I like your thesis Laurie, it&apos;s interesting and a different point of view to the other essays I&apos;ve read so far. I don&apos;t think your essay deserved the low score you say it received as I enjoyed it, but I know it&apos;s a bit frustrating when you don&apos;t have constructive feedback on what to improve so here&apos;s my two cents, hope it helps.I agree with your point for the second part or so of the novel, but in the first part the reader gets to read all the journals, letters etc, before the characters think about pooling them together. That is in part what creates such suspense because we already understand what is happening before the characters really get a grasp on the situation. That&apos;s my opinion anyway. Then as you say the characters then start to pool their writings together, they become very aware that all they write will be read (which as you say is quite ironic), and of the importance of learning from the records they create.  I think there might be a bit of lack of structure in your essay, it probably would have help to have a concluding paragraph or sentence to help tighten it all up. There is something about your essay that for me doesn&apos;t flow as well as it could, but I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m struggling to put my finger on what that is. I think it might be the need for a little more structure. Maybe someone will have better feedback on this than me.  I also found your second paragraph a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay which made it a bit confusing. I think if you took out that paragraph and maybe added a final concluding paragraph instead it would have worked a little better.  Hope this helps!;Hi Kasey,  I agree with Laurie&apos;s feedback. You start with a thesis about science vs superstition and throughout your essay you focus more on a Van Helsing = science + superstition idea. I think all you needed to do is to add in your introductory paragraph that the way Stoker illustrates his point about science vs superstition is to have Van Helsing representing the mix of the two.   I also think saying that Van Helsing knows that more than science is needed because he represents that bridge is maybe a little easy. He starts by using science but science fails him and so he turns to the darker and more powerful superstitions, as well as the religious iconography etc. In which case is he the bridge or does he represent a contrast between the two?With regards to form Laurie&apos;s done a great job there, so I won&apos;t go over what she said already. It&apos;s well written overall but there are a few things here and there that you could tighten which as Laurie points out would also probably reduce your word count. For example: &quot; In the end, it is not science that defeats Dracua, rather it is the religious iconography and superstitious practices that bring him down&quot; feels little clumsy to me. You could say &quot;In the end, it is not science but religious iconography and superstitious practices that defeat Dracula&quot;. That way you avoid the repetition in your original sentence.  Hope this helps!  ;Hi Florencia,  I just wanted to add a quick comment. I really like your idea that once Dracula&apos;s nature is understood and once his location is known he effectively loses his power and is defeated. That said, although your introduction and conclusion deal with this specifically, your middle two paragraphs deal with knowledge but in a different context. Maybe that&apos;s why two of your peers didn&apos;t find your thesis clear.  For me your essay makes a number of different points, all interesting but not all following the same thesis. The introductory and concluding paragraph deal with one thesis as I mention above. However, the second paragraph is pretty disconnected dealing with how much characters reveal to each other, whilst the third deals with the idea of class vs knowledge, science and superstition. Another very interesting point, and one that hadn&apos;t occurred to me - in fact I wish I&apos;d read an essay on that now, it would have been very interesting. I think if you had just focused on the class vs superstition point, or just on the fact that Dracula&apos;s power resides in the unknown and mysterious it would have been a big 3 from me.  Hope this helps!  ;Here&apos;s my essay. I got some lovely feedback - thank you very much to all my peers - but I&apos;d also love to hear what needs improving, or if there&apos;s anything lacking in my essay. Any criticisms welcome!  There is strong Christian imagery throughout Dracula, with Christian symbols and faith used as a defense and weapon against the vampires. However, Stocker also subverts Christian concepts such as the Eucharist for example, in having Mina forced to drink Dracula   s blood to    commune    with him. Renfield plays a particular role in perverting Christian ideas by making a God, or anti-God of Dracula.Just as John the Baptist announced the arrival of Christ, so Renfield announces the arrival of his master, paving the way for supreme being. In preparation, Renfield forgoes his comparatively frivolous and insignificant hobby - the flies and the spiders - instead swearing faithfulness to the higher power of Dracula. This is reminiscent of the preparation that a priest or monk might go through before taking orders. Renfield in effect becomes a disciple of Dracula, and Seward himself observes his patient is taken over by a religious mania.  There are also clues in Renfield   s speech. He refers to Dracula using the    He    and    His    customary when referring to God. He further likens himself to Enoch who in the Bible is said to have    walked with God: and he was not; for God took him&quot;, (Genesis 5:22-29). By doing this, Renfield likens Dracula to God and expresses his wish to be taken as Enoch was.Stoker uses the idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christ to add an unfinished note to the story. If Dracula is an anti-Christ there is a suggestion that he might resurrect and in fact, Mina (and therefore her unborn child) still has his blood inside her meaning that part of him lives on. We are left to wonder if the Crew of Light really have rid the world of vampires or whether they will rise again.  FORMpeer 1      Your essay is great. Your thesis is clear and you show some very good examples to support it. The form of your conclusion is rather unusual (but I love it anyway).peer 2      Beautifully written. Good work.peer 3      The form of this essay appears to be in very good condition. Spelling, grammar, and word usage work well with the points the author is trying to make. The author puts their ideas in an easily followed order. The ideas that are expressed are valid and documented correctly. I think this author should continue in the same manner.peer 4      The sentences are grammatically correct and the essay flows well. The thesis is clear and well argued for in the essay.CONTENTpeer 1      Wow, I really like your essay! You point out so many interesting things. Comparing Dracula to John the Baptist or anti-god is a great insight. I mean, everybody can see some Christian symbolic in the story but you really went deep into this analyses. And your ending. Just wow! Seriously!peer 2      Loved the aspect of christian imagery. I am just not sure about the last part where Mina and her unborn child have his blood in them. I was under the impression that after the death of Dracula, his blood too disappeared and Mina is purified.peer 3      I found the content of this essay to be informative. The author took the concept of Christianity and the several representative symbols such as the crucifix and the Eucharist and wove them into to the thesis of the essay. Also included were the God / Anti Christ aspects and was able to give explanations for the statements.peer 4      The essay has an interesting thesis, and shows a deep understanding of the text read.SCORE: 4COMMENTS:peer 1      The last paragraph blew my mind!!! I wish Stoker would have written another book about it :) Great essay!!!peer 2      Good work!peer 3      This essay gave me something to think about. I thought the author did a very good job.peer 4      Very interesting essay.;Thank you Florencia, those are really helpful comments! You&apos;re completely right in saying that I shouldn&apos;t attribute anything to Stocker&apos;s intention, as you say anything we come up with in our analysis is just conjecture.  And also I agree with you and peer 2 my final point about Mina was flawed, that needs correcting.  Thanks again for the feedback Florencia, really helps to have things to look out for in future essays.  ;I really like the idea of Dracula representing a invasion by the continent, it&apos;s something that I hadn&apos;t thought of when I read it so that&apos;s definitely made me think about it in a different way! It&apos;s very similar to the parallel you draw with the idea of Irish Independence, since Dracula could then be seen to represent invasive England, so the two points work well together. And of course the sexual imagery is very strong throughout the book so all very valid points.  I have to admit though that I agree with peers 2 and 3, it would work   better to focus on one particular theme and really explore it. Personally I would have loved to hear more about your first / third idea which I find really interesting. Although a very valid point, your second point is quite disconnected from the other two and with the limit we have on word count it means you can&apos;t really delve deep into any of your ideas. I think consolidating points 1 and 3 together and drawing out examples from the book would have been a really interesting essay from a different view point.  Or of course an essay focused on sexual imagery in Dracula would also work great since there is so much material to talk about, especially that scene where one of the female vampires almost starts to drink Harker&apos;s blood and Dracula stops her. In my opinion the most sexually charged scene in the whole book!You&apos;ve definitely enriched my reading though so overall well done!;Here&apos;s my essay too. I got some lovely feedback from my reviewers which is always great, but I&apos;d love any feedback on what I can improve or what you think the essay lacks.There is strong Christian imagery throughout Dracula, with Christian symbols and faith used as a defense and weapon against the vampires.

Your thesis is clear and you show some very good examples to support it. The form of your conclusion is rather unusual (but I love it anyway).peer 2      Beautifully written. Good work.peer 3      The form of this essay appears to be in very good condition. Spelling, grammar, and word usage work well with the points the author is trying to make. The author puts their ideas in an easily followed order. The ideas that are expressed are valid and documented correctly. I think this author should continue in the same manner.peer 4      The sentences are grammatically correct and the essay flows well. The thesis is clear and well argued for in the essay.CONTENTpeer 1      Wow, I really like your essay! You point out so many interesting things. Comparing Dracula to John the Baptist or anti-god is a great insight. I mean, everybody can see some Christian symbolic in the story but you really went deep into this analyses. And your ending. Just wow! Seriously!peer 2      Loved the aspect of christian imagery. I am just not sure about the last part where Mina and her unborn child have his blood in them. I was under the impression that after the death of Dracula, his blood too disappeared and Mina is purified.peer 3      I found the content of this essay to be informative. The author took the concept of Christianity and the several representative symbols such as the crucifix and the Eucharist and wove them into to the thesis of the essay. Also included were the God / Anti Christ aspects and was able to give explanations for the statements.peer 4      The essay has an interesting thesis, and shows a deep understanding of the text read.SCORE: 4COMMENTS:peer 1      The last paragraph blew my mind!!! I wish Stoker would have written another book about it :) Great essay!!!peer 2      Good work!peer 3      This essay gave me something to think about. I thought the author did a very good job.peer 4      Very interesting essay.;Hi Ana,  I&apos;ve missed the essay deadline too - although not with as good a reason as you. We had a bank holiday on Monday in Hong Kong and after finishing work really late on Tuesday night I came home thinking it was Monday and forgot to submit my essay. So frustrating and so stupid, especially since it was ready, for some unknown reason I didn&apos;t submit it right away....  Anyway I&apos;ve started an early &quot;post your essay&quot; thread because I&apos;d like to give feedback on some essays still as I find the grading process helpful,  and hopefully to get some feedback on my essay too - would you like to post your essay up and I&apos;ll give you my feedback? The thread is here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=533Hope you&apos;re feeling better after your hospital trip!  ;I&apos;m going to sound like a bit of a moron here, but in Hong Kong where I live there was a bank holiday on Monday so when I got back from work last night (Tuesday, it&apos;s now Wednesday morning here) I thought it was Monday night and forgot to submit my essay. I just woke up and realised what day it is and that I&apos;d missed the deadline.*slaps forehead*The worst thing is that the essay was all written out and ready to go, I   had it saved on my hard drive but for some reason hadn&apos;t submitted it early, a mistake I shall not make again. I thought I&apos;d use the forum instead for grading and start the post your essay thread early. I actually find the grading process really helpful - I&apos;ve learnt quite a lot from it so far - so I&apos;m keen to provide feedback for anyone that wants it. I&apos;ve also posted my essay below, if anyone has any feedback. Thanks!!Shelley   s original subtitle for Frankenstein was    The Modern Prometheus   . In Greek mythology Prometheus stole fire from the gods to bestow it upon man and faced eternal punishment as a consequence. This is very similar to the Fall of Man where Adam and Eve are punished for taking knowledge from God, and indeed Frankenstein can be seen to represent a second Fall as a consequence of scientific progress going too far.   Frankenstein reaches for forbidden knowledge, that of bestowing life which is the power of a god and which is reminiscent of the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. His punishment for acquiring this power is to be persecuted by his creation for the rest of his life. Frankenstein is aware of his fall, saying    the apple was already eaten, and the angel   s arm bared to drive me from all hope    - the hope of returning to his own version of Eden. The creature experiences his own version of The Fall when he is rejected by his creator, just as Adam was cast out of Eden. When the creature tries to reach for human companionship he becomes ashamed of the horror of his appearance and Adam and Eve become ashamed of their nakedness. The creature also becomes aware of his Fall when he reads Milton   s Paradise Lost, referring to Adam   s supplication to his creator and wishing for his own Eve to share his sorrows.   Frankenstein and the creature can therefore be seen as two sides of the same coin and indeed it isn   t coincidental that the creature is nowadays often referred to as Frankenstein. Together they represent mankind: they have both fallen and are fated to cause each other immeasurable pain until they destroy each other. The story can be seen as a warning that mankind will fall again if science is allowed to go too far, and man will in the end be the cause and instigator of his own demise.  ;</string>
            <string>I suppose what Suzanne means is not that crimes cannot be described in stories, but that how come so many crimes are in these fairy tales. After all, what we remembered from our childhood is beautiful girls with beautiful clothes, parties with sweet cakes, charming princes, birds and cats that can talk, and so on. I once tried to read again many fairy tales when I was a grown up, and I was shocked. I guess maybe we only learn to value life when we are adults in a modern society. We value it so much that many people now oppose the death penalty. Children, on the other hand, can be cruel sometimes. And in old times, people also didn&apos;t value life as much as we do now. One can get handed just because of stealing! It is unimaginable today.But anyway, people die all the time in novels and TV shows. I love Holmes, Poirot, CSI, Criminal Minds, Bones, etc. And there are so many dead bodies in there. But I am enjoying these stories and shows. So maybe, one way to read them is that one doesn&apos;t see them as stories that are not specifically created for children. And this is also a new angle of seeing these stories that this course gives us.;</string>
            <string>Now in natural science we are encouraged to us &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot;, and avoid  the tendence of hiding ourselves behind the passive voice. This reads better, of course, but I  think one important reason is that readers want to know for sure which is  the  authors&apos;s finding and conclusions, because they may have a different  interpretation for the authors&apos;s finding. So if we say &quot;it is concluded  that&quot; or start a conclusion with nothing, it is not clear whether this is the authors&apos;s conclusion or common knowledge, and readers don&apos;t want to be led. It saves a lot of time if authors say it clearly.I am not sure about social science or litterature.;Me too, it seems that it is the good timing saved them all rather than their courage or intelligence or whatever.Anyway, they already knew that Dracula would have to return to his castle, why bother chasing him around? They could just stay nearby his castle and wait, isn&apos;t it?;</string>
            <string>Suzanne,Please do not quit the course. Your feelings and opinions are yours, and, therefore , of value. I thought that your initial post was an extraordinary essay for this particular set of readings. I cannot watch the TV shows, and I found the stories horrific. But, I chose three that had a &quot;happily ever after&quot; sort of ending and wrote about those.   I think the professor should share the videos while/before we read...NOT AFTER!!! We are floating in a class, with no teacher, and the intelligenceand kindness of strangers for grades. It IS a real leap, and it surprised me as well.Kathleen Barry-Rodgers;</string>
            <string>I do not understand why we hear ideas about the extensive readings AFTER we have submitted our essays. Also, the essays are all the same: Thesis, proof, wrap-up. I tried to get creative with ALICE and was told that my essay sounded like it came straight out of the book, and I received a 1!!! If my writing sounds like Lewis Carroll&apos;s, what&apos;s wrong with this picture?   I have taught English for several years, and I make decisions based on the student and the excellence of the information within the new kind of essay!Now, I must write standard essays that could have been exciting and imaginative!!;Thanks for responding, Cheri. When/If you are a type &quot;A&quot;, and you really take this stuff so seriously, it is demeaning not to hear thoughtful replies. I have a Masters In English and am taking these classes for teaching re-certification....I knew I wasn&apos;t perfect, but I was willing to write outside the box, if you will. No more...which is, basically, kind of sad!   But, the reading takes a lot of time, and I am taking HISTORY OF ROCK, PT.I at the same time...It IS my summer. That rock class ROCKS!!!! And, if you need points, you get a Statement from that as well!   Have a great day!Kathleen :-);Again, thanks for your kindness...I won&apos;t get another teaching job...I am retired, and they don&apos;t want to pay someone at my level...but, I worked really hard while teaching to re-certify every five years, and I am not yet willing to let go! I adore teaching and learning, and I have had to remind myself of that in this class!   Just about to type my DRACULA essay...just took my Music test.I have great decaf, a sweet cat on my lap, and a wonderful jewelry show on TV!!!   Let me hear from you again...and, particularly, at the end of the class!!!Kathleen;Hi, Joanna and Cheri~Thanks for writing! The rubric is deceptive; It says to write an intelligent essay that will, essentially, broaden the knowledge of our classmates. I was happy to see it so broad...but, people are giving 1&apos;s because they are too narrow in their perceptions!   i know that from grad school and from teaching kids to write to a rubric, and then, expanding that rubric.   Is there any way to ask the professor? I can write to my music teacher if I need to! I grew up in the 1960&apos;s in Brooklyn, NY, so rock music is in my heart and soul. Try it! It is work, but joy is in the details!!!Kathleen;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>One of my reviewers said I needed citations. I came up with the ideas for my essay from the book!   Why do I need citations?   If I understand the readings, do we need to cite other sources???   I feel as if I really am alone in the wilderness here; read a book, write an super-intelligent essay for my &quot;peers&quot;, and listen to a discussion of the issues of the book AFTER submitting my writing!   I have written a 30 page French thesis IN FRENCH, and I had a semester and a mentor. This is a wasteland for me. Of course, it is clear that the good and evil in the human soul is the main thrust of our readings, and, I am enjoying them...but, I feel somewhat alone on a glacier when writing begins.   i actually raised my hand last week while reading on my sofa. I so needed to DISCUSS!Kathleen Barry-Rodgers;</string>
            <string>Hello Suzanne and Responders,I wanted to weigh in with some of my perspectives. I am a pacifist at heart, but I also have studied enough history to know that the humankind has used violence to fight off any peoples they consider to be &quot;others&quot;.   The Inquisition, the Crusades, the European colonization of the Western hemisphere, Asia and Africa, the Jewish Holocaust, and African slave trade  were all brutal periods in human history.   Unfortunately, violence continues in  more recent times even in the so-called &quot;more civilized&quot; Western civilizations.   Examples, such as the CIA  supported tortures and murders in Latin America during the 1970s and  80s (e.g., &quot;los desaparecidos&quot;.   Unfortunately, the &quot;eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth&quot; philosophy still permeates through much of the world.It  is not surprising to me that these fairly tales as oral history reflect their times and continue to resonate in modern times.   Isn&apos;t capital punishment/the death penalty still in effect in most parts of this country?   And, what about television and movies, and more importantly for our future, video games?   Isn&apos;t violence rampant throughout these media?So, the fact that fairy tales have violence is not shocking to me.   Unfortunately, the human race has not evolved beyond the use of force and violence to accomplish its goals.Fairy tales can serve as a reminder that we have to look deep and hard to uncover the ways in which we continue to glorify and justify violence from generation to generation.;Hello,I reviewed five students essays; however, I have not received any reviews of my essay.   Did I do something wrong?Thanls,Lourdes;Thank you for the response.   I thought I was supposed to get an email when the peer evals were ready, but with your input, I did find them afterall.   Thanks again!!;</string>
            <string>not happy about the professor&apos;s analysis that little red cap and the velvet of the cap&apos;s material refers to a woman&apos;s period. I think that the red cap is something that could be seen for miles, and that red is also a color for anger and passion. The velvet, in my mind, is something royal or special. If the little girl is tempted by the wolf who sends her to look for flowers, I see her led astray by disobeying authority, and can&apos;t put my thoughts around anything except straying from the path. The grandmother is old age, the huntsman is a knight in shining armor, but the child is just a foolish child.;</string>
            <string>I think the exposure to some  &apos;Britishness&apos; in your lifetime really helps one understand and appreciate Alice. I am American but with a slightly different take than your average American on it because my dad was Military and I lived in England from the ages of 4 until 10. So while I understand most of the  references  in the books, I can see while some of it may confuse someone who has never been exposed to British culture. Things that are second nature to a British reader such as afternoon tea, the references to  royalty   or the croquet game, may have the average American reader have to pause and think them through which I personally think makes the flow of the book a bit choppy since it is already a little scattered sometimes. Plus I find that most Americans are exposed to the Disney cartoon version early in life and never actually read the book until high school or later (if ever). Not sure when most British students are exposed to Alice, or how popular the &quot;Americanized&quot; movie version is in England, but I think this changes our  perception  of it as well.;I think the books are much more that of a young child&apos;s imagination and the way they see the world and not so psychedelic drug like. The movie adaptations on the other hand...is where I think this whole psychedelic drug thing started.  ;For those that are big fans of anything Wonderland or just want another take on it. You should read The Looking Glass Wars by Frank Beddor. But be warned this is a trilogy so with the amount of reading we already have you might want to wait until after this class is over.;</string>
            <string>I am an ESL and there&apos;s a question... Although POV from many characters, the language stays the same for all narrators, that is upsetting... No change in style or expressions from one to another... The same, btw, with Frankenstein. Or is it just my perception?;</string>
            <string>Mega lolz amazeballs. As you say yourself, let it go. This is the internet. Being anonymous doesn&apos;t make you a coward. If it looks good, who cares? ;);This is a quote from chapter 15...&apos;Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy&apos;s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.&apos;My puerile mind was reeling with sexual innuendo when I read this.;I refer you to my puerile mind ;);It&apos;s a cultural minefield. My advice is keep your pants on.;Paul, your mention of &apos;formulaic&apos; has got me thinking. One of the Lewis Caroll essays I reviewed was head and shoulders above the rest, but now I can&apos;t help thinking it was indeed formulaic.Everything was there, the form, the content, thesis, everything. I gave it (my only) six. It intrigued me enough to research further (eg. how language shapes our reality - the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis). Now I have I a nagging sense that it was almost too easy for the person who wrote it. This is obviously my own feeling and no reason to penalise the author (I&apos;d still give it a six) but I think from now on I will be more lenient to those who are less aquainted with the techniques that such essays require. I hope I&apos;m making sense. It&apos;s not one of my strong points.;The mechanical skills are definitely worth learning. They certainly can&apos;t do any harm. I&apos;ll remain satisfied if people keep sparking my imagination.;Also, what about the recent riots in Sweden?;Pray, let us see what you have to offer. Forfend that it do not be that which you seek to defend us against...;My lady, I am from simple Scandinavian stock. Sometimes my manners do beseech more comely verse.;The final sentence of the first paragraph is your thesis. No it isn&apos;t.Three sentences make a paragraph, oft forgotten. Nope.MLA format is your bible. I don&apos;t believe you.American spelling is correct. No, it&apos;s a version. Ask UK, Australia etc.Write something that enriches my understanding of the work concerned. YES!Feel free to patronise your fellow students. NO!;I&apos;m sorry but &apos;more important structural reasons&apos; doesn&apos;t make it more clear. I&apos;m not trying to be be awkward, I&apos;m just trying to understand what you&apos;re looking for when you review an essay, form as well as content. Would you comment on someone using more than three sentences in a paragraph, no matter how interesting? I&apos;m only asking because you&apos;ve chosen to post in this thread. Obviously, I&apos;m not trying to hold you to a rule (unlike some reviewers), but if you think there is a particular way that the many thousands of students on this course should write then it would be good to know (at least for the few that that look at this forum). Can you see where I&apos;m going? People will still criticise my spelling. They&apos;ll still lament my lack of paragraphs, at least in this post. Some may not even read this post because I haven&apos;t broken it down into bite-size chunks. Who cares? Who&apos;s listening? It&apos;s dark now so I&apos;m going to bed. I&apos;m still waiting for examples.;My gut instinct is that Victor was a cad, but I think you may be onto something. This course is brilliant. So many ideas and revelations.;Never mind Victor. Why does Walton worship the sun that shines out of his ......? Class? Complete lack of empathy for the proletariat? Pure, unadulterated privilege? The Monster is a portend of revolution. Anarchism and communism were de rigeur. I just made that up.;By which I mean...If a student produces something that is unique/radical/progressive with the literature concerned, will they receive recognition if academia (eg Professor Rabkin) subsequently makes use of it?There is nothing new under the sun but I&apos;m sure we have enough monkeys here to type something that no-one has thought of before.;</string>
            <string>I began reading &quot;Dracula&quot; yesterday, out loud to my  husband as we drove between our Father&apos;s Day weekend destinations. Oh, are we both so hooked! And neither of us really wanted to step into it, for the preconceptions we brought to it. I must confess, the idea of reading a book  about a  sexual predator is not appealing, but we have been so mesmerized by the writing and the interplay of Jonathan Harker with his environment and with the Count himself that we can hardly put this book down.It reminds me of the influence the work still has on our present culture. Just as fairytales are constantly being reconstructed in our movies (&quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot;, for example), so is Dracula. Whether as a gimmick to sell cereal, as an Abbott and Costello skit, or a guest on Scooby-Doo, there is something about Count Dracula our culture insists on sanitizing for our youth - and we love him! How many here saw &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot; when it came out? (I did!) More recently, the Twilight Series has captured the imaginations of many of today&apos;s teens.  Once we&apos;ve finished the book, my husband and I plan on watching &quot;Van Helsing&quot; again, to see what else we can pick up from that movie that might be based on the book. Just what is it that has inspired his continued, charismatic hold over us to this day? I am hoping this unit will help answer that for me. Poor Jonathan - I hope he makes it out of chapter IV!Anyone have other examples of Dracula&apos;s sustained influence over us today? Such as on T.V. or in the movies? I would love to hear your thoughts.;Ah! How could I forget! What a great example.;On the outside looking in ... I think that would be neat to see. After this thread (and this unit), I think I would like to see both Hellsing and Shiki.  ;</string>
            <string>That&apos;s a good question. What has changed ... ?I think, in the past 100 years, the most powerful force we have encountered is the advancement of knowledge in its infinitely various and expanding forms: science, technology, communications, and ect. Societies throughout history have always experienced change, yet our modern society experiences such an accelerated rate of change that I do not think we can truly comprehend how radically different our present world is in comparison to that of the not-so-distant past. Some time ago, I was listening to one of the Teaching Company&apos;s Great Courses on Medieval history. One thing the instructor tried to illustrate was the exceedingly slow pace of life, particularly for the rural peasant, and how slowly the entire culture changed over generations. Triggering events such as war, starvation, or plague often acted as catalysts for immediate change. Today, we might blame the stock market for causing job loss, or praise advancements in science for revolutionizing the way in which we stay in touch with each other (as in our iPads, or this MOOC). We are so accustomed to change that we are no longer alarmed by it.  I absolutely love the opening scenes where we meet Jonathan Harker on his cross-country trip to Castle Dracula. There is such an innocence in his observations; he is seeing the world for the first time. As I recall, the Victorian age was one of expansion, with Great Britain involving herself in the affairs of China, India, and Africa. America herself was on the advent of the Spanish-American War; the transcontinental railroad had been completed, her Native Americans re-settled into Reservations, and the West, closed. This was also the the era of the great explorers. &quot;King Solomon&apos;s Mines&quot; heralded in a popular fascination with adventure, and the world would remain fascinated with adventure as the automobile and the airplane came into play.  I think, in many ways, these years before The Great War (WWI) were the end of an age of innocence.  Perhaps this is what changed, our innocence. We discovered everything worthy of discovery, we conquered everyone worthy of conquering, and we did it in the name of the betterment of society. Bram Stoker wrote against this historical backdrop, and it seems to me that his timing in publishing a book that struggles with the loss of innocence as very serendipitous. And as for today? Why are monsters featured as saviors for us mortals? I don&apos;t know. I learned the other day, through my job, that there are a dozen venues in our city offering certain illicit services. My place of employment has been fighting against certain other types of semi-illegal businesses from entering our city - but all that we fight for today could be made legal by the courts tomorrow. Why do we fight at all? There is such a great yearning in our traditional American culture for right and justice, but no one seems to be able to agree on just what that is anymore. It&apos;s saddening, really. I no longer think the monsters in our movies are scary when the real world can be so much more terrifying. Perhaps, for all our great knowledge, what we have lost is wisdom. What dark mirror do our ninety-minute flicks reflect back to us? Perhaps it is we who have become the monsters.  ;I had to put it down because of work, so I&apos;m still reading it, but in the middle of the week I lost patience and found a few minutes to flip through and skim ahead! (I know, it&apos;s a terrible approach to a course focusing on close reading!) After having a few days away from it now, I find there are certain patterns that have come to light while thinking about it. Such as, the interplay of light/dark, day/night, mental stability/insanity, life/death, burial/birth, old age/youth, tradition/modernization, and so on. In fact, the more I think about it, the more elements come into play. Stoker really packed a lot into the complex web of characters and relationships he&apos;s created. This is definitely a book I want to read again!  ;You asked a good question: &quot;should I write about what I think or what peers want to read?&quot; These replies are great; they&apos;re focusing on structure and approach, and offer a lot of good advice. I&apos;d like to address another aspect to your question that also may help. This is a two-fold answer, so hang onto your perspective ...First, it was emphasized in the introductory video that our readers are our fellow peers. Based on this recommendation, then yes, you should follow the advice of your peers and gear your essays toward benefitting the enlightenment of the intelligent, thoughtful student in regards to the topic, material, and approach of your essays. This, ideally, will help your essay in earning their commendation, and at the least, their counsel.  On the other hand, my experience as a writer, coupled with the research I&apos;ve done concerning the publishing world (not academia), has shown me that when I write, the first person I need to write for is myself. I am my first reader. While I am skilled enough to write what other people would have me to write (specifically, business correspondences for my job), which I do well, I prefer writing for myself. When I write for myself, I find I take more time investing myself into my projects, and that the results have more impact on others, than if I had created some imaginary reader to write for whom I had never met.    Besides, one of the faults of choosing to write on a particular topic for the publishing world by basing the choice of topic on what&apos;s selling today is that, by the time your material hits the press, your topic is already out of date - especially if the average shelf life for new publications is only 3 months (I forget the source on that). Large publishing houses sort out what they are going to publish by way of using a heavily researched marketing questionnaire. (The first Harry Potter book hit something like three-fourths of their targets, which is why they pushed it so aggressively when it was released, offering alongside it books in a similar vein. This strategy is the same as grocery store selling candy and T.V. Guide at the checkout stand.)  Are you reading what you read last year? Not at all. And neither is anyone else.We have here perhaps 1,000 students. That&apos;s 1,000 possible different perspective on what constitutes a good, well-written and persuasive essay on such-and-such topic. The odds are that the majority of us (who are supposedly upper-level undergraduate English Majors) will share a common, well-educated background in the literary arts and therefore able to offer constructive criticism to the shared aim of bettering ourselves together throughout these units. However, then there are those of us here (myself included) who have little to no &quot;formal&quot; education in English, so our comments may not always be as academically sound or as productive as those who have been studying English for three or four years.  Basically, write what moves you. By all means, consider the suggestions you&apos;ve received and apply the skills you are learning in the academic setting, but don&apos;t forget that you are the primary recipient of your efforts in everything you do. If you choose to write on a topic that has challenged you, inspired you, or moved you in some way, you will be better able to express yourself more powerfully on the page, and  we - your readers - will be moved. Writing well is more than technique - it&apos;s art. Even in academia.;</string>
            <string>I loved all the conversations/dialogues in the two books. The Duchess on morals was definitely among the best of them! Brilliantly written. As to the purpose or point of it, I think it was trying to show a little girl&apos;s understanding of the concept of morals. Since it was all happening in Alice&apos;s head, the information had to be recycled out of what she had already been exposed to in the past, and it seems that all the &quot;dreadful nonsense&quot; in the conversations was just the result of her reasoning abilities trying to keep up with her wild imagination. (I know it&apos;s meant to be a dream and therefore not a conscious engagement of her imagination, but I don&apos;t know what I think about that).;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m reading &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot; edition, and found that all of these poems are parodies of songs and poems of the time that the children memorized as part of their lessons. It occurred to me that both these books are written to awaken imagination in childen, and to question everything that is imarted to them. In this regard, these songs show children that there is not only one way to do things (the way they are thaught), but that they can explore different alternatives to the same &quot;reality&quot; in the way that each child finds more interesting.;</string>
            <string>I still don&apos;t have a clue about what this sentence is supposed to mean, but it seems to me that &quot;not to be otherwise than&quot; would mean &quot;to be exactly&quot; instead of &quot;to be anything but&quot;? If so then the meaning is completely reversed...;I take &quot;otherwise&quot; to be a negative word as well, and the first two parts combined should equal &quot;imagine yourself to be otherwise than&quot;, i.e. &quot;Imagine yourself to be different from&quot; or &quot;never imagine yourself to be simply&quot;.Lewis Caroll&apos;s books are a disaster for non-native speakers.....;The two different interpretations probably come from the different ways of breaking the sentence, and I incline to believe the explanation on yahoo answers, because to view the entire part before the last 8 words as the subject, as suggested by people on wordreference forum, neither makes sense nor seems grammatically correct to me. But again, I&apos;m not a native English speaker.;</string>
            <string>Hi Alan,  Thank you for letting us know!When I view the assignment from your account, I can see that the cut/paste has added some formatting text that&apos;s eating up your word count. I&apos;ve deleted that, so you should be able to enter your essay now without exceeding the word count. I would suggest cut/pasting from a plain text editor, rather than from Word, if you have one on your computer - that&apos;s less likely to create a problem. In the meantime, we&apos;ll look into why the Word formatting is transferring so badly (I know that many students use the method you describe to compose and submit coursework, so we should get this working if we can).

            <string>I faced the same thing, barely managing exactly 320 words. I think the themes found in Alice are so complex it&apos;s a pity we can&apos;t even discuss one in detail. We have to make do with a fraction of an idea.  ;If you have the possibility I recommend going through &quot;Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass&quot; the 2004 edition published by Barnes &amp; Noble Classics. It has interesting Introduction, Notes and Further Reading which may give you another view of the books. It&apos;s a nice addition, even if the essay part is now over.   &quot;She&apos;s in that state of mind...that she wants to deny something - only she doesn&apos;t know what to deny!&quot; - White Queen, about the Red Queen.;</string>
            <string>(please continue the fantasy by adding one sentence);  banished the Doomsday/Freedom Clock into the depths of the mystical U-michi Forest, hoping one day a student with bright eyes and bushy tail will fulfil the hallow prophecy, which foretold  _  ;</string>

            <string>The cat mewed in foreshadowing.;I think I clicked the &apos;submit&apos; button for my Lewis Carroll essay less than a minute after the deadline, and it still got through. I also managed to edit and re-submit a few times after as the system still allowed me to, which is weird?  Does this mean my essay got through, however?;O_O Good point.;</string>
            <string>I was a bit disappointed. The initial description of Harker&apos;s life in the castle was so good and even the transition period for Lucy into vampirism was filled with tension and excitement. However once we get Jonathan back in one piece, the story kind of fell apart for me. Mina was too one-dimensional for me to garner any sympathy for her. Especially after the obvious reveal that she had become one of Dracula&apos;s minions. The end is supposed to infuse you with the suspense of all the members of the team chasing Dracula, but the overlapping entries from each story-line just makes it seem too rushed. The final battle was basically just a chase where the enemy was stuck in a box the whole time. I guess my expectations were too high, but the start of the book was great and the whole thing just tapered off for me.  ;</string>
            <string>I had the same feeling reading Dracula as when I reread Lord of the Rings after having seen Peter Jacksons film. It is incredible that all the actionscenes take so little space in the original, whereas the descriptions of people and places makes most of the story. Focus has surely changed over time! But to my surprise I found Stokers choice of telling the story through documents and diaries very modern and original. And I loved the way he wrote different peoples accents into the dialogue. It said so much of the times and the personalities. Great read but a little too long.  ;I don&apos;t know if it is racist, stereotyping or just a sign of the times when Dracula was written but isn&apos;t it food for thought that Draculas helpers are either jews, mentally ill or gypsies? ;I think Van Helsings most important talent is his openmindedness. He takes both science and religion into consideration but also superstition. His use of hypnosis is very interesting because thats neither science nor normal Christian practise. He takes the best from all worlds and that makes him - in my opinion - a very modern character.  ;</string>

            <string>You have a point there, Stephanie. Ultimately, it&apos;s really about whose rules of the game one plays by, and from whose perspective you choose to look at things from.  ;</string>
            <string>Each student has a specific way of learning, to make the long short, i will go to the point.i&apos;m sure that this will help you for the next readings.I&apos;m a Auditory type, i&apos;m listening to Dracula&apos;s book, it&apos;s better than read for me.Hope it will help! :DTypes of Learning Styles  Types of Learning Styles: The Three Main TypesThere are three main types of learning styles: auditory, visual, and kinesthetic. Most people learn best through a combination of the three types of learning styles, but everybody is different.  Auditory Learners: HearAuditory learners would rather listen to things being explained than read about them. Reciting information out loud and having music in the background may be a common study method. Other noises may become a distraction resulting in a need for a relatively quiet place.  Visual Learners: SeeVisual learners learn best by looking at graphics, watching a demonstration, or reading. For them, it&apos;s easy to look at charts and graphs, but they may have difficulty focusing while listening to an explanation.  Kinesthetic Learners: TouchKinesthetic learners process information best through a &quot;hands-on&quot; experience. Actually doing an activity can be the easiest way for them to learn. Sitting still while studying may be difficult, but writing things down makes it easier to understand.  Types of Learning Styles: What Everybody Should KnowAlthough most people use a combination of the three learning styles, they usually have a clear preference for one. Knowing and understanding the types of learning styles is important for students of any age. It is advantageous for students to understand their type of learning style early on so that homework and learning may become easier and less stressful in the future. Although it may be tempting to stick with what works, it&apos;s important to practice and train the other types of learning styles early on so that, as he grows, the child can utilize the other types just as effectively.

            <string>Unfortunately, I could not finish the writing. I am hoping for better job with the next one. As far the first essay, I was happy with it.  ;</string>

            <string>Problem: Plagiarism for Peer Assessmenthttps://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/human_grading/view/courses/970529/assessments/14/submissions/1085Browser: ChromeOS: Windows VistaAdditional details: The piece seemed to be cut and pasted, so I copied a section and then searched in Google for it. The following website (http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/alice5.html) came back with what looked like a word-for-word match, including a full stop (period) in the wrong place;</string>
            <string>Ladies, Gentlemen,  bar-guests an    bogles, might I perhaps suggest that you have entirely missed the point? When one spends time reviewing the work of others, this is never time which has been misspent. You have picked apart the concepts of another&apos;s thinking on a topic you yourself have only recently reviewed. Whether or not this other expression of concept is new, if this gestalt is grave, or gravely mistaken, matters less than the fact that their perspective has allowed you to ruminate in different directions. The hindu maxim that work is its own reward is never truer than here. I&apos;m not looking for a great grade. I&apos;m here for the intellectual enlargement. Those that skimp on the grading degrade themselves.  ;My perspective would be that the point of this thread is to express oneself!  I fear I have ms-represented myself. I&apos;m certainly not intending to infer that any perspective mooted is unworthy, but to observe that those who spend less time grading do themselves more disservice that those who are graded, and to observe that time spent grading is as important as time spent reading and writing in allowing students to think and grow.As for Sisyphus, there exists, for me at least, a key differentiation between the rote of purposeless drudgery and the role of pleasurable dissection. It is, nonetheless, a lovely counterpoint, and one well suited to the coursework of myths and legends.;</string>
            <string>Megan, as per Prof. Rabkin: &quot;We are a community. In our community, the readings, my videos, and your postings may be considered &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Their contents do not require citation in this course.&quot; So, hopefully, you won&apos;t get dinged for it at all!;I ran into a similar problem. By far, the most common feedback I&apos;ve given (and received, when I was vague in my first essay) is to clearly state a thesis. The guidelines for peer evaluation are pretty specific that we need to look for &quot;the details and logic of the argument,&quot; so if no argument is present I can&apos;t imagine the essay meeting the requirements of the assignment.;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>The thesis of one of the essays I&apos;m grading is about how science lead to the writing of Frankenstein. Their first paragraph is about how it was written during the &quot;year without a summer,&quot; which was a natural event not well understood at the time. Their second paragraph is about how Arctic exploration was being reported in the press at the time, and that led to inaccurate descriptions in the novel.I&apos;m having difficulty assigning a grade to this essay, because it borders on discussing non-literary matters, as warned against in the assignment description. The essay does not link the first event to the text at all, even to say that &quot;the year without a summer as a scientific unknown, which may have caused the author to write about another unknown.&quot; The second point shows why Frankenstein may have been interesting to readers at the time, but it doesn&apos;t provide much insight into the novel itself.I do think that an essay about the context in which a novel was written is valuable, but does it seem like it fits the criteria for this assignment? And if it does, is this thesis sufficient to earn them a 2, if they don&apos;t explicitly link it a theme or topic in the text?;</string>
            <string>I decided to assign the essay a 3 for form and a 1 for content. I tried to thoroughly explain to the author why I did so, so hopefully the feedback is valuable, even if they disagree with my conclusion. It seemed to me that the only link between the essay and the novel was a single sentence that mentioned how it opened and concluded in the Arctic. If not for that one sentence, the entire essay could have been written without even reading the novel. Merely stating what happened, without explaining or even indicating how that affected the novel to me does not demonstrate a high enough level of analysis for what is intended to be an upper-level undergraduate course.As I said, I think that kind of analysis is potentially very valuable, and I&apos;m glad that Professor Rabkin expands on it in his lectures, but I think it&apos;s worth remembering that his lectures are not limited to 320 words. Given that much space, I think it would be very difficult to properly explain the relevant historical context to a novel, which may be why they are limited only to &quot;literary&quot; matters (which, I agree, can be a broader category, but the assignment specifically asks for &quot;plot, style, theme, structure, imagery, allusion, narrator reliability, and so on&quot;). It&apos;s not that other areas of analysis are  irrelevant, they are perhaps too complex to address in so small a space.;</string>
            <string>Nobody seems to have mentioned this yet, and I thought it worth mentioning, so here goes. A few years ago, the British artist and writer Bryan Talbot wrote and published a graphic novel called Alice in Sunderland. It&apos;s a bit difficult to describe, but it&apos;s a wonderfully rich exploration of the cultural history of the north-east of England, interspersed with references to the life and works of Lewis Carroll. And that doesn&apos;t remotely do it justice - it&apos;s an absolute masterpiece. There are some better reviews here and here.;</string>
            <string>Oh yes, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessary (or perhaps even that desirable) to read Alice in Sunderland for the purpose of this course, I just mentioned it because it&apos;s worth reading in its own right, and it&apos;s partly relevant to Carroll&apos;s work.   As, for that matter, is the rest of Bryan Talbot&apos;s work.   The Luther Arkwright and Grandville books are tremendous fun.   The Tale of One Bad Rat is a thought-provoking and ultimately heart-warming story about a young woman who escapes an abusive father to live in the Lake District, told with copious references to the books of Beatrix Potter. His latest work is the illustration for Dotter of Her Father&apos;s Eyes, written by his wife Dr Mary Talbot, which explores the relationship between James Joyce and his daughter Lucia, and also Talbot&apos;s own relationship with her father, himself an academic and scholar of Joyce&apos;s work.   All jolly good stuff.But I&apos;m getting a little off-topic.   The other book I wanted to mention, which I think also hasn&apos;t been referred to yet, is Jeff Noon&apos;s Automated Alice. It&apos;s a bit difficult to describe (especially since it&apos;s about a decade since I last read it) but it&apos;s a third book in his Vurt series of SF novels, and a sort of sequel to Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. Wonderfully bizarre, I thought.;</string>
            <string>Dear All, I missed yesterday deadline, however   I will be very greatful if any of you reads and comment on my essay. I couldnt post on coursera, but I did on my blog: http://blogorigin.wordpress.com/.  Appriciate your help.  ;Thank you guys, you have been very helpful. ;</string>
            <string>Hi Antonia,this is a very interesting essay. Could you please share the sources you used? I would like to read more about Andras Feldmar. Are your materials in english? Thank you so much.;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>Hi Kevin, what an interesting idea! This is indeed enriching my experience of reading. I hope you will post your essay on the forum when you finish it.;</string>
            <string>I don&apos;t think all those taking the course are English students (I have a degree in Social Science) so finding themes may be more difficult for some students compared to others, I know I looked into theme finding in depth before attempting my first essay.  ;</string>
            <string>So, what&apos;s up with the orange marmalade in the the first chapter when Alice falls down the rabbit hole? Why orange? Why marmalade? What doest it mean? Prof. Rabkin mentions the orange and the colour of the sun but is it just that? Why then marmalade and not just an orange? I have the feeling there is something more to it but I can&apos;t figure it out.Oh, and by the way, does anyone really like orange marmalade??;Nice article;I have been reading a little bit about marmalades and first of all, I must point out that I had misunderstood the term marmalade. I am from Spain, and in Spanish, jam and marmalade share the same word: &quot;mermelada&quot;. Second, and most important, I hadn&apos;t realised orange marmalade was so typically British. Having this in mind, I am ready to accept that the orange marmalade in the rabbit hole has no secret special meaning, it may just be a typical British thing and that&apos;s it.This, of course, doesn&apos;t change the fact that I don&apos;t like orange marmalade (why would you want a jam to bitter??). My favourite is peach jam.;</string>
            <string>;-) http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/12/just-a-cigar/;</string>
            <string>Hi all, I looked at wikipedia (please don&apos;t hate me).   Jam is particularly North American.   Jelly is basically the same as jam, but it has the additional step of straining it to remove the pulp.   Marmalade has the fruit peel in it.   Wikipedia noted that the Seville orange is the benchmark fruit for citrus marmalade in Britain.   So, perhaps it was one of those asides to let the reader know that Alice was falling down a &quot;classy&quot; rabbit hole.;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/m/marmalade/index.htmlCurses, I&apos;m now on a marmalade quest!   There is even a world marmalade festival!   Three Pips, and a hooray.   ;</string>
            <string>FIG!! We have fig preserves in our family.   I love them.   A wonderful summer treat is frozen figs.   Sigh, they aren&apos;t ready yet.   ;</string>
            <string>Marmalade represents the cozy side of life.   As she falls through the rabbit hole she is transitioning from &quot;cozy&quot; to &quot;crazy.&quot;   The walls of the hole are lined with artifacts from a comfortable life but when she grabs the jar a marmalade, it&apos;s empty,   suggesting that &quot;cozy&quot; is a thing of the past and something new is ahead.   If this story took place in the USA it would be strawberry jam.;I wish this course had some quizzes or some other non-peer related assessment as well as the essays.   I got a good grade on the first essay, a bad grade on the 2nd, and who knows what kind of grade I will get from the random group of folks who get my 3rd essay.   It all seems so arbitrary.   It would be a real shame if after reading all these books and trying to whittle ten essays down to 320 words I don&apos;t even manage to get a certificate!   ;I was relieved that it ended rather easily.   Cliff-hangers are exhausting!;</string>
            <string>  I thought it started out pretty good and was quite scary   but as the novel wore on it was almost entirely a description of how miserable and wretched Frankenstein was feeling.   Just on and on and on, interspersed with some descriptions of scenery, only to return to variations on &quot;I am the most miserable human in the world.&quot;;Here&apos;s the thing:   we are supposed to write something that enriches people&apos;s understanding.   After trying to be too clever for the first few peer assessments I have decided the following:   Is the essay grammatically correct, well-organized,   spelled properly,   etc?   If so, it gets a &quot;3.&quot;    As for content,   if I am &quot;enriched&quot; by reading it,   if I can tell the author put some effort into it,   it also gets a &quot;3&quot; from me.   This is a literature class,   for crying out loud,   not a creative writing class.   We are not here to create the   perfect essay,   just to &quot;enrich the thoughtful reader.&quot;   Otherwise,   writing these essays is just too darn stressful.;I don&apos;t understand why the marks from peer are more important then this knowledge.,,,&lt;&lt;&lt;Great observation which puts it all into perspective,   thank you!;</string>
            <string>I&apos;ve done some complaining about peer reviews but I am enjoying the course and I intend to see it through to the end.If people are having problems getting through all the readings,   remember,   Librivox is your friend!;I am usually working on a few Saylor Foundation courses, especially their Medieval literature and history courses.   Saylor isn&apos;t as electronically sophisticated as Coursera.   Each course is basically a reading list with links to the readings.   There are also links to videos and audio lectures around the web.   Each course is quite long and involves a lot of reading, much like you would find at a real university. They have discussion forums but they are not as lively as those here on Coursera.    There&apos;s no time limits, it&apos;s strictly &quot;work at your own pace.&quot;   No papers to write,   no peer reviews (yay!) and only one final exam at the end of the course.   This is for literature and history courses;   science, math and computer courses may be different.   I know the science/ math courses have videos on iTunes.    Coursera is probably the better of the two,   if they are offering what you are interested in.   You get to &quot;know&quot;: the Coursera professors while the Saylor teachers are anonymous compilers of links (in the courses I&apos;ve taken).   I always have at least one Coursera course I&apos;m working on.   I work on the Saylor courses at my leisure.   They are both GREAT.   ;Georgy,   this is very interesting.   What is the moral of &quot;The Stone Flower?&quot;   I wonder if I can find an English translation.   Thank you for posting this.;</string>
            <string>I usually use a title as my thesis statement.;</string>
            <string>I like the lectures, but this course is seriously mistitled.   A better name would have been &quot;The Ancient History of Fantasy and SF.&quot;   The average age of the texts is well over a century.   Nothing written in the lifetime of the average student is included.   Nothing I haven&apos;t read - well maybe one or two of the Grimm tales excepted - is included.I&apos;m also a bit annoyed by the change from four peer reviews to five.;</string>
            <string>You are right, I missed Doctorow, but 1950 is 63 years ago and 1969 is 44 years ago.   Those are in my lifetime, but my guess is that the average student is younger.   ;</string>
            <string>The fundamental issue is the peer grading.   The short midweek time window does not fit my schedule, but more importantly, I haven&apos;t gotten (or given) very useful advice.   Advice ranged from trivial (an argument with where I put a comma) to obtuse (two graders failed to get what seemed to me a rather obvious point).;</string>
            <string>After reading the responses to the Grimm essay I was shocked how little effort people put into them, i couldn&apos;t even tell if anyone read my work. So for the Alice essay I put in a little mistake, in the last sentence I replaced Wonderland with Neverland just to see if anyone would notice.  I just read the responses to my Alice essay and I was extremely disappointed. Only one person responded with anything worth reading and they were the only one to notice the Neverland addition. Am I the only one who has gotten sub par reviews? How much time do you put into your reviews? Is this an anomaly? ;My punctuation has much to be desired. Could you please explain why the apostrophe is unnecessary? Doesn&apos;t the essay belong to you?Thanks, Unfortunately I got the name from the TV show Babylon 5 and not the Iliad character, but I do enjoy both. ;</string>
            <string>Eschew obfuscation.;</string>
            <string>NO_POSTS_AT_ALL</string>
            <string>The NY Botanical Garden has created a small-scale model of the garden depicted in this story.   To see a photo and read a short article, go tohttp://www.npr.org/2013/07/06/199234929/growing-the-latest-in-16th-century-medicine?utm_source=NPR&amp;u...;Gustavo, the NYC Botanical Garden is exhibiting a recreation of the garden in Padua that &quot;was created in 1545 as part of the University of Padua medical school,&quot; which is the garden central to the story. I do not think the Botanical Garden was trying to recreate Hawthorne&apos;s vision of that garden.;</string>
            <string>We don&apos;t get to know who read our work. We don&apos;t get to know who is responding to our work. We don&apos;t get to defend against criticism or say thanks for the compliment. This anonymity in peer-review is strange but I understand why it&apos;s happening. Since I can&apos;t say this directly to my reviewers, I would like to shout blindly into the room a thank you. To all of you have and will continue to take the time and effort to give thoughtful review, critique, and advise, thank you.   ;</string>
            <string>I had a couple of essays to review that were using &quot;I&quot;. I did make a note about it in the comment section, but I didn&apos;t give a lower grade for that.If the guidelines stated that you should not use &quot;I&quot;, it would be different. As it is, I give an advice, I don&apos;t mark down. I think it&apos;s fair, isn&apos;t it?;</string>
            <string>Wow! Samantha, what you just wrote here has moved me. You have really inspired me. Thank you.;</string>
            <string>the story is written by an 18 year old kid, who ran away from her father with an older man who took her and her sister around europe. what do you expect?  ;i didn&apos;t mean to comment on the writing quality or n the quality of the story. just on yhe perspective. someone of 60 would have a different perspective i think.  just like the special setting of the writing influences the book (written as a sort of game during the vacation). i feel this accounts for some of the tricks used (travel, letters as form etc.) i am reading the book with interest and relate the troubles i find in reading it to the period and the genre. but that doesnt mean i am not thinking about who wrote. but i meant no disrespect for her age or gender or personal situation. i can see how one can feel that from the way i wrote it down. so my question is: in what way do you feel the person and the situation of the author influenced the book she wrote ;anna, do these thouhgts influence your reading? marc ;This is a bit complex, but i like the idea. I can relate to the point that her relationship Shelley would have made her feel shamefull and guilty from time to time and that she used this feeling to write a horror story about feelings she knew.In my opinion the monster then would be the relationship she has created and which comes at her to haunt her. Nice post, thnx!;Wow. A lot of information. So, she is teasing him a bit during the hollidays? Has Shelley had any difficulties with his family? I know his love life was erratic, so he may have created a few casualties there. How do you see it then?Marc;that sounds a bit arrogant ;I like this idea. I thought the monster was created out of abandonment and rejection. The way Frankenstein was raised made him into an alchemist who found it difficult to attatch and submerged himself in creating life with his science.If you take this reasoning one step further you get your point of view of a sort of dr jekyll and mister hide. Or that the monster really doens&apos;t exist.The story can be a fantasy told by a sailor about a sick man. Or anything else. What the story does remains the same: it tells you about how horrifying things can be created by man and how one should be careful that one&apos;s creations don&apos;t run wild.I like your idea. It makes the story more fantastic. And that what is was supposed to be, a fantanstic story.;</string>
            <string>something totally useless like computers, internet, computergames, mobile phones etc. All these dvices were thought useless at one time or the other. The butterfly is a symbol for succesful transformation, what si the succes, what is brought to lifehere? What is so beautiful or important that it is better than marriage and procreation? Or is this just a misconception of the engineer/artist? ;</string>
            <string>oedipal structure is about wrestling for power and taking the prize that comes with it ;roussea may would have read it in reverse: if we become cultured we loose our natural virtues. In isolation nothing goes wrong. It goes wrong in bringing animals together in a man made paradise and humanizing them. ;nice posts. boats and the conservation of humanity as the female element or the prize helps me developping new insights in the structure of the story. thnx, it is fun talking to you in this thread ;</string>
            <string>I loved &apos;birthmark&apos; too! Loving the Hawthorne readings !;</string>
            <string>I think I spotted a few people in the introduction about taking both courses. How do you find it going? Do you think you&apos;ll be able to manage both until the end?For me I took &quot;Fiction&quot; first and was late in finding out about this course by a week. So far I&apos;m still in schedule of the reading and assignments, but that&apos;s because I&apos;ve read a few books before from both courses (and I don&apos;t re-read them). I&apos;m planning to be on schedule for this course until Frankenstein but I&apos;m not sure what will happen next yet. At this point if I have to pick one to accomplish, I would stick to the Fiction of Relationship course, but of course that&apos;s not to say I won&apos;t be reading more of the books here and watching the lectures. Anyone taking both courses willing to share their experience so far?;That comment about chick stuff sounds a bit unfair. It&apos;s good that there is a good mix between female and male writers, and Manon Lescaut is even written by male. Also the course is titled The Fiction of Relationship, so it is expected to concentrate on relationships in fiction.;Maria, I also wish we don&apos;t have to complete assignment each week for this course. In fact it is possible that I&apos;ve spent more time for the peer reviews than my own essays. That&apos;s one aspect that I did not quite anticipate at the beginning (while I&apos;ve been browsing around coursera for a while, this is the first time I&apos;m following the courses seriously so I wasn&apos;t familiar with the peer review system). ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m completely on the other side! I got bored with Dracula and am really loving Frankenstein! (though I&apos;m just 20% in now);I&apos;m reading the free one on Kindle, but I&apos;m not sure which edition it is, 1818 or 1831. It seems to be the 1818 one, since it doesn&apos;t have the 1831 introduction. The description on amazon seems to imply this too.Anyone knows? Does it matter which edition? ;Patricia, from what I read around it does seem that the text changed, though again I&apos;m not sure how significant.;Thanks Jeremy for confirming the Amazon edition. I have been reading it 20% in, so I&apos;m gonna keep going. I do plan to read the introduction, but I usually save introduction until I read the text because introductions often contain spoilers! I noticed from a quick look at the beginning of the 1831 version at gutenberg, that the 1818 version does not have the Preface (so it starts directly from the Letters).;Thanks Anna. Very odd that the Preface is missing in the free Kindle/Amazon version. To clear things up, I think the Preface here should be considered part of the text, but introductions I find usually contain spoilers because they are added at a later date (in this case the one in 1831 version). In any way I will surely read them all later :);One section (or sections?) that I thought was too long was Victor&apos;s description of his Agony. It just seemed to go on and on and on. I was like, I get it already! Why don&apos;t you do something about it or move on?!;</string>
            <string>I have to disagree about Justine. I do think Victor does not make any real effort to save her. Worried about telling &quot;a wild story&quot; sounds like a very weak excuse to me. His endeavor was wild, hence his story would also be wild. He is more worried about being thought crazy than giving a shot at telling the real truth. The bottom line is, he is not responsible enough for his actions!I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s Shelley&apos;s intention to make the creature more sympathetic than Victor or not, but I found it a lot easier to sympathize with him. Like a child, he does not know any better. Articulated in speech does not make him wise in the ways of the world. ;I have to add, that if I were the monster, were that pissed off, I would want Victor to have the courage to destroy me as he&apos;s given me life. I think the dismissals were the most painful. Victor keeps saying &quot;Begone, you evil one!&quot; You could fight me or destroy me, but do not ignore me! Every time he dismisses the monster I felt like jumping at him and scratching his eyes out (and probably the monster too).We can see this too at the end when Victor finally decides to chase after the monster that he keeps leaving clues or even slows down, just so Victor could catch up. The monster, like all of us, does not want to be dismissed, ignored, or forgotten.;I&apos;m actually relieved that Prof just put the nail in the coffin so to speak. I never warmed up to Victor and do think he is mean and egotistical. I never believe his love for Elizabeth too, or anyone else for that matter. More that he *thinks* he loves them, that he *has to* love them, but he does not. He never cares about anyone else but himself.;Nice, didn&apos;t notice that. I did think his name was oddly &quot;exotic&quot;.;</string>
            <string>I had the same experience last week, but everything seems to be okay. I&apos;ve got my results back too after that. ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m in both, but I&apos;m only attempting the essays in The Fiction of Relationship. Although I&apos;ve read many of the works in both courses, in many cases it has been decades since I read them, so I&apos;m really going to have to apply myself. I&apos;ll probably end up signing up for this course again when I have more time so that I can give it more attention. ;</string>
            <string>I enrolled in both courses initially and had to skip the entire first week in Fiction of Relationship because work at my job grew to murderous proportions. I thought I had to give up  that course.Then, because of some glitch in the Coursera peer evaluation, they scrapped the first assignment. If ever there was a reason to interpret divine intervention, it was then! I finished Manon Lescaut on a Sunday and submitted the assignment the next day. I am on track ever since.Taking both courses is a difficult proposition. It&apos;s only possible if you&apos;ve read a couple of novels beforehand which is why I don&apos;t have to read Dracula for Fantasy and Science Fiction or most of H.G. Wells either.The dream lives on!;</string>
            <string>I think that, by today&apos;s standards, Carroll&apos;s statements and behavior (letters, nude photography of minors) seem decidedly wrong. His sexualizing of girls seems like clear abuse of them. I had not known this about him, and it bothers me very much. The parents who allowed their daughters to be used in this way are equally suspect.  ;I was disappointed, too. I was expecting a twist in the plot, perhaps implicating one of the &quot;good&quot; people as, in fact, an Undead.The Note contradicts the statement at the beginning, which implies the veracity of the various accounts of events. I don&apos;t really understand the meaning of this.;What do you understand to be the meaning of the Note at the end that calls into question the accuracies of the accounts given earlier in the book?;I&apos;m also wondering why the narrater singles out &quot;the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and Myself, and Van Helsing&apos;s memorandum&quot; as authentic, while the other documents are not.;The Note at the novel&apos;s end questions the authenticity of most of the documents that make up the novel. Does this mean the events told about should be questioned? See also discussion under &quot;chronology of events&quot; thread.;Also interesting to note that Harker, as a lawyer, would have particular experience and training with respect to the authenticity of documents.;</string>
            <string>I suppose many people like me knew Alice through Walt Disney, never read the book... but the cartoon delighted me... I would be interested what is left or added in this films and others related to fairy tales... what is the interest of those global machine to show fairy tales...Thanks very much Pr Rabkin for the fluid you transmit by your skills at make me love the books you present...Serge ;</string>

            <string>Dear Eric Rabkin, I am delighted you give me access to literature and books that I would never have known without your wonderful telling tales passion.     But your assertion about sex and &quot;trophy woman&quot; is far from being scientific, surely opinions drew from people&apos;s/Hollywood magazine but not from the reality. I suppose a Trophy woman is a woman younger than her sexual partner, 15-20 years may be man show around him. In his late twenties a man marries a woman of his age and many years together, few children after, the passion between both partners fade away... and one of the spouse, husband most probably decides to continue his life with a younger woman: painful, for many, but if you are talking about trophy, you compare women to game killed for their Ivory, not sure it is like that... women are mature, smart like men and know what they are doing, they can be wrong like all of us, but able to see they are going to marry someone who is going to be sick and die before them if they stay until the end... thus I would also add that some women marry a trophy man... I also disagree with this term...  I suppose like me the picture of General Petraeus former US spy with his wife stroked you when you compare her with his biographer A.K.A love affair. Darwin told us  _ I have a family, two children, with a woman 22 years younger than me, I have female friends 35 younger than me  _ all mature adults. Am I a trophy? Are they trophy? Are we all trophies at some point of time in the eye of the beholders, may be   _ Dear professor, I would advise those who believe in    trophy woman    to meet people whom they consider the    trophy    and see how they react to this idea, but we have to stop listening to gossips.   Professor, Thanks again for your wonderful talent and your love for sharing.  Serge   ;</string>
            <string>I would be grateful if the readers and writers here can share their thoughts on my understanding of the creative writing process.I find it a bit counterproductive to find the deeper themes and beliefs in texts. I take  Aesop&apos;s fables as an example as it was the first reading assignment. For instance, in Aesop&apos;s fables, I taking the following as an example of a write-up:&quot;Natural symbolism is another prominent feature that immediately helps us relate to key meanings in the text.   Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.&quot;Please note that I have no disregard for this wonderful analysis. However, as somebody keen on getting his creative juices flowing to develop ideas and concepts better, as per my understanding, one would be better off not breaking everything down intellectually to this level. I do not believe writers critically break down associations and meanings held by objects and people, but do this in a more intuitive   way. Thus, creative writing, like music and art, is about what feels right and not what looks analytically and thematically accurate. I understand that snakes symbolically represent deceit, betrayal and slyness. I could see that in Adam and Eve&apos;s story, and could see that in Harry Potter as well. I would not sit and analyse the thematic unity in character traits of snakes before I get one to star in my books. I would be aware of this intuitively.My question is, in order to write creatively - is this not something to be understood and appreciated in an under the radar sense? As readers, the reason why books wow us is in their ideas, the motion, the stillness, the concepts and the beauty. Creative beauty, in my opinion, does not come through hard analysis, formulas, associations and dissection, but through letting one&apos;s imagination fly and feeling the beauty of ideas and concepts take over oneself.  How exactly then does critically analysing works to this depth help?;That&apos;s a beautiful answer! Thanks for sharing your insight!  I have a fear though. I fear that I will not be able to see the quilt as complete, as I used to before critically reading it. Would that make me lose sight of the sense of beauty and awe I find in a piece of work? Would deconstructing something to it&apos;s bare components make me lose the &apos;feel&apos; of the story?  I think (and this is just a personal opinion and may be flawed) that to recreate magic in my writings, I need to keep my finger on the pulse of the what made the story awesome. By critically reading the story, and breaking it down into sub components, I would be able to see how the story is structured, how the author put certain events in a certain order to keep the reader guessing etc. This does help me understand ideas behind these areas as well. I feel I would however, lose track of what I loved about the story and the feeling I experienced. Ultimately, when writing a story, I often aim to recreate the kind of magic I felt while reading the other texts I have read. I feel that if I lose sight of what made those stories special, I will not be able to recreate that magic.Is there a recommended way in which authors should analyse stories? Should they do this critically? Or should they stick to the feel? I am not sure, but I do want to build better habits to write better stories! What do you think?;Loved your answer, and I connect to your thoughts very well.Thank you! That helps.;I agree. I often tend to wonder whether there is any intrinsic value to the deep intellectual analysis that works are put under. Those writings weren&apos;t made for this, and the analysis leads to naught. The purpose of the writings was to raise questions, not think about Mary Shelley and how her meeting with her husband shaped her decision to write about Frankenstein.As somebody who wishes to get into writing, I think it&apos;s a good idea to stop analyzing (or berating oneself at the dearth of intellectual output), and start writing. Picard out.;</string>
            <string>Hello!So I&apos;m not quite done reading Dracula, but I&apos;ve come across an interesting theory in casual conversation with a few people who noticed what I was reading. Two different people both said &quot;oh, that&apos;s an allegory for the gays, right?&quot; And I was surprised and also a little confused. I&apos;ve picked up on a lot of sexual commentary by Stoker but I&apos;m not getting much in the way of homosexuality. I didn&apos;t make either of those two people explain it to me so do any of you want to try?;</string>
            <string>Evidence of Count Dracula&apos;s homosexuality. Although the Count does not bite Harker when Harker cuts himself shaving, it is pretty obvious that Dracula wants to taste Harker&apos;s blood. There is also the deaths of the men on the Russian ship to consider. The implication is that Dracula killed them on the crossing.  ;Although you are correct that both Lucy and Mina open a window for the vampire to enter, both are semi-conscious at the time. Neither girl seems aware of what is going on. Compare that with the persuasion Dracula uses with Renfield and his willing capitulation.  ;</string>
            <string>I&apos;m so glad you posted this. Here&apos;s my two cents and it&apos;s a doozy!  Retract the fangs and I see a completely different tale, one that was forbidden  for its time period.   This story is about an espoused, respectable, straight man   s submersion into homosexuality.   In the Victorian Era it is improper to talk about sexual encounters, even straight sex. So we get an allegorical account of what happened.   Mr. Harker opens the with person after person telling him that he should turn back, saying what he is trying to do is wrong, waving signs to ward off evil spirits and crossing themselves, yet he continues on.   He hears the words: satan, devil, werewolf, witch, vampire and all sorts of admonishing and still continues on, even going through fire. He literally goes through hell, fire and damnation to get to the door of Castle Dracula and everything in him is urging him to turn back but still willingly enters when asked. This sounds, to me, like folks trying to talk someone out of choosing an alternate lifestyle, even a temporary one or going into a den of iniquity.  Once he accepts the invitation, he and the vampire get to know each other. As they become more intimate, Jonathan feigns innocence (as virgins do) and is apprehensive about proceeding but it   s too late. The trio of women are but another extension of Dracula   s psyche, performing unmentionable or unnatural acts. Men providing nourishment or being nursed on or being penetrated is considered emasculating acts or role reversal.  This new world is very scary and so are the new feelings. Jonathan is ashamed to be excited by what is considered an abomination that is, somehow, sexy.  He wants out but by this time Dracula is falling for him and tries to force him to stay. There&apos;s even a mention of Love. Jonathan  decides that his existence is not what he wants and escapes and then covers his deed with a hasty marriage.   They move on with their lives but his experience is a constant presence in their relationship. Maybe he   s living in the closet or    living on the down low,    as they say. Finally, his desires manifest itself in their bedroom and affects Mina negatively. Dracula   s escape on the Czarina Catherine vessel, while possessing Mina.     This ship is named for a woman known for her promiscuity or as a nymphomaniac. Mina trials could even represent an STD due to Jonathan&apos;s indescretions, some of which can cause infertility.  Jonathan then decides that he can no longer run from who he is and what he did and goes to the root of the problem to cut if off or behead it.   Van Helsing is Jonathan&apos;s concious and helps to restore their relationship. Now that his problem is dead, he and Mina can have a real marriage and start a family. The End.;</string>
            <string>*Minor corrections as advised by peers.*Dracula is an exemplary tale of the indomitable human spirit, overcoming evil or it&apos;s an allegoric reflection of the sexual repression of its day. I chose the latter. In this era, women are defined, not only by gender, but by sexuality. We are offered examples of what society and religion  deems appropriate and inappropriate behavior.  Beware! The vampire, literally and figuratively, is the wolf, come to steal a woman   s virtue, sullying her with a curse of sexual deviance resulting in family destruction; eating babies, killing children and emasculating men.  The affianced Mr. Harker chronicles  a worst case scenario when an enchanting vampire trio attempt to seduce, suckle from and penetrate him. Their dominant, intense sexuality, as well as, his own lustful and unfaithful reactions, are depicted as something to fear. He&apos;s repulsed, rebels and is restored but they appear to revel in the curse and killing and are beheaded.Ignorance is not bliss but rather  anguish in the many accounts of the nubile Westenra. A beautiful, sweet, innocent Lucy is engaged to one, kisses two, wishes she could marry three and shares body fluid with four. Her descent into vampirism parallels her coming of age, slowly transforming her from virgin to vixen. She   s conquered by vampirism, cursed, kills and is beheaded.Meek, maternal, man   s brain, Matron Mina,    one of God   s women fashioned by his own hand.    Though beloved, she&apos;s an asexual presence, no kissing, voluptuousness, sensuality, passion, or physicality. Once infected and unclean, there&apos;s still no sexual awakening. A godly Van Helsing and the devilish vampire battle for Mina and humanity as Dracula is ensconced in the ship of immorality. Dracula is beheaded, Mina is not, the curse passes and she gives life.    The message: flee from the devil like Jonathan, resist him like Mina, and like Van Helsing, do not suffer him to exist and be rewarded with your own happily ever after.;I&apos;ve had comments, positive and negative, as long as my essay. Some are most encouraging, others want to take you down a peg or two, and a few are just plain wrong. It adds to the journey, in my opinion. I learn something new each week, regardless of how it&apos;s presented. Most importantly, I see what not to do when reviewing others.   I&apos;m a perfectionist, always hoping for a 6, so I can handle even cruel constructive criticism if it helps me make it there. I would rather have that than no feedback at all or empty words to satisfy the requirement.  ;</string>
            <string>AminadabCharacter AnalysisAminadab is a total oddball character. There isn&apos;t a whole lot of text devoted to him in &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; but what is there speaks volumes. Hawthorne describes Aminadab as &quot;a man of low stature, but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was grimed with the vapors of the furnace&quot; (26). He is actually a little creepy, if not vaguely sinister. We learn that he isn&apos;t capable of understanding the science behind Aylmer&apos;s work, but that he can execute all the physical details easily. And then, of course, we have the very direct line: With his vast strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the indescribable earthiness that incrusted him, [Aminadab] seemed to represent man&apos;s physical nature; while Aylmer&apos;s slender figure, and pale, intellectual face, were no less apt a type of the spiritual element. (26)That&apos;s our first tip-off that we&apos;re dealing with a symbol here. Aminadab symbolizes man&apos;s earthly, physical half; Aylmer symbolizes man&apos;s lofty, spiritual half. Our second tip-off is his name. &quot;Aminadab&quot; is the name of a high priest in the Bible, so it&apos;s not a stretch to think that Hawthorne&apos;s character is also meant to symbolize men of religion, in contrast to Aylmer, who symbolizes men of science. The first thing we notice is that the man of religion is, in this story, subordinate to the man of science (Aminadab is Aylmer&apos;s servant). This isn&apos;t a value judgment on Hawthorne&apos;s part; rather an observation of the times in which he is living. See both &quot;In a Nutshell&quot; and &quot;Setting,&quot; where we discuss the ideological environment of &quot;The Birthmark&quot; and of Hawthorne&apos;s own time. You&apos;ll see that science was on the rise as compared to religion.At first, it&apos;s hard to reconcile the fact that Hawthorne equates science with loftiness/spirituality (in Aylmer&apos;s character) and religion with earthiness/physicality (in Aminadab&apos;s character). We would expect the opposite: the spiritual man is the religious man, while the earth-bound man is science-driven. But this is not the case. We can understand these associations by recognizing that Hawthorne is interested in a particular kind of scientific inquiry     the kind that, perhaps in Hawthorne&apos;s opinion blasphemously, is built upon man&apos;s spiritual aspirations to conquer nature and become like God. Aylmer isn&apos;t exactly experimenting with pea plants here; he&apos;s trying to remove the symbol of man&apos;s inherent flawed spirit. That&apos;s why science = spiritual.Notice that Aminadab, unlike Aylmer, has no such aspirations. &quot;If she were my wife,&quot; Aminadab says, in his only line of dialogue, &quot;I&apos;d never part with that birthmark&quot; (28). This is the first time we can sense that Aminadab knows something Aylmer doesn&apos;t. He may not be able to follow Aylmer&apos;s science, but when it comes to wisdom, he just might have the edge. To the man of science, becoming God is a lofty and noble goal. But to Aminadab, it is blasphemous, impossible, and certainly unwise to try.The last thing to talk about here is that laugh at the end of the text. When it becomes apparent that the birthmark is fading from Georgiana&apos;s cheek, Aylmer hears &quot;a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant Aminadab&apos;s expression of delight&quot; (85). We hear nothing more from the Aminadab until Georgiana dies; then &quot;a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again!&quot; (91). We see that religion has triumphed over science in that Hawthorne&apos;s tale has proved the foolishness of trying to become God; religion, despite having been made into a servant by science, has the last laugh     literally.But the reader can&apos;t safely take Aminadab&apos;s side here; in one sense, we&apos;re right back to where we started with that slightly sinister tinge to his character. He laughs at Georgiana&apos;s death. In this way, Hawthorne complicates his story considerably. He&apos;s certainly questioning the wisdom of letting scientific inquiry drive our entire ideology; but he&apos;s certainly not so positive about religion, either.http://www.shmoop.com/birthmark/aminadab.html;</string>
            <string>I have read most Oscar Wilde biographies - notably Richard Ellmann&apos;s Oscar Wilde and Neil McKenna&apos;s The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde - and the only reason Bram Stoker is mentioned in these works is because the young Wilde had a crush on Bram Stoker&apos;s future wife Florence Balcombe. There is no homosexual connection between these two men. But then I have not read anything on the life and personality of Stoker. Does someone have some concrete information on Stoker in that regard? Was he   a closet homosexual? I think the whole issue is nonsense unless you convince me otherwise.;</string>
            <string>Now to me that&apos;s the height of laziness.   I&apos;ve read some essays where I feel the writer wrote   it in haste or just didn&apos;t care.;Great responses guys.   I didn&apos;t realize Shelley wrote Frankenstein in one night.   And, had it published which even back then was probably hard to do.   I guess I need to research these authors before I criticize them.   I&apos;m getting a little more into it now after reading 100 pages.;I agree with you Ratka.   A lot of these people need to learn what &quot;constructive&quot; criticism is.   I&apos;m having the same problem.   The scores keep getting worse instead of better.   But, I&apos;m not quitting.   Thought about it, but that isn&apos;t going to help me learn either.   I think I&apos;ll wait until the end of the course to look at the evaluations.   Otherwise, it will make me feel worse.   Specially if you work hard on the essays.;I&apos;ve written three essays in this course and each time my grade has gone down 1/2 a point.   Each time I try harder to improve but it gets worse instead of better.   I&apos;m confused.;Tee hee.   You&apos;re funny Anonymous.   Makes me feel better.   The drink sounds like a good idea.;I object to other students doing the grading cause many of them probably don&apos;t have any experience on grading papers and don&apos;t know what they are doing.   I can take constructive criticism well and trying not to take it too seriously.;My scores so far have been 4, 3.5, and 3.;That&apos;s a great idea Emma.   We probably will not make everyone happy.   I don&apos;t care if I get a perfect score, but my writing is better than these people are saying.   (I have a bachelor degree in public relations.)   I&apos;ve shown the essays to my husband and he says they are fine.   And, I think he would tell me the truth.;I tend to think &quot;outside&quot; the box more than most people.   Especially in my writing.   I do know also, that most people read at the 8th grade level (sad).   I guess I&apos;ll succumb and start writing at that level.   (Unfortunately, that could be the problem, tee hee.);To Anonymous (not native speaker)   I feel you are so BRAVE to take this class when English is not your first language.   I admire and respect you for that.   Keep doing what you are doing and you will be fine.   :);Lauren, ooooo, I like that idea.   Thanks.   I&apos;ll probably do that.;This is an off topic post, but what are the points for on the original posts?   Just curious.;I feel 320 words isn&apos;t enough to do a decent essay.   And having a limit is a problem.   The best I can do is a summary or synopsis.   600 words would be better.   Just a thought.;</string>
            <string>My boyfriend, who is also taking this course, chose sexualism for his Alice&apos;s essay, and got bad grades. One of our peers said &quot;you can&apos;t think about sexualism while reading Alice, it&apos;s a children&apos;s book and it represents innocence.&quot;. I actually read his essay, and it was pretty good. He exposed and argumented everything correctly, giving a new point of view about the story. I feel sorry for these close-mind people.;</string>
            <string>Yeah, I hated the intro to Justine.   It was too ridiculous to overlook.;</string>
            <string>I have done a little research into the idea that Mina is a representation of a goddess and I find that she most resembles Nepthys. There are several aspects of Nepthys that seem to resonate with Mina&apos;s character and role in the story. Check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephthys ;You might be interested in the fact that Prof Rabkin has offered this material elsewhere. He has a book: Fantastic Worlds: Myths, Tales, and Stories by Eric S. Rabkin and also a video series: Masterpieces of the Imaginative Mind: Literature   s Most Fantastic Works. So you don&apos;t have to stay in the course just to get the upcoming material.;</string>
            <string>One of the essays I have to evaluate is a copy of the Wikipedia page  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula. How do I assess this? Even if the participant is not the author, the page itself meets all the requirements for this cursus...Any advice?;</string>
            <string>i could not finish my reading to write my essay.;</string>
            <string>I think you&apos;ll find that &quot;de&quot; in this context means &quot;of&quot;. So it would be &quot;flight of death&quot;, which makes even more sense!  ;When I think of the death-eaters and that he sought the death wand and its power over other people&apos;s lives, I believe that he was a &quot;flight of death.&quot; I think you are forgetting that immortality to Tom Riddle was a means to an end - namely an undead dictator who led by fear, not love. His image was meant to be terrible and not necessarily convey his desire for immortality, because in a way, he already had it. This is actually more similar to Dracula. Both had immortality and had to be whittled down first before destruction.Remember, that immortality is something Tom Riddle already had by the time he took the name Voldemort.  ;Excellent point. If I could revise my earlier assessment, I would say that Voldemort both feared death and wished to wield it as weapon. His earlier focus on horcruxes was replaced before the final battle with his search for the death wand. What was his motivation for this search? Because in so wielding, he would be immortal? Perhaps he believed that, but as we know from the story, all three brothers died because of their gifts. I am now wondering if his violent actions were intended to create a kind of horrific immortality upon the minds of muggles and magic-born alike.I feel like I need to re-read Riddle&apos;s earlier life in The Half-Blood Prince again. I just remember so much of the last book, but perhaps there are deeper motivations I neglected. I still think of Tom as that crying baby who inflicted his pain on others, very similar to Hitler, Napoleon and other similar ambitious world dictators.;A final point is that there is no immortality of physical form, even for the gods. Destruction can always occur as in the case of Dracula and Voldemort. Immortality is a dream with so many caveats so as to not be in itself immortality. Being perpetuated in history or converted to another form is a type of immortality, but not in keeping with the dream as I understand it.Is immortality the same as invincibility? After all, even those who are invincible may be subject to forces outside of human control, such as time or gravity.;Although I though Dracula overlong, the sexual puns, suggestions that both Arthur and Jonathan were cockolds, and the ridiculous justifications of what it means to be male or female has me in stitches.Throughout the entire time, I was wondering if this was merely a modernist view of Dracula and NOT what a contemporary Victorian audience would have seen.Two incidents of particular were of note to me. When Nina is walking back with Lucy, she makes a point to cover her feet in mud, so that from a distance it will look to a passerby that she is wearing shoes. Isn&apos;t that a bit extreme and laughable? And then of course, the first visit of Lucy&apos;s tomb, the &quot;sperm&quot; from Van Helsing&apos;s candle drips onto her face plate. As I understand it, there may have been something about whale sperm used in the wax of candles then, but still, isn&apos;t this an outward display of a lecherous old man?For me, the puns and allegory was so suggestive, that like reading Romeo and Juliet, I could help but laugh rather than being frightened by Dracula.;</string>
            <string>I have to say that I agree that Professor Rabkin was a bit extreme in his assessment. Especially since we have so many Victor Frankenstein&apos;s around. Honestly, there is nothing that suggests to me that he should have compounded his creation by creating a female version. How was that supposed to work... I mean, really?! The movies that convey a Mrs. Frankenstein Monster are accurate, I think. She would kill herself...that the male counterpart doesn&apos;t suggests more selfishness than Victor ever did.Victor is self-absorbed, but his situation has become that of the modern man. Most of us sacrifice technology for a personal connection to someone. The fact we are taking an online class is proof enough of that. I&apos;ve also thought of Frankenstein as less a morality play (because the moral is way too transparent) and more of an allegory. The parallels between Victor and his monster are startling and I&apos;m surprised in bringing up Forbidden Planet, Professor Rabkin failed to mention how the monster represents Victor&apos;s id or super-ego, depending on his state.;I understand where you&apos;re coming from, but his creature&apos;s wish is anything but modest. I appreciate that few have any sympathy for Frankenstein, but for the same reason, you should have little sympathy for the murderous monster he created.Two points. Victor did everything he could for Justine. If he told the truth, it would be a wild story. And just like in the real world, it is almost impossible to overcome a murder&apos;s confession, no matter what her intention. I really cannot comprehend this critique of Victor. Criticize him for isolating himself at Ingolstadt in his studies, leaving the monster immediately after its creation or any other number of issues, but Justine&apos;s death is an unavoidable consequence of his monster.As for &quot;modest wish&quot;, Victor already lost two people to the monster&apos;s rage and you believe those deaths should be rewarded? If we are to make the monster a child (which his speech and thought processes are certainly nothing like a child&apos;s), then he should be punished and being too powerful to punish, perhaps destroyed. Would Victor be more sympathetic if he destroyed his monster with some clever trick? I think Mary Shelley intentionally had Victor as spineless, so that the tragedy could play its way through like a classic Greek tragedy. But I cannot see how giving him a woman would have satiated him. As a woman, Mary Shelley knew that there is no such thing as &quot;giving someone a woman&apos;, because you cannot guarantee love or satisfaction. And would sex even be possible with no hope of procreation? Would that please the monster or would he come killing more people for getting the power to procreate over time? How much is enough for such a powerful, unstoppable creature?;Isn&apos;t that the interesting bit? Neither Victor nor his monster are a complete person. Victor is able to give life, but cannot take it, while the monster deals death with no ability to procreate. It is a tragic divorce that suggests separating Victor from his creation is not an answer to the questions brought up in the story.;I think this a valid critique of Victor - he is mentally imbalanced, almost unhinged in his sanity. Constantly he doubts reality and what is happening to him. This makes for passages filled with self-doubt, suggesting he is a poor choice of narrator. He does try to reason with authorities, but he knows, just like we do, that there is no way to save Justine. No one would believe him that a monster he created was clever enough to plant a locket in revenge of its creator! This plea rarely works with humans much less anything else. What you are reading in the narrative is how Victor uses Justine&apos;s trial as a sense of horror rather than a detailed blow-by-blow courtroom drama. Do you really think Mary Shelley intended us to condemn Victor for Justine or that she just wanted the natural chain of tragedy to impact him?;I appreciate that viewpoint and no doubt Professor Rabkin does, too. I do not think it is wrong, just not my opinion. I do not like Victor, but to criticize him so heavily as to claim that is the moral point of the novel I cannot agree with. The problem with Victor is that he creates a monster, but has no capacity or ability to parent it. I think the point is not that others couldn&apos;t have tried more ways to love it, but that as humans with the right to create, we are inherently selfish creatures, able to create life but genetically questionable in protecting it. It is easy to criticize Victor until you realize that some of his behaviors actually hit home. It is his creation that rips his life asunder, not him. I agree that Victor&apos;s poor relationships may have provided touchpoints for the monster, but it is the monster and Victor&apos;s inability to understand and control it.I have often seen the monster as the symbol of industrialization and innovation. How often have we created something only to find that we have no control of how it is used, misused and possibly tears our contemporary existence apart? Ultimately, you may hate Victor, but his pain is ours as well, no matter our best intentions.;Ultimately, we are to feel sympathy for both Victor and his monster, but never to lose sight of the shortcomings of both. They both are examples of how NOT to be and BOTH of them are warnings for us all.;An interesting article I&apos;d thought to share...  http://kaylathetheoxenophile.wordpress.com/professional-readings/a-literary-criticism-on-nathaniel-hawthornes-dr-heideggers-experiment-using-a-formalistic-approach-centered-on-deciphering-studied-texts-symbols-to-find-its-speci/ I agree with its conclusion ... do you?   Yes, Dr. Heidegger   s main purpose in doing the experiment is to test whether these sinful people will do the same mistake if given a chance to turn young again or not. And what this paper suggests as to what mistake is the love of physical beauty and admiration of what is only pleasant.  ;</string>
            <string>I got a 4 on my essay and I&apos;m pretty sure I deserved something closer to a 5. One of my reviewers had comments like this:   hello, first I apologize because English is not my native language. this essay I find something hard to understand because it uses examples that go beyond reading actually, despite being interesting, I think is a little out of focus, objectivity is not clear, since neither refers in conclusion to the story or the characters, or his narrative. rather it is a mixture of all three, so for me it is not so digestible without being bad I think it is very clear. actually is for me difficult to understand, perhaps for new readings quoted do not know, but is sensitive to the way shown, speaks of Hawthorne, but I remain poe side that does not name ever.  I wrote on how Rappaccinni&apos;s Daughter demonstrates a classic femme fatale archetype. I&apos;m very frustrated how peer reviews alone are assignments, especially with these off-the-wall peer reviews, I have little faith in the system without some kind of process to challenge illegitimate peer reviews. I don&apos;t even care if this person gave me two 3s (which I doubt), the comments depict someone completely clueless. ;You both make excellent points, but as an instructional designer, I find the unchecked system inherently unfair. I took another class with peer reviews, but we also had individual quizzes. I have no idea why this class is only peer reviews. Also, the score system was a wider range (I think it was three elements for a total of 9). I&apos;m not sure this takes the median or the average. If it&apos;s average, then this is a very flawed way to do peer review.I honestly feel like a peer should take a basic quiz before they can review another student&apos;s work or we should be able to mark a review for comment or something. Maybe we all get six reviews and we can determine one to drop or something.;</string>
            <string>Sometimes I feel the same as you did, Nancy. The comments given to my essays are sometimes unclear and contradictory but there are also times when everyone pointed out the same problem I have. Anyway, maybe it&apos;s best to accept some of those suggestions and ignore the others. You can never satisfy everyone at the same time, so just be the best of whatever you are.;The monster had tried so hard to seek a human companion without any success. Maybe it&apos;s just because his appearance is too unacceptable. Remember what the blind old man in the cottage said? &quot;I am blind, and cannot judge  of your countenance, but there is something in your words, which  persuades me that you are sincere.&quot;The monster wanted to be loved and cared, but none of the human beings would do so. Even his creator abandoned him. In the end, he had to ask for a companion of the same species. Yet his last request was turned down so he took revenge on us humans.He is just too lonely. Maybe it&apos;s our fault from the beginning. We judge people by appearance too much.;</string>
            <string>Unless I&apos;m mistaken, the monster ALWAYS did what he said he would do.Frankenstein vacillated and agonized and hesitated and flip-flopped, and promised something crucial but then went back on his promise. The creature, in his own bizarre way, seemed almost more ethical than the human.   ;The suit the monster is wearing in that Hugh Grant movie is pretty impressively well-tailored -- considering the creature is meant to be 8 feet tall...     ;With my Frankensteinian images formed largely through movies, I had always thought of the monster as a big, doltish creature who moved with the clunkiness of a rusted robot and had a more or less monosyllabic vocabulary of grunts and snarls, at best.   So it came as quite a surprise to read Shelley&apos;s depiction of an incredibly articulate being -- fond of Goethe, Plutarch and Milton -- who is not only huge and powerful but tremendously well-spoken and as graceful as an athlete. So, which image serves the story better? Obviously, the monster would not have been able to reason, beg, argue and plead with its maker as effectively had it been limited to a childlike vocabulary. And I suppose we&apos;re to think its pain at the cold rejection by humans is all the more keenly felt, given its intelligence?   The movie version, on the other hand, can perhaps better convey a sort of noble-savage image, a simple being frustrated by its limitations (though if he existed today, the NBA would love to get its hands on him!)   and by human rejection.What does anyone think?   ;Solitude is also an interesting theme when you compare/contrast this book to &quot;Dracula&quot; -- where a major theme was the constructive collaboration of a team of smart, competent -- and pretty level-headed -- people to find a solution to a frightening, existential threat.   ;Terrific observation, Elizabeth!   There&apos;s no doubt that the weather affects our mood and our outlook on life, and a cold, gray, weirdly abnormal summer like that would be bound to affect someone as sensitive as Shelley evidently was.   Thanks for pointing this out.;Actually,   there WERE other witnesses, at least if we take Frankenstein at his word:   &quot;Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.&quot;  ;Shelley devotes pages and pages and pages to the monster telling his story, all leading up to his request that Frankenstein make him a mate -- then in a few sentences, F. says no and the monster goes dashing angrily down the mountainside. She spends chapter after chapter describing F&apos;s change of heart and his final decision to make a &quot;bride&quot; for the monster, followed by his long, circuitous   trip to England and thence to his ocean-side laboratory -- then, in the course of a sentence or two, when the monster suddenly appears to watch, F. changes his mind and instantly destroys the work-in-progress (by the way, it&apos;s not hard to understand how F. could have found plenty of body parts in the big city -- but out there in the middle of nowhere??).   I just find the pacing horrible. It&apos;s all-or-nothing, either agonizingly slow, or else agonizingly fast -- the only constant being the agonizing part. I think Shelley needed a good (patient, talented) editor. Anyone else? ;Well, maybe &quot;pacing&quot; wasn&apos;t exactly the right word.   What I was trying to get at was that after a LOOOONG, drawn-out build-up,   Shelley reaches a point of climax but just seems to breeze past it without fully explaining, describing or elaborating how and why things happen.   It seems, for example, that just a glimpse of the monster as Frankenstein was working on the &quot;bride&quot; was enough to make him throw away months and months of work and planning in a moment.     Maybe it was just me, but I felt under-served.   It was if the candle she was working by was burning down to its final few flickers and she knew she had to wrap things up quickly.   I wanted more.    ;Oxana, that&apos;s absolutely relevant to Frankenstein.   During the creature&apos;s months in the shack up in the mountains, he fully convinces himself that because he loves and appreciates the family on the other side of the wall, and has nothing but the warmest and most complete admiration for them, and plans to approach them in a peaceful and loving manner, he can expect the same from them.   But oh, cruel world, twas not meant to be... ;So, I&apos;m not entirely sure I follow your very interesting and provocative comments, but you&apos;re saying that if he were alive today, the Frankenstein monster might fit in nicely in a corporate board room?   ;)   ;</string>
            <string>He apparently wrote this after serving several years in a Siberian labor camp. ;I see the point, but I&apos;m not sure I agree.   Sure, getting up-votes is nice, but on a site like this, and in a class like this, I&apos;m striving to find something fresh, intelligent and original to say,   not to impress a would-be date or gain some advantage in a gaming-type environment. Sure, ideally it might be better if we were all sitting in a classroom, could look one another in the eye and interact on an actual human basis -- but where are you going to find a classroom that can hold 50,000 students, from 100 countries, speaking 20 different languages and showing up at every time of day and night? Perverse?   I don&apos;t think so. ;Good discussion.   A question:   I thought it was sickening that Victor allowed the innocent Justine to die without raising a finger to prevent it, but was he not right that any attempt to explain it   would simply have resulted in his being branded as a madman? Should he not have tried anyway?   Perhaps he could have invented a story about some other culprit to at least throw suspicion away from Justine? (Although the plot, it&apos;s true, relies partly on his bearing the enormous burden of guilt over her death, and Williams&apos;...) ;</string>
            <string>Thank you for your insight Greg, but I&apos;m not really unhappy with the score.   I was unhappy with the comments made regarding the essay.   They were not intended to be helpful but rather seemed designed to be discouraging.    The sarcasm wasn&apos;t appropriate.Thank you again for your comments.;Thanks! :D;</string>

            <string>Brilliant!   Thank you for sharing. :);One of the essays I&apos;m currently marking has FOUR short stories that are not part of the course syllabus. :S;Off-topic: What about those who have used Wikipedia entries or study guides (SparkNotes, Shmoop, CliffNotes)?   They are definitely not a source of literary criticism.;Thank you kindly for the replies.;Agreed.;</string>
            <string>hi hi all I create facebook page,which we can join,discuss and meet with each other. hope see you in pagethis  is a kinda page for coursera student in Bay area or even for California  state, the page is not limited ,even from other part of  the word we can share idea, but those who live in North California ESP  Bay area could meet up. hope see u all face to face https://www.facebook.com/groups/188655667962362/;</string>
            <string>Well, the religion part is quite obvious, starting with the &quot;protective&quot; crucifix handed to Harker by a fellow passenger just before he meets the Count&apos;s carriage.;</string>
            <string>As a psychologist I&apos;m very interested in meaning of myths and fairy tales. If you know some good literature regarding this subject (beside Bruno Bettelheim) pleas post here. ;</string>
            <string>Yeah I&apos;ve found that&apos;s a very common problem in Coursera classes, obviously worse in this one since it relies so heavily on that feature.Still, I would stick it out for the lectures and interpretations by the professor, they&apos;re very interesting. Besides, keep writing and maybe you&apos;ll get better peer responses next time. A lot of people just don&apos;t give much thought to the evaluation phase.;</string>
            <string>I have to agree with William here. Sometimes it&apos;s fun and appropriate to read and interpret a novel at an only superficial level. After all, maybe what the author meant to do was tell a story, without any subliminal allegories or symbols. However, at least when I signed up in this course I figured (correctly) that it would be mostly about literally analyzing (as in dissecting) the story to find as many ulterior meanings as possible. A lot of people don&apos;t like that, but in many cases, I think it allows us to see deeper, different layers to the writing.;In the last video in this unit,  Some Thoughts on Love, Professor Rabkin says Victor destroyed his &quot;Monster&apos;s&quot; bride because he was small-minded, petty and mean. Does anyone else think he&apos;s being a bit too rough on Frankenstein&apos;s character?I think Victor&apos;s concerns were genuine regarding the creature&apos;s potential children (that they would come to loathe and attack humanity), even if they were founded on his unjust hatred of his creation and therefore misguided. In that sense, his purported reason for destroying his bride seemed to me sincere. Of course, Frankenstein was precipitated and irresponsible for hating his &quot;Monster&quot; so profoundly, but I believe his intentions were not, essentially, evil or mean-spirited.Moreover, Professor Rabkin dismisses his character as egotistical and, in a sense, incapable of love. I have to disagree with him here too; his love at least towards Elizabeth, his father and his fondness for Clerval, though probably of a selfish nature, seemed authentic. As did, I should say, his ability to profoundly and poignantly admire the wonders of nature.What do you guys think?;You&apos;re missing the point. The professor makes him out to be a sociopath, I just don&apos;t think he was, in essence, evil. Egotistical certainly, grossly misguided absolutely, and vain to boot. But not, I would say, evil. I think Walton&apos;s admiration of him was not completely misplaced. He got caught up in his fervor for knowledge and discovery, and had a thrifty moral compass throughout, besides being a horrid judge of character with his creation. However, consider this: he was not a murderer, thief or defiler (at least, not a defiler of the living, and of the dead only for an episode after which he realized how horrifying his actions were).In fact, his list of serious crimes amount to three things, none of which measure up in severity to his creation&apos;s murders: firstly, being irresponsible, prejudicial and mean-spirited to his  &quot;Monster&quot;  from the get-go; secondly, allowing Justine to hang without earnestly attempting to provide reasonable doubt as a testifying witness; and finally, destroying the creation&apos;s bride and his only hope of happiness. But again, I think this was a result of being misguided and reserved in his judgment, precisely because of selfishness, and not because he was &quot;evil&quot;.;Javier, his actions against the monster were, well... monstrous. But I mean it&apos;s not like Frankenstein was completely unjustified in believing that his creation could be, to some extent, evil. He  did murder an innocent boy and frame an innocent woman. My sympathy to the monster extended as far as his first murder in cold blood, as would be the case, I think, with any other figure, fictional or real. In this sense, killing (or rather, not finishing) the creature&apos;s bride was not an act of mere pettiness or meanness.;Well, to be fair, Frankenstein did try to sway the judges (&quot;my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them&quot;). If he had told the truth, he would probably have been branded a madman, like he thought. He could have made something up about witnessing something suspicious, but as he was not even in Geneva when the murder occurred they probably would have thought he was making it up to defend Justine, whom the judges knew he was fond of.I know it seems like I&apos;m defending Frankenstein, and in a way, I suppose I am; it just seems to me a lot of people berate him way too harshly. He certainly was not blameless, but remember, he wasn&apos;t the one who murdered William, Elizabeth or Clerval, and I think it&apos;s unlikely, in any case, that he could have saved Justine, whose death really lies in the hands of the creature that framed her.;</string>
            <string>For those of you in the NY area, there is a fantastical, immersive dance-theater production called &quot;Then She Fell&quot; at 2 Kingsland Ave in Williamsburg, Bklyn. Only 15 people attend each performance and are given   a personal tour of a   Wonderland/mental hospital populated by the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen, the White Queen, the White Rabbit, Lewis Carroll, and two Alices. Note- You must be 21 to attend- all the concoctions you are offered are alcoholic.You are given a set of keys and encouraged to explore the locked drawers and cabinets of the enchanting Victorian rooms in the three story building. You may not open any doors, and may speak only when spoken to during the two-hour experience. All your senses are engaged   and the experience feels dream-like, dark, and sensual as you are pulled from room to room.  At the Mad Hatter&apos;s tea party,I had tea with several actors and three fellow theater goers. The plates were flying and ,of course, we had to keep changing chairs so the Mad Hatter could have a clean cup.Everyone has a different experience. While my friend   painted a white rose red, Lewis Carroll had me take dictation for a letter to Alice.While another attendee had to win a card game to procure a special golden key, I had to win a shell game to receive my key. The actors were amazing.Please don&apos;t miss this if you have the opportunity- I think this was as close as I will ever come to falling down the rabbithole and experiencing Wonderland.;</string>
            <string>I took a philosophy course and the teacher tought us this phrase that I always remember: what is done by one single man can actually be done by every man. This potential is inside the human nature, the rules and moral decided by the community are what can influence the behaviour. The creature is left alone with no one to teach how to survive. I think the autor wants us also to reflect on this and how the creature is judged evil by its appearence. Finally he  identify himself as evil to have an identity which is recognized by the others. To exist.;</string>
            <string>I am absolutely loving this course. The readings are great and I like to put effort on the essays and peer reviews. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;m out of an academic environment and it&apos;s thrilling to do the work and see how my brain copes with having to find interesting ideas for the writing assignments.However, I have an issue. I am going on holiday for two weeks and I am not going to be able to hand in essays or assignments. I feel bad about this. I don&apos;t know how it impacts on the grade but that&apos;s the least of my worries. I just really want to have the whole experience.So lately I have been thinking on un-enrolling and signing up to the October edition of the course. I have already 3 essays which I guess I could re-use and this way I could get ahead on the reading. But this also kind of seems like giving up. What do you guys reckon?;</string>
            <string>The homosexual theory is supported by the obvious chemistry and sexual tension between Walton and Frankenstein in the beginning.Apart from that however, I don&apos;t really agree with the fact that the monster doesn&apos;t exist. I like to interpret this as a science fiction novel which expresses the fear of technology&apos;s impact on our society and our survival.Saying the monster didn&apos;t exist is like saying that the machines weren&apos;t really harvesting the humans for energy in the Matrix (first movie) and that Keanu Reeves was just hallucinating. Both interpretations work, but the latter robs the story of its meaning.;I&apos;m sorry to say that I thought both were pretty monotone. I thank god that Shelley at least had a better vocabulary. Whenever Stoker had to describe something positive he used the words &apos;good&apos;, &apos;sweet&apos;, &apos;pretty&apos; and &apos;pure&apos; no matter who the narrator. He even once described Mina as &apos;good, good, sweet, sweet&apos; as if by repeating the same words he somehow made it better. As for the vampires, the only word he used to describe them was &apos;voluptuous&apos;.Shelley has a better grasp over basic descriptions but nuanced characters and the power of suggestion seem to be beyond both their powers.;Your idea is very interesting. I don&apos;t really agree with it, mainly because I didn&apos;t see Shelley at any time even hint that this possibility is something she considered worth exploring. However, I see what you are driving at. The great similarity in the stories of the creator and creation can be an indication of a split personality. I mean:- Victor has intellectual passion that results in a discovery that results in monster.- Monster has academic inclinations that result in its question of identity that result in its anger.- Monster&apos;s anger results in victor&apos;s anger (death of William) and fear.- Victor&apos;s anger brings destruction upon Monster&apos;s bride.- Monster&apos;s anger brings destruction upon Victor.They have a symbiotic relationship going on. It literally looks like they feed off of each others passions. This could Victor&apos;s convoluted way of not taking responsibility for the deaths. He could attribute his creation of the monster to intellectual curiosity and the destruction of the bride to saving the planet from a new species. This would justify all the murders in the novel. I mean sure, he would feel bad and blame himself, but in his heart of hearts, he would know that he couldn&apos;t have done anything to stop that monster. It could be for this comfort that he creates this monster, as a thing to take the fall for his own misconducts. I don&apos;t entirely believe this, but its possible.What I find much more interesting is the suggestion that knowledge leads to misery. By the monster&apos;s own admission, its knowledge of human affairs was what led it to question its own identity, existence, and loneliness, thus ultimately leading to its grief. Frankenstein&apos;s acquisition of an amazing scientific advancement was what sealed his fate. Now, i am not a Christian, so I don&apos;t know if this is true, but in Ender&apos;s Shadow by Orson Scott Card, there is a biblical allusion to the tree of knowledge vs the tree of life. The implication (in the novel) is that superior powers of intellect must be compensated for by a shorter life. However, Mary Shelley goes way beyond this. She equates life to eros (life-force or sexual instinct) exhibited in Victor&apos;s act of creation and the monster&apos;s desire for a wife. Due to the consumption of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the eros is converted to thanatos which is:  &quot;the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state&quot;. This is exhibited by Victor tearing up the monster&apos;s bride as well as the monster&apos;s murders. More disturbingly, Victor&apos;s pursuit of knowledge, the creation of the monster, threatened the logos, or the rationality principle. The monster&apos;s framing of Justine and its misuse of its knowledge of our justice system (note the similarity of the name Justine to justice) causes Elizabeth to begin to doubt in the integrity and fairness of the justice system. The monster begins to sow the seeds of anarchy, upsetting the smooth rationality of the current institutions.Thanatos is associated with counter-intuitive or unnatural behavior (such as the historical events the monster studied about). Murder definitely qualifies as both. Mary Shelley has repeatedly shown how the thirst for knowledge results in the unnatural and the grotesque. Although Frankenstein is a science fiction novel, rather than heralding the future, it shies away from it. In the novel, science is seen as something which disturbs the balance and progress as endangering the status quo. Any form of change (both social and evolutionary) is seen with fear. I find this regressive knowledge vs life attitude to be the central conflict of this novel, and in today&apos;s context, I think that this view is completely outdated. Right now, innovation is the only way to solve the world&apos;s problems. Retreating to the Swiss Alps and acting as if the industrial revolution never occurred isn&apos;t going to help. Neither are novels like Frankenstein.;I felt the same about the destruction of the bride. What I found even more annoying were the huge descriptions of natural beauty that seemed to have no bearing on the novel. I love huge descriptions when they are actually there for a purpose, such as symbolism or atmosphere (like in H P Lovecraft) but when they are repetitive scenes of beauty which serve no purpose other than to reiterate the protagonists despondency for the millionth time, I get kinda pissed off!;I think that large vision is never an excuse for shoddy craftsmanship. A writer cannot be a great artist with a brilliant story and no technique. The novel which suffers from this defect cannot be a great novel.;I think Frankenstein recoils from the monster because he is his own creation. Creation in the 19th century was attributed to God and the idea of man having the power to grant life must have been considered horrific. It is this belief which branded Frankenstein, his otherness caused by the identity of his creator. Before he was animated, Frankenstein&apos;s bench-mark of beauty must have been sculpture or works of art. However, after giving him life, Victor has challenged God and therefore, since man is inferior to God, his creation must also be inferior to God&apos;s creation. On animation, the bench-mark shifts to the perfection of the human form, and the monster falls short due to the human identity of his creator.;</string>

            <string>This possibility that the monster might actually be Frankenstein was in the back of my mind as I read the novel. It seemed odd to me that there had been no other eyewitness accounts of the monster until the end of the novel. I agree that to say that Shelley thought the monster and Victor were the same is a bit of a stretch and requires overanalysis. However, you might be able to make this interpretation hold water by suggesting that by the end of the novel, Victor becomes the monster, thus explaining the eyewitness accounts later on.  ;</string>

            <string>I read the post as if we&apos;re supposed to read the entire volumes: Mosses of an Old Manse and Twice-Told Tales. I wrote my essay about &quot;The Bosom Serpent&quot; and &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; since they were both in Mosses of an Old Manse.   I could never find where the required Poe readings were listed. The syllabus said that all the required stories are in The Portable Poe, so I assumed we were responsible for reading the entire collection. Where were these stories listed?;I&apos;m glad you posted this thread. I&apos;m a little bit unclear about exactly what oedipal structure entails. When Professor Rabkin talks about it he says that we&apos;re not talking about Freudian version of the Oedipus complex, but rather, we&apos;re referring to the actual myth of King Oedipus. I failed to see how the &quot;generational struggle&quot; was a major component of the original myth. King Oedipus was never fighting for his wife&apos;s affections; he was awarded them because he defeated the Sphinx. It would be nice if someone could provide a simple definition of oedipal structure because I&apos;m still a bit confused. Thank you.  ;I had the same experience. Evaluators took of points because they claimed that we were only supposed to read the Hawthorne stories specifically named on the syllabus. I believe they are mistaken. I wrote my essay about &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and &quot;The Bosom Serpents,&quot; two stories from Mosses of an Old Manse.   I thought the syllabus said we are responsible for all the stories in Mosses of an Old Manse, Twice-Told Tales, and The Portable Poe. I know that&apos;s a lot to read, but so far the bar has been set pretty high for this course&apos;s workload.  ;Anyway, this is what I originally thought, but I stand corrected. There is a separate section that denotes the specific readings:  In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne&apos;s &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment,&quot; and &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;; Poe&apos;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; &quot;The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Oval Portrait,&quot; &quot;The Facts in the Case of M.

I discussed &quot;The Bosom Serpents,&quot; not the &quot;Tell-Tale Heart.&quot; I&apos;m really disappointed with myself that I didn&apos;t analyze the assigned stories for this essay. I could have just as easily used &quot;The Birthmark&quot; and &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter&quot; to support my thesis.  Oh well.  I&apos;ve  decided to post my essay  in case you&apos;re interested in reading it. Enjoy.  In  Doctor Who, a British science fiction drama,  the lead character suggests that both    the devil    and the    things that men do    are the same thing in the end. Although Hawthorne did not believe these ideas were entirely the same, his writings show a greater concern for the    things that men do    because of evil&apos;s ubiquitous nature.  Even though Hawthorne personally believed in the existence of a devil, his journal entries never explored the nature of Satan.   When his stories gave evil a physical form, the forms were metaphorical. For example, in    Young Goodman Brown    Satan bears a    considerable resemblance    to the protagonist and has the same    rank and file.    By drawing this comparison, Hawthorne wants the reader to think about the evils inside of Brown   s own heart. By the end of the story Goodman Brown himself becomes the most frightful thing in the forest. Hawthorne turns the reader&apos;s attention to the evil that every human is capable of.  We see this again in    Egotism,    when the sin of pride appears as one   s own personal snake. Even though the Bible has portrayed Satan as a snake, the serpent here does not represent Satan but rather reflects Hawthorne   s own personal belief of original sin.   This idea is supported through Roderick   s suggestion that there   s    poisonous stuff in any man   s heart to generate a brood of serpents.   Rosina confirms the metaphorical nature of the serpent when she says that    what it typified is as shadowy as itself.     The greatest danger to Hawthorne was looking at other   s sins without acknowledging the evil lurking within. It   s just like the narrator of    Young Goodman Brown    says:    The fiend is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man.    For Hawthorne, the fiend wasn   t some noisy beast devouring souls; she was the sultry voice already inside our heads     distorting our self-concepts.  Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

I&apos;ve been doing some research to try to find out what Hawaiian or Pacific Island tradition this refers to. We know that it must be a Pacific Island tradition because Dr. Moreau mentions in chapter 14 that the  Kalaka people are the ones who educated the gorilla. I find it a very strange coincidence that the Shaka sign that surfers use today  demonstrates 3 missing fingers just as the gorilla&apos;s gesture does. Is there a correlation here? As far as I can tell, the history of the Shaka sign only dates back to the 1950s, nearly a century after Wells wrote The Island of Dr. Moreau. It&apos;s possible that some portion the Shaka sign&apos;s history has been forgotten. Maybe there was a protosymbol that predated the Shaka sign that time has forgotten. If anyone could shed some light on this issue, I might actually be able to sleep tonight. I&apos;m dying to figure this out. Here is  what is already known about the history of the  Shaka sign: think:  http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/7837-the-history-of-the-famous-surfing-shaka-sign;Here is the passage I was referring to:  [The Gorilla] seemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held his own hand out and counted his digits slowly,    One, two, three, four, five     eigh?    I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. Then his  swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift movement     and vanished.Perhaps I was mistaken to call this a &quot;greeting&quot; because now that I read it again, I see that Edward, once he discovered that it was common for these Beast People to be missing up to 3 fingers, no longer thinks it&apos;s a greeting. Nevertheless, I am still convinced this gesture has a meaning. The gorilla responds to the sign with &quot;immense satisfaction.&quot; This tells me that the symbol has some sort of personal meaning to the gorilla, perhaps even to the Kalaka people who trained him as well.;Hello everyone! I thought it would be fun to discuss adaptations of our required readings as well explicit or implicit references to those works. Also, if you see themes or ideas we&apos;ve discussed in the course such as the Eden Complex or oedipal structure elsewhere in modern culture, you can mention those here as well.      ;I just watched a film adaptation of The Island of Dr. Moreau. The film is from 1932, and it&apos;s called  The Island of Lost Souls. It was very well-written and the acting was decent, albeit melodramatic by today&apos;s standards. You can watch the film for free on Youtube:    http://youtu.be/_v1fMrQgrdkAlso, was anyone out there a fan of the TV show Fringe? A big component of season 4 appears to have been influenced by H.G. Wells&apos; novel  The Island of Dr. Moreau. Compare the following quotes:  &quot;With each experiment I improve upon the last. I get nearer and nearer. Mr. Parker, do you know what it means to feel like God?&quot;     Dr. Moreau in The Island of Lost Souls (Timecode: 33:20.)    http://youtu.be/_v1fMrQgrdk     The Bible tells us that God created his universe in seven days.

            <string>This is an interesting discussion.   I could somehow understand the point that Victor was worried about the creature&apos;s future offspring may attack humans.   However since  I have always thought how pitiful the creature  was, even if Victor blames himself and feels responsible for the deaths of those around him (but he let Justine die  - yes he &quot;tried&quot; to save her but he didn&apos;t tell anyone about the creature to the last  just to avoid being labeled as a madman, that&apos;s selfish enough I think), and despite there&apos;s a question of how we define &quot;evil&quot; and whether Victor was &quot;evil&quot; or not, it is still difficult to empathize with Victor.   Such worry (that I mentioned at the top of this comment) seems just  Victor&apos;s paranoia; considering how badly the creature needed the bride and how his sorrowful experiences had lead him think like that,  Victor, as  a creator to take responsibility over his creation, should have satisfied the creature&apos;s modest wish.;</string>

            <string>The problem summary:Hello, don`t know if that`s my problem or something`s wrong with the platform, but every single time I submit my essay (copying it from my Word file amd pasting it here) it comes in one big part, without rubricating, so it`s difficult for the people to read and evaluate my essays and makes me look stupid and look like I don`t care about form of my texts. Help needed, please!Steps to reproduce:Screenshot:;Oh, rubricating, wrong word from my dictionary, I guess)) After I paste my text from Word document I always check the division of it to parts, to paragraphs, but when I get my essays reviewed I see it`s in one part, all of it, and people have it this way too, so they say it`s not right for reviewing.  Different software, you mean, not Word? I`ve though about just writing texts right in the field for submitting but it is so less confortable...;Thank you for the help, will try it today))  ;Thanks for all of your suggestions, tried to put a blank line between the paragraphs, in the Preview looks all right, so, now have to wait and see what my evaluators will say.Thank you all again));Well, let me explain myself, I am not a native English speaker, so reading extense works in English would take way too much time and too much work for me, so if it`s a big one I read it translated to my own language. However, in the moment of submitting the essay, or better, in the moment of my essays being evaluated by other students, I always read &quot;quotations needed, more details from the book needed&quot;. Is it me who is wrong in wanting/expecting some understanding from the native speakers, or it`s them who could try and show some understanding about the situation of those who read the books for the course in their languages? Tell me your opinions, am I wrong?;</string>
            <string>These can be mild spoilers if anyone would want to read the book afterwards.The most fun thing about the book for me is that Ender being invincible. I mean he never loses. He develops his skills incredibly fast, becomes a perfect commander in no time and he is 9 or something at the end. This seems unrealistic maybe, but the book was fun to read and impressive for a couple of days. It is enough for that matter. I recommend it. The film may look better if you read the book first.;</string>
            <string>But maybe there is another Aminadab that Hawthorne related to :) (but I dont know why did Hawthorne remove the double MM to just single M)May be this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amminadabhttp://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/amminadab/I think one of Hawthorne uniqueness was his use of name from real world figure/characters to the name of his novel characters name, I also noticed this in Rappacini&apos;s Daughter and Dr. Heidegger Experiment. Maybe anyone notice in the other novel???;It nice to see that Nathaniel Hawthorne   s Dr. Heidegger   s Experiment are already make in film, because we can compare our imagination and interpretation when read the novel, and the director of the film imagination and interpretation about the novel. Also we can know if our imagination about the characters profile are have some simmilarity or difference with the film :)film link:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/138928/Dr;</string>
            <string>Ok thanks alot;From my experience, there is still 1 hour space time between time when submision or evaluation closed/deadline time to another time when the evaluation or result time opened. In this 1 hour time, when you already submited your submision or evaluation (the colour below turn to green and have cheklisted - if you still dont submit it still blue and will turn red when the deadline passed - turn to grey if beyond 1 hour and after this you cannot do anything more), you are still able to edit and resubmit submision or evaluation, until 1 hour time passed away. But beyond this 1 hour you cannot...So maybe it doesn&apos;t matter if you re-submitted in 10 or 20 or 58 minute after the deadline, if you already submited an submission/evaluation(I&apos;m sorry for my english :) ^^V );Because this is a course about literature and have grammar and structure in writting as one of grading point, beside the evaluation and critique from peer evaluation, maybe it will be valuable if some student in the course that also a Native speaker and fluent in English share some of their knowledge and experience in English to improve the english of some student that have english not as their native/first leanguage (like me).Hopefully we can improve our writting in english together, especially for the next assignment.(because I always have 1 point in grammar, for first maybe anyone can give some grade between 1-3 to my writing above, to know my false :)Feel free to  volunter and give your lesson/tips/sugestion in English writing to other student :);Thank for your response. I hope in next essay evaluation in the respond colums above the grammar point, the evaluator/student make corection like what you did now. So I dont need to guest and think myself where my grammar and structure error are (because I dont know either :), and know where is the evaluator grade point based on. Also I can learn more from the evaluation and can improve my English writing skill for the next essay.Also if the evaluator comment in the grammar colums like what you did, it will make the evaluator more responsible about their task and for their given grade point.(Just thinking, that If you evaluate my essay before I submited that, I would be have 3 point in grammar :) (just kidding :)) ;Thk. can I know what the formal form? ;Thk for your suggestions. Cannot wait for your next suggestion or another native speaker suggestion;         Some of student of this course in their peer assessment likely have some disagreement to their peer evaluation in the comment and grading point. I think one of the solution maybe we can make some &quot;Alternative and Comparative Peer Evaluation&quot; in this discusion forum.  Here how it work:         If some student feel or think that their essay is somewhat unfairly graded by another peer, then s/he posted their essay in this forum to be alternatively evaluated and graded by another and un-anonymous student, with same amount peer (5) or more; and somewhat have identical system like in peer assesment: grading point between 1-3 in the grammar and content area and the peer must give some comment about their evaluation. After the process the student can compare the grade and comment between the true course evaluation and this alternative evaluation.            The &quot;Alternative and Comparative Peer Evaluation&quot; real benefit is that the student can communicate with their evaluator about their disagreement and will give some insight and some &apos;answer&apos; why their essay graded (like that) by their peer in the (real) peer assessment (if the grade remain the same point and similar comment).            So this   &quot;Alternative and Comparative Peer Evaluation&quot; is not only for student that dont agree with their peer evaluation but also help the student get more insight about their essay. And also help student to become more better evaluator in their given grade point and comment.;Generaly I agree with the grade and comment my peer gave (especialy in grammar :), but I need another view point from another student about my essays to give me more insight about my work, that will improve my next essay.Here is my essays:               In  Hawthorne&apos;s &quot;The Birthmark,&quot; &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter,&quot; &quot;The Artist of  the Beautiful&quot; (1), and   &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment&quot; (2) I&apos;ve found  Hawthorne&apos;s fantasy about Idealism and perfectionist, for example  beauty, un(birth)marked, innocence, youth, etc that result in some fatal  end when confront more powerfull nature. Like Hawthorne&apos;s said in The  Birthmark, &quot;Thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its  invariable triumph over the immortal essence&quot; (1). There is Aylmer (1)  that  egocentrically think Georgiana birthmark is rather a boundary for  she to became perfect (beautiful) women and try remove the birtmark,  including that make Georgiana died (because the birthmark is unseparated  condition of Georgiana&apos;s nature). In &quot;Rappaccini&apos;s Daughter,&quot; (1) there  is Giovanni who cannot understand and accept Beatrice condition, and  make she drink the antidote that result in her death (because the  Beatrice poison is part of her life).                  There is Owen that compensate his unresolved love and the  (perfect) beauty of Annie to the mechanical butterfly, like Owen said     it has absorbed my own being into itself;...is represented ... the soul  of an Artist of the Beautiful!   (1). In &quot;Dr. Heidegger&apos;s Experiment  (2),&quot; we can see Heidegger&apos;s friends Medbourne, Killigrew, Gascoigne and  Widow Wycherly that still seek the perfect time of their youth when  changed by the water (their behavior dont change due experience of being  old before).                In Poe &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Man of  the Crowd,&quot; and &quot;Mesmeric Revelation&quot; (3) I&apos;ve found Poe Fantasy about  strugle and way to understand other or ourself with some different way  like hipnotize, observation, etc.                  I think the moral in some Hawthorne and Poe novel is to make  unconditonal acceptance to other and learn from our own mistake  (imperfect state) to make introspection about who we are, especially  when we see and think about other and problems. Like Mr. Rabkin says  that the word &quot;know&quot; is contain some difference meaning (4), so we  cannot just use our &quot;know&quot; only without know what others &quot;know,&quot; its  like use empathy when see other people or problems.

            <string>What can I do, if anthing, about this - it&apos;s obviously an essay but looks as though it is for a different course! ;Well it doesn&apos;t really seem to be about Poe and Hawthorne, though it does mention a story by Poe briefly but not one of the ones we were told to do - it is well written so I have no problem giving it a 2 for that , but can&apos;t work out how to judge it for content.;Thank you, I am just double checking that the story mentioned isn&apos;t one that I should have read, it is a good essay though!;</string>
            <string>I agree ... Squares are not allowed because you have to use the number 2.   Square roots use only the symbol, so they are not excluded (although they are excluded in some versions of the puzzle).0s are not allowed either.   While .4 seems like a bit of a stretch, the zero is used for convention and clarity rather than necessity.   So while your calculator might not let you do it, it is acceptable.  ;I think that they needed to continue to eat from the Tree of Life.   I don&apos;t think one piece of fruit from the tree of life was enough to make them immortal.   While they lived in Eden, they had access to the Tree of Life and could continue to eat from it.   When they were banished, they lost access.;I suspect someone might have picked up on &apos;focussed&apos; as a misspelled word.   It&apos;s the British version - in the US, it&apos;s spelled &apos;focused&apos;.;</string>

            <string>It&apos;s been mentioned a few times that after the Fall God rewarded Adam and Eve with mortality. It is true that after the Fall Adam and Eve were mortal. But that does not mean that the Fall caused mortality. After Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Good and Evil God decides to evict them from Eden LEST they eat of the Tree of Life and become immortal. Adam and Eve were created mortal, and remained mortal after the Fall. What needs to be explained (and I&apos;ve never encountered a Church Father or Scholastic who has entertained this idea) is why Adam and Eve did not eat of the Tree of Life first. We are mortal not because they ate of one tree but because they neglected to eat of the other.;</string>

            <string>Hello - this is the first time I publish my essay. The reason I do it is to find out how bad my English actually is. So, please - be honest, I really want to know, and I will take no offense. Of course, any other ideas, comments or whatever are welcome. Thank you.Throughout  the centuries, many authors wrote about humans striving for perfection  at all costs. In the ancient Greece, the Myth of Icarus tells about a  man who flew to close to the Sun, thus destroying his own wings and  falling to death. That this motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, we can  conclude from looking into stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who  represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese &quot;version of Icarus&quot;,  respectively. The stories of &quot;why claiming the Sun&quot; are different for  these characters, but the actual cause is the same for all of them  (striving for perfection), just as is the final outcome (death). The  same idea appears in the Book of Genesis - Eve is tricked in eating from  the tree that will make her and Adam omnipotent, like God, but they are  punished by being excluded from Heaven. When comparing our world, the &quot;modern&quot; world, with the ancient  cultures, we claim &quot;progress and prosperity&quot;. We claim that the science  and technology advancement allowed us to create a more developed  society. A society more evolved and better in all fields, from social  relations to healthcare. In the short-story &quot;The Birthmark&quot;, N. Hawthorne writes about a  distinguished scientist, a man who astonished the whole Europe with his  mind&apos;s achievements. That man,  Aylmer, marries a woman with a birthmark  on her cheek, otherwise perfectly beautiful. Understanding this  perfection stained only by the birthmark, he uses all means available to  remove it. Eventually, he succeeds, but the wife dies. In this work, the author shows us that all these centuries, milions  of chips fabricated and bilions of engines manufactured later we still  suffer from the same weaknesses we suffered in the dawn of our time. The  human spirit is still willing to sacrifice himself and anything else  just to get a little bit closer to the perfection, for no matter how  short a time interval.FORM:peer 1     Form meets the satisfactory standard.  I found no structural errors.peer 2      The structure and grammar of the essay seems adequate. However, the  thesis presented did not have a conclusion. The third paragraph is a  description of the story and it is not needed since we all read the same  stories. I would suggest a bit more planning with the next essay. The  score for the Form is of 2.peer 4      Weird grammar fail, need for spell check, bad use of &quot;the&quot;, and  confusingly constructed sentences. You did try for some big words  though.peer 5     Cite your workCONTENT:peer 1     This is a little hard to follow jumping to so many examples.  It is hard in 320 words to develop so many thoughts adequately.peer 2      The essay presents valid arguments. As mentioned earlier, the structure  of the essay and lack of conclusion makes it seem less insightful and  persuasive. Therefore, the score for the content is of 2.peer 4     Interesting idea but too much background and not enough from the work itself.COMMENTS:peer 1      I don&apos;t agree that these stories support striving for perfection as  much as seeking power.  Maybe  Aylmer wanted a &quot;perfect&quot; wife so he felt  more powerful as the possessor of the perfect woman.peer 4      Just really hard to read. More knowledge of the English language is  necessary to write a college level essay for an informed reader of this  course.TOTAL SCORE: 4;Thank you very much for your opinion .But still, my question remains: how bad my English is?;</string>
