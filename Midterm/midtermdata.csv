I'm looking forward to learning from Professor Rabkin, as well as from our fellow course mates. Cheers.  ;Hello Theodossai,Happy to meet you here as well! Indeed, we live in interesting times for sure. Many things that once seemed like science fiction are now science. This is one of the things I love about this genre--that which can be imagined may one day be...more than imagined (i.e. real). I also like your question here...""what is real?"" A perfect theme for some of the sci-fi/fantasy that I have read. Philip K. Dick comes to mind, along with a slew of other authors.I look forward to exploring this course together.Cheers;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee."" All the readings except Ray Bradbury's  The Martian Chronicles  and Ursula K. LeGuin's  The Left Hand of Darkness  will be available online at no charge.Yep, it's the whole thing. However, I will say that it is not essential to discuss every single story...it wouldn't be a coherent reading since there may be broad themes overall, not every theme is in every story.  ;Thanks for that Grimm's clarification, William. I too had initially interpreted ""the specific stories"" to mean we would get a list of selections for this first reading assignment as part of Thursday's ""before you read"" video, but your comment makes much more sense, so I will get busy with the complete Crane translation.;I like making lists in twitter to keep in touch somewhat fast. I will create this course's one tomorrow, so start giving me your usernames so I can add you and you may follow the list to find more people from this course.I also suggest using some Hashtag over there to talk about this course, so I'd like your suggestions.:D;"
FALSE,St2,Coh1,2,1,1,1,0.0388038,0.868064211,0.75,0,0.375,0.2595717,0,"Actually, back then, a lot of women died from childbearing (many childbearings) and the fathers married again, if they could afford to  (or ""shacked up"" with another woman). Step-mothers must have been a very common occurance.;I would have an easier time deciding on a Least favorite of their tales ... and yet still, I think it'd be hard to choose.;To be honest I don't think it matters, but it makes for great discussion :)I  completely agree with your point about wonder in science (for me evolution and synthetic biology are simply  awesome); and the wherefores in religion (Leviticus - OMG :) .I think Frankenstein and SF/F is a bit like the chicken/egg question - which came first? (clearly a lizard with feathers). In other words I don't think it is really either - but is instead something part of the way between religion and science which looks like SF but  doesn't yet have all the characteristics as we know them now.;Cheri,I like 'speculative fiction'. There seems to be a strong tendency to categorize the arts, literature included. For example, think of how may genres (and sub-genres) there are in music. The same can be said for stories and books. But do all stories fit neatly into one single category? I don't think they do, but using the categories to classify books by the general themes they employ can be useful, if not too limiting.  ;I'm with you, William. It's useful to talk about what ""kind"" of story one could expect from a book, but the classic terms ""sci fi"" and ""fantasy"" are a bit square these days. Additionally, many people are so zealous in their definitions of those terms that I like to avoid them when I can. I tend to be drawn to books that are neither one or the other, but are clearly in that ""what if"" category that breaks the bounds of real life (whatever that is). ""Speculative Fiction"" (not my own invention, to be sure) indicates a step away from the real world as we know it and a step into a world that has currently unavailable elements (like magic, or dragons, or space travel).;These are the real versions, not the Disney versions. That is a significant difference IMHO. I love the Grimm's Tales, as written. I own a Lucy Crane translation (with Walter Crane illustrations) that is essentially the same book Prof. Rabkin suggests, but the pagination is different. I am up to page 161 of 313. I plan on reading several more stories tonight.  ;I don't mean to be contradictory, but...there are actually other units that cover more than one story - Unit 2 covers Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (two separate stories), Unit 5 covers several stories from Hawthorne and several from Poe, Unit 6 covers two novels and also two short stories from Wells, Unit 7 covers a novel from Burroughs and another novel from Gilman. See the Syllabus for details.  ;I second the vote for Neil Gaiman. See, for instance, American Gods. Or, perhaps, this book is more a modern form of mythology rather than a fairytale? Also consider the works of H.P, Lovecraft. Though these are considered Horror (for good reason), they might also be considered a type of mythology.  Here is a question for us to ponder...what is the difference between mythology and fairytales?  ;Cheri, I've watched several episodes of Grimm (the TV series). I like it, for the most part. Some of the characters are done well, and the story line kept my interest up through the first season. Then my interest started to fade. It became a bit predictable for me. I don't know though, I might go back to it again with fresh eyes, having just read Grimm's Household Tales for this course. :)  Kevin, ""Urban Fantasy"" seems to be the name of a genre I used to know as ""Magical Realism"". In any case, I see reference to Urban Fantasy much more than to Magical Realism these days, so maybe the former name won out. Or perhaps they are different genres altogether, but if so, they have a LOT of cross-overs. I wonder sometimes who comes up with these genre titles? Is it the authors or the marketers and publishing houses? I think that would make a difference. An author writes a great book and it starts to sell. Marketers say, ""Oh look, potential for a new market, we can make lots of money, let's call it X and package it for the masses"". Or something like that. :/ Writing and the book business are two completely different animals. Of course, I want authors to make money, so they can continue to write excellent books for me to read and enjoy, but I've heard some horror stories (pun intended) about the book business. It seems authors get shafted a lot of the time, unless they make the best seller's list.Faith, I'm a huge Doctor Who fan! I started watching the series back when Tom Baker (the Fourth Doctor) was the current Doctor. I was excited when BBC began a new round in 2005 with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston).  ;Gaiman dedicates American Gods to Karen Acker and Roger Zelazny. For those familiar with Zelazny, you will see the connection here (direct use of characters and subjects from mythology in a novel way, in a contemporary/modern/postmodern setting).  Karen, thanks for pointing out Charles de Lint. I've heard the name, but have actually never read anything by him. I will check him out. Any particular recommendations as a first book to read by him?;Thanks for the recommendations Karen. I am scanning a list of titles to pick my first de Lint book. I am having a ""Why haven't I ever read Charles de Lint?"" moment. LOL.  ;Thanks for sharing this David. I am going to read the essay by Tolkien. A quick glance...it looks wonderful. I would expect no less from such a master of the art.  ;Greetings course mates,See this article on The Guardian about a recent (circa 2010 - 2012) discovery of over 500 fairy tales, all collected around the same time the Grimm brothers were collecting tales.  A quote from the article:Von Sch  nwerth spent decades asking country folk, labourers and servants about local habits, traditions, customs and history, and putting down on paper what had only been passed on by word of mouth. In 1885, Jacob Grimm said this about him: ""Nowhere in the whole of Germany is anyone collecting [folklore] so accurately, thoroughly and with such a sensitive ear.""Also, here is a second article about the discovery, this one published in  The New Yorker.I thought this might be of interest to some here, especially considering our current reading for Unit 1.  ;Excellent response Megan! Your understanding of the instructional clips from Prof. Rabkin matches mine exactly.  Emily, just keep in mind this is a humanities course, not a science course. The type and form of writing between the two disciplines are vastly different.  ;P.S., Emily, in addition to the videos and what others have already said, perhaps this article on Purdue OWL might be helpful as well.  ;Haha, I feel the same way, we need an ""I'm a writer doing research for a novel"" tag on our searches. In lieu of that, there is always TOR (says the man, posting under his name).;Hi Gretchen,You ask why in the tale, ""The Death of the Hen"" does everyone die. My reading of this tale is that everyone dies because, well...everyone dies. What I mean is, all people (in real life) eventually die. And we don't have a choice about that. This tale made me think of situations like having a family member or loved one that is terminally ill, take cancer for example. I may want more than anything in the world to help my family member. Like the Cock, I may try my hardest to find a way to restore my loved one to health, but in the end, it may come to naught. It is a harsh reality being presented here. Sometimes you can try to help, but it doesn't always work. Your ""Hen"" may die, regardless of your good intentions. And eventually, you will too. And so will everyone else you know. Lessons in facing and accepting our own mortality.  Sorry to be so pessimistic. I think it is appropriate in the context of this tale though.  ;You might be on to something Sean. I'm sure the The Thirty Years War had a huge impact on some of these tales. Although, the Grimm Brothers weren't writing them down until the early 19th century, it is said many of the tales came from the 17th century (as you've pointed out, the time of the Thirty Years War). About a hundred years before this (1500's), was the Protestant Reformation. I noticed a few explicit references to Christianity in some of the tales, and not so much in others. But I was wondering the same thing. I think there are threads in these that could certainly be teased out - the old ways (paganism) vs. Christianity. Also, Catholicism vs. Protestantism. Not just in this tale, but in several others as well.  ;This is a great point Khriss. Peer reviews should focus on the task at hand, does this essay ""enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course""? I know as I do my peer reviews, this is the question I will have in mind, not whether I happen to agree with the views of my course mate writing the essay, but rather, if he or she has written a piece that enriches the reading of fellow students in some way.   ;Yes, excellent point Sean. I feel ya. Personally speaking, I love my own ideas to be challenged, to be pushed beyond my limits and boundaries, to experience views from a completely different perspective then what I normally hold. This is one of the reasons I love the humanities so much. This is one of the reasons I enrolled in this course. From some time spent browsing around the forum, it seems I will not be disappointed! I can't wait to read other course mates essays, and start writing my own. Cheers.  ;I've submitted my essay as well, and am looking forward to seeing peer reviews of my work. I agree it was difficult to restrict the writing to the specified word count, but this did force me to try to be as concise as possible. I have been keeping a ""Reader's Journal"" which has been helpful. As I read the texts, I will keep notes and also do some free writing, to reflect on what impressed me from the readings, etc. My notes from the Grimm's Tales are about 5 pages long (in an Open Office document). When it came time to draft the essay, I went back to my Reader's Journal and found several themes that I could have explored. I chose one, crafted a thesis statement and then wrote the essay. I think my first essay we OK, but I'm hoping to improve as we go along. Cheers, and best wishes on your assignments. I look forward to reading the essays I get for peer review tomorrow.  ;I propose that one of the themes from the Grimm tales that is still alive and well today is the use of trickery and/or deceit to gain advantage over another, or to get out of a pending conflict. You see this again and again in these tales, held up almost as if it were a virtue. Often a conflict is set up and then resolved via trickery. Think of Clever Grethel (""...why has he gone and run away with my pair of fowls that I had just dished up.""), that she had, in fact, just feasted on. Think of The Bremen Town Musicians, where the animals tricked the robbers into thinking they were some kind of goblin so they could stay in the house and eat the food. Think of The Gallant Tailor  with his ""seven at one blow"". Perhaps there is a fine line between deceit and cleverness? In any case, I think this theme of outwitting another, gaining an advantage, being quick on your feet (so to speak) is just as popular today as it was when the Grimm brothers were writing.  ;Justin, you can think of different patterns you see repeating in the tales. For instance, step-mothers, princesses, kings, talking animals, ventures into the dark forest, trickery and deceit, marriage, gold, etc. Identify a theme or pattern that interests you and then re-read a few of the tales to see how this theme/pattern is employed. Think about what it might represent on a symbolic level, not just a literal level. This might help in generating ideas for your essay. Best of luck.  ;In this podcast, Dr. Allan Hunter, author of Princes, Frogs and Ugly Sisters: The Healing Power of the Grimm Brother's Tales interprets many of the tales in terms of therapeutic psychological archetypes and motifs. An interesting perspective.  ;Hey Mark,Along with all of the awesome suggestions other course mates have made, maybe it will help to also review your notes, pick one idea that really stands out, and then craft a thesis statement from that. Once you have your thesis statement, then essentially all you need to do is support it in the body of your essay. (see link for help on thesis statements).  ;For future reference, here is the link for the course calendar. It shows the dates and times for each assignment. The times given are in EST, so you will have to convert to your local time. You may also want to print out and/or just read over, the work expectations page. It has a lot of solid information in there. Just one example, it answers your question regarding if you have to complete all essays to get a Statement of Accomplishment in this class (you do not, but read the details for more info)As an aside, I want to say it is heartening to see so many course mates jump on this thread to offer suggestions, feedback and encouragement to Mark, and to each other. Bravo!  ;Understood Mark, and an easy mistake to make. In fact, I did something similar in my very first MOOC. The bright side is, in a MOOC, the student base is truly international, so while we might on occasion struggle with properly calculating time zones, etc., we have the great benefit of interacting with people from all over the world, any time of the day or night. I love this aspect! No matter what type of hours you keep, if you log into the forum, there are bound to be other course mates logged in at that time as well (no matter what time it is locally to you). I happen to keep late hours, but this does not preclude me from having near live interaction in the forum.  Sorry to hear you missed the first deadline. It sounds like you have that figured out now. Cheers;While it might be considered a controversial idea to think of one of the world's greatest authors in this light, you are not alone in speculating about this Javier. For just one example, see this article in the Guardian.  ;Here is a thought experiment to consider. Let's say today, some unknown author, someone you never heard of, a single white male in his 30's, spent a great deal of his time hanging around 7 to 10 year old girls, taking photos of them half naked, writing them letters saying things like ""Extra thanks and kisses for the lock of hair. I have kissed it several times - for want of having you to kiss, you know, even hair is better than nothing."" (a real quote from Lewis Carroll to a 10 year old ""child friend"" of his), telling one of his adult friends that ""I confess I do not admire naked boys in pictures. They always seem... to need clothes, whereas one hardly sees why the lovely forms of girls should ever be covered up."", laying awake at night, unable to go to sleep after having spent the day with his favorite ""child friend"", and throwing himself into the study of mathematics in the hope of ridding himself from ""unholy thoughts, which torture with their hateful presence, the fancy that would fain be pure"".I bet if these things were revealed about some unknown author today, we would see a trial, or a mob at his house or something similar.  Carroll's own sister even questioned him in a letter in 1893, to which he replied ""I do like getting such letters as yours. I think all you say about my girl-guests is most kind and sisterly ... But I don't think it at all advisable to any controversy about it."", further adding that he does not care for the opinion of others, and is only concerned with his own conscience.I'm just saying, there seems to be something more here than just being friendly with girls in the way an uncle or grandfather might be. I don't claim Carroll ever acted on it, but it is hard for me to just dismiss the issue as an unfounded claim, regardless of how much I love his writing.   This is such a taboo topic today that it is difficult for many to really analyse it objectively. Folks tend to either dismiss it as ridiculous slander or make accusations without any facts. The emotional response is the typical response, one way or another. I feel the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. I think Carroll had desires for young girls, found this problematic, and didn't act on it in any kind of physical way, but that doesn't mean he was completely innocent in his thoughts.  What does this have to do with our assignments or this class? I would say, since we are to do a ""close reading"" of the text, this might be something to keep in mind, the same way that knowing the history of what was happening in Germany when the Grimm Brother's were collecting their tales might be relevant to understanding the text, regardless of your position on the issue.  ;Hi all,So I was searching around on some of the site resources and found this really awesome podcast of Prof. Rabkin on the SFF podcast show. Very insightful. Click on the link and when you get to the page, scroll down until you see the play button (alternatively there is an audio mp3 link, where you can download the podcast directly).;I'm a Dali fan.

My best advice is to keep a notebook (or word file) handy as you read, and to simply jot down themes that really speak to you in the text. You may have a long list, or a short list. It doesn't really matter. Just note down items of interest. Then, when you are done reading, you can go back to your notes and choose one theme, and start brainstorming for your essay. Something to keep in mind that might help...none of us in this course are going to write an essay that covers the entire novel. All of us are, in one way or another, going to pick out something that we like, or dislike about the text, or something that provoked further thought about the text, and write about that. The beauty is, there will be a great diversity of views. This is to be encouraged. Cheers.;First, I really respect my fellow course mates who are not native English speakers taking this course. I can imagine how difficult that might be. When I review an essay and it appears to me that the writer does not have English as his or her first language, I do take that into consideration, and I try to be as helpful as possible. That said, when I look at the rubric for the essays, the section on Form says,""Please indicate in 30-150 words your judgment of the FORM of the essay you have just read.   FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure. Are the sentences grammatically correct?   Are the words properly used?   Is the exposition and argument laid out clearly?   An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.""If grammar, usage and structure are poorly done, if the exposition and/or argument is not clear, etc. the grade will reflect that for this section. I will, of course, comment on both strengths and weaknesses. I will also offer examples as suggestions for improvement.  If I was to, say, take one of the courses that are conducted in Spanish, I would expect my grades to reflect how well I write in Spanish rather than my native tongue. I would want to know where I made mistakes and where I was correct, so that my Spanish could improve. I wouldn't want my course mates to hide my mistakes out of a concern for hurting my feelings. I am here to learn, not to get a certain grade (if that makes sense).There is, however, a level of sensitivity that should be expected. Constructive criticism should be the goal in my humble opinion.  ;Yes, I was definitely hooked. Of course, coming from my culture, the story and characters are all very familiar to me ( I live in the US). Where was I hooked? I was hooked when Alice decided to go down the rabbit hole. I'm a sucker for a good adventure. I wanted to follow her along as well. What's down there? Let's go see! :) After the initial hook, my interest was sustained by the dialog. I love the paradox and contradictions. Especially how meanings that are often just taken for granted are questioned and deconstructed in some of the dialog. I've heard lots of people refer to the dialog as ""nonsense"". I have to disagree, it is not nonsensical at all (except possbily in a few places). For instance, think of the dialog between Alice and the Caterpillar (in Chapter 5). The question ""Who are you?"" is, in fact, very profound. It may seem like nonsense to some, but I would say, go a little deeper than the surface level and you will see there is a wealth of meaning here. Have you ever stopped and asked yourself who you are? If you haven't, you should try it sometime, and see where it leads.  Cheers!;You are quite welcome Anahita! I am grateful for the forum where we can all discuss our thoughts about these works. I'm more than happy to join in on the conversation. Thank you for starting the thread. :);The power of an image is strong. The actual text being referred to is from Chapter 5 of Through the Looking-Glass. Here is the quote:""So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep, to get hold of the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off     and for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water     while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.""No mention of ""golden"" hair, just tangled hair. It must have been Sir John Tenniel who made Alice a blonde? Unless there is another reference somewhere that I have missed?  UPDATE: Then again, Tenniel's illustrations are in black and white, though on the cover of my book, one of them is colored in, and shows Alice as a blonde. Not sure if the originals were colored at all? The rest in the actual text of the book are black and white.  The ""real"" Alice (Alice Liddell, who Carroll based the character on) was a brunette.  ;No worries Joanna. :) I think it makes a valid point though, the influence of illustrations and later, film adaptations, leave strong imprints on us (myself included). I always think of Alice as a blonde.  I would like to find out when Tenniel's illustrations were colored, and if he did that himself, or if it was somebody else. Also, if the colored illustrations precede the films. Google-fu activate! lol.  ;This is an excellent point Daniel. The author really employs his craft to get the reader to experience a lot of the same confusion and frustration Alice feels in the story, no?  ;Frazer is an excellent source. I would also add Joseph Campbell's  Masks of God series, and several books by Mircea Eliade.  ;Hello Greg,I am not (yet) a published author, but I am working in that direction. This year I promised myself to focus more on my writing. When I discovered Coursera, I immediately signed up for as many humanities courses as I could find. This course was on the top of the list. So, here I am. :)So far I've found that there is a great wealth of knowledge and inspiration in the texts we are reading. Like you, I intend on getting as much out of this course as I can, really digging in to the stories, and then drawing from them in various way in my own writing. The essay writing, peer reviews (both giving and receiving them), and the forum are all excellent tools to provoke a deeper exploration of the texts. I'm here. I'm on board. Thanks for starting this thread.    ;At present I am in the planning stages of a novel. In terms of genre, I guess ""speculative fiction"" is probably the closest label I would be comfortable with. Some of my biggest influences are Robert Anton Wilson, Philip K. Dick, and (an older one) Hermann Hesse (though there are tons more).;Rumpelstiltskin is one of my favorite Grimm's Tales. I can envision a re-telling of the story with a somewhat ""occult"" or ""supernatural"" flavor to it. It has many of the elements already (i.e. promising your first born child, a strange ""little man"" that acts as a trickster character, the magic of having to learn his name, since there is an old occult principle that if you know the name of a demon, you can wield power over it, etc.)  ;Hello Elena,This is interesting. You wrote:""The problem is WHY we are still repeating this patterns.And, yes the answer: it is all about ancient rituals.""I have never read Propp. My first introduction to him was from the clip where Prof. Rabkin mentions him. I do find his theories interesting enough for me to look further into his work. You mentioned that you have studied his work. Is what you write above about the stories being based on ancient rituals Propp's contention, or your own? Pardon my ignorance of Propp's theories beyond just a very basic overview at this point. :)  ;You're on to something here Elena. Bluebeard is totally a serial killer! Society just didn't use that term back then.  ;Greetings course mates,If you have read the stories and are looking to delve in a bit deeper, you might consider watching these two film adaptations of  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (see links below).Alice - Director Jan Svankmajer (1988).  A very  avant garde,    surrealistic  interpretation of the story.Alice in Wonderland - Director Jonathan Miller (1966).  An interesting take on the story, produced as a TV play (for BBC). The characters are all dressed in standard Victorian style clothing (including the creatures, like the White Rabbit, Mock Turtle, etc.).  ;Thank you for the comments Ishan. My personal preference is the actual book. That said, after reading the book, I do tend to seek out various interpretations/adaptations on film just to see the stories in another medium. I rather like Svankmajer's version, though I realize for many it may come across as a bit too surreal. The same director also did an adaptation of the Faust tale, which is equally obscure, though I rather enjoyed it after having read Goethe's Faust and Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus. Believe it or not, I have yet to see Burton's Alice in Wonderland. I plan on checking it out, eventually. And re-reading Carroll's stories again later. I tend to return to certain books again and again.  ;Director Jan Svankmajer's 1988 film Alice (Czech title,  N  co z Alenky),incorporates live-action, puppetry, and stop-motion/claymation. That doesn't mean you can't do a version as well (you should do it!). Besides, Svankmajer's film is not 100% claymation by any means. It is really a very surreal film, worth a look IMHO. Not for everyone though, quite avant garde.  ;You're welcome Amelia. I encourage you to explore your idea. I think Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking-Glass would make an excellent claymation film. Cheers.;I really think you have hit on to something insightful here John--the idea that the ""paranormal"" or ""occult"" is often overlooked or dismissed due to cultural conditioning or a prevailing rationalist world-view. If you think of the time period when this book was written (the late 19th century) and the place (Europe) you will see that this was a theme being explored in great detail. There was a definite shift from the ""old ways"" (i.e. folk-traditions, religion, etc.) towards a scientific/empirical approach during the previous Age of Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries). During the late 18th century there was a reaction against this in some of the literature and arts, often termed the Romantic period (a few examples are Lord Byron, Percy and Mary Shelly, John William Polidori, et al). Dracula seems to be informed by the Romantic period to an extent. Also, in Europe at the time Stoker was writing (i.e. the late 19th century) there was an ""occult revival"" taking place that carried into the beginning of the next century. See, for example, the formation of the Theosophical Society in 1875 and the formation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1887. These themes were prevalent in society, even outside of the realm of literature.  ;"

I make notations and comments on the print out for my own self reference, and then after reading and making these comments on all the hard-copies I will type up my comments and grades for each section for each essay into a file in my word processor. Finally I will copy and paste the comments and grades into the site for each essay. For me, comments really matter. I know when I receive constructive comments and suggestions it helps me greatly, so I try to do the same for each essay I review.I was amazed this time around. I got really great marks. I actually thought my essay for the last unit was better and was concerned about this unit. However, last unit I got a 4 (which I was happy with) and this unit I got a 6 (which took me by surprise). The comments help me know what folks liked about the essay, and also some areas that could be improved upon. Thanks to all who reviewed my work (whoever you are).  P.S. perhaps a little wine AFTER the reviews is called for though. :P;Anon, I love your thesis, and you supported your argument in a very clear and logical manner. Your essay most certainly enriches my reading of the text. Great work.  ;I was surprised that I received a 6, but very thankful for it. I also want to thank my fellow-students for peer reviewing my work, and offering such helpful and thoughtful comments. Here is my essay for Unit 2 that scored a ""6"".Questions of Identity      Who are  you?    said the Caterpillar (p. 46), succinctly encapsulating one of the recurring themes of    Alice's  Adventures in Wonderland. This story is replete with questions of identity.    I hardly know, sir...    replies Alice, thereby confirming her confusion about who she is.    Who are you?    seems like such a simple question, and yet, upon further reflection, it is quite profound. Again and again this question of identity arises in the story in various forms.   In Chapter 1 (Adventures)  the narrator tells us,    ...this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.    indicating that Alice already had a predilection towards a fluid self-image, even prior to entering Wonderland. After giving herself advice (i.e. talking to herself as if she were another person), Alice subsequently argues against her imaginary self, commenting that    there's hardly enough of me left to make  one  respectable person!    In Chapter 2 (Adventures), Alice muses,    Who in the world am I?   , replying with    Ah, that's the great puzzle!    as she then  proceeds to consider in a long dialog (again with herself) if she is perhaps Ada, or Mable. This is the great puzzle for Alice, yet I also feel Lewis Carroll is telling us this is the great puzzle for us as well. Under the guise of an innocent child's story, the author is asking some probing philosophical questions. As we follow the adventures of Alice in Wonderland, we are also following a personal quest of our own. Carroll is asking us not to take our own lives for granted. He is telling us things are not always as they appear to be. He is challenging us to step back for a moment and ask ourselves who we really are. Deep down, who are you? Do you  really  know?  [304 words];Thank you for the kind comments Anon. At first I was going to show examples from both Adventures and Through the Looking-Glass. Though once I started writing, it became evident that I wouldn't be able to keep it within the required word count, so I stuck with just the first story where this theme is most prominent (according to my own reading of it). That said, I think it would be interesting to explore the same theme in Through the Looking-Glass as well.  I have a blog on wordpress. I think once this course is over I am going to go back to each of my essays and revise them, perhaps expand them as well, and post them to the blog as a series. I will, of course, give credit back to this class. :) Perhaps other students might want their essay's posted on the blog as well? I will start a thread when it is closer to the end of the course to see if there is interest. It might be a fun project to do when this awesome class is done and gone. I have found the peer review process (both giving and receiving) in this course (and others I have taken) helps with my own writing, especially when it comes to revising a draft.  Cheers!;To Anna, Jae, Pallavi and Katy,Thank you all so much for the kind words. Apologies for the long delay in responding. I have been out of town since Friday the 21st. I went to visit New Orleans (in Louisiana, USA) and didn't get back until recently. Unfortunately this means I missed the essay deadline for Dracula. I am upset about that, but will press on with Frankenstein. I have read Dracula in the past, but have been re-reading it for this course. However, the holiday put me behind. I am going to start reading Frankenstein now and taking notes for ideas about my essay for that. I will probably also re-visit Dracula when the course is over and write an essay about it for my own purposes.The word count limit has been serving as an exercise in writing concisely, attempting to pull concepts together in a few words, something I struggle with at times.  Thanks again to all who commented for the very encouraging words about my essay. I wish everyone the best with your own work.  ;Mary, that sounds wonderful. I love how you incorporated the Descent of Ishtar motif into your story. One of my personal hobbies, you might say, is the study of comparative mythology and religion. There are a vast amount of narratives from different times and cultures floating around in my head. As an aspiring novelist, I feel that I will be incorporating some of these in one form or another into my stories. You have given me encouragement to pursue this. Thank you for that. :);Hello Teish,It's great to hear what you are doing. I think this is wonderful. I'll take a look at your website. Best wishes in your writing endeavors and in this course.  ;Thinking this out leads me to wonder if part of the subtext of Dracula is a question of what is reality. Is Stoker implying that what we consider reality is probably just one aspect of that reality but that there are more levels and layers of reality?I think this is very insightful DaveN. Thanks for sharing.  ;Great advice Megan!;"

This is one of the things I love about the humanities in general. There is no one correct interpretation (including, I would argue, the interpretation of the author). Like any form of art (and a good novel is a form of art, so is dance, music, painting, sculpture, etc.), there is more to it then initially meets the eye.  Where would the world be if everything was simply black or white, true or false, correct or incorrect? What about imagination and creativity? If a text can provoke thought, debate and engaging dialog, in addition to entertainment, that is saying something IMHO.  As any creative artist knows, your art is never truly just ""your"" art. Rather, it is like a child you birth, it has a life of it's own, and the way others interact with it is part of the artistic process.  ;So far I've had fairly decent success with the peer review process. Some reviews are certainly more helpful than others, but that is just how it goes. That said, even the ""bad"" reviews have been helpful to me in the sense that I am receiving some kind of feedback from someone other than myself about my writing. If you ever publish your writing, for example, you are sending it out in the world for anyone to read, critique, and interpret however they want. Some of the public will have insightful views of your work, some of the public will not. The peer review process in this course might be thought of as a sample of that type of reaction. If someone completely misunderstands what you are trying to say, that says something in itself. How could I have written this better so more people can easily understand what I am trying to communicate? If someone simply just doesn't take the time, and that is obvious, that is a different story. However, no sweat off my brow, I move on to the next review and look for the gems.  In addition to all of the above, I can say that by doing peer-reviews myself in a careful and thoughtful manner, not only am I offering some solid feedback to my peers, but I am also improving my own writing. Doing reviews improves your own writing process as it sharpens and hones your skills. It's a win/win situation for me.  ;I'll come out of the silence to say I love Frankenstein as well. And not only the story, but even how it was written. I happen to read a lot of literature from several different periods, including the 19th century, so the prose was not uncommon for me. Perhaps that helped.  For this course, I read Frankenstein in two days. I would have read it all the way through in one, but I was visiting with a friend when I started it and thought it would be rude of me to ignore her to read 166 pages while I was supposed to be hanging out. :) So I basically read about 20 pages that night. Then the following night, while at home by myself, I read the rest of the way through.  There are so many themes going on in this book. It kept me engaged. I love the romantic period in general, the disrupting of a traditional worldview, the questions of where science might lead us (including how it can be very problematic), references to the alchemists (Agrippa, Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus), the whole back-story of how this story came about even.  No, it's not sword and sorcery, nor is it space opera, but...so what? Those genres have merit in their own way, but this book has stood the test of time. At 195 years and still going, that can't be denied.  ;I agree Alejandro. I feel that the ambiguity of the characters (especially Victor and the creature) is one of the elements that makes this story so interesting. There are no clear ""good guys and bad guys"" (heroes and villains).  There are things about Victor I really like--his desire for knowledge, his devotion to his work, his love for his family (though he fails in this). There are things about Victor I despise--his pettiness, his selfishness, his immediate abandonment of the creatue, his self-loathing, etc.  The same for the creature, there are things I really like about the creature--his struggle for humanity, his inventiveness in how he learns to read and write, his sentiments for the De Lacey family, etc. Of course, the murders the creature does are not excusable, but as you say, it is complex, we can understand perhaps why he did them even if we don't agree with them (the abandonment, the loneliness, the treatment every human ever gave him that he encountered, etc).  Life itself is typically a lot like this, really messy, no clear right and wrong, multiple facets have to be considered, etc. At 18, Mary Shelley already experienced a lot more of life--including liberating freedoms as well as devastating tragedies--than what an 18 year old of our (post) modern era might typically experience. This comes through in the novel for me.  ;Sex and power video? Sounds like I'm missing something interesting. lol.  ;In addition to Prof. Rabkin's excellent videos for this unit, here is a very insightful interpretation of Frankenstein by Prof. Anne K. Mellor, called Mothering Monsters.  The gist of her interpretation is that Shelley was exploring what it would be like for a man to birth a child. The obvious answer (based on Mellor's take of this story) is that it would be disastrous, a monstrosity. There is more to it then this, but you should listen to the presentation to hear it for yourself.  ;"

Not only has it allowed me to practice my own writing (via the essays), but it has also allowed me to consider many different views about the texts, both from my own readings, but also from our fellow course mates (by peer reviewing essays as well as browsing around the forums). And of course, the ""cherry on top"" of all of this is the insight our Professor shares from his videos.  Without all of these components, this would simply be a course to encourage people to read and leave it at that. The analysis part is what makes it so much more.  ;Thanks for your comments Mary. I agree with you completely. Looking ahead towards submitting chapter summaries and so forth to publishers, I feel the essays in this course--with the limited word count--are really forcing me to write more succinctly. It is a wonderful exercise!  The peer review process (on the receiving end) is softening me up for critique, feedback, and even the inevitable rejection slips that any author has to endure until one day, miracle of miracles, they actually get PUBLISHED. :)  Thanks again for the feedback, and the advice.  ;Excellent Georgy! I'm happy to hear you are staying enrolled. I agree, part of the benefit of this course (arguably, the most important benefit) is the knowledge we attain through the readings, discussions, videos and peer reviews. The certificate is secondary to all of this (though it would be nice to have as well, when all is said and done).  ;I agree with your comments here Joanna. I totally see why we have started with Grimm's Tales, Alice, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. These stories are essential to what came after them in the genres of Fantasy and Science Fiction. This may not be evident at first glance, but with close readings of the text, it becomes obvious (to me, at least). These texts were all pioneers in the field.  ;Yes, I see it now. Thank you. This was for Unit 3 - Dracula. The thread is posted under Unit 4 - Frankenstein. That was confusing me a bit The video must have been released after the first batch of them. I download all the videos and didn't have this one, but since going back and checking each unit, I found the video in question. Thanks for pointing this out.I see the dog (on the couch, behind our Professor). Very cute!;You're welcome Mary. I'm glad you enjoyed it!;Javier,I think the main point    Prof. Anne K. Mellor was trying to argue in her presentation was that going against nature tends to have  disastrous  effects. Only a woman can get pregnant, support life from her own body, and birth another human. A man does not have this capability (whether we consider this limitation as being due simply to biology or to divine law might be another interesting theme to explore, but beyond the scope of this post). I understand what you are saying here, that all humans have been born of women, that there have been some monstrous people in the past, so it follows that woman sometimes ""produce monsters"". However,  I don't think Mellor was trying to argue that if a person is born from a woman, he or she would therefore necessarily be good and  virtuous   I do think she was trying to argue that Mary Shelley might have been exploring the theme of an ""unnatural  creation"", the birthing of a creature by a man with no woman involved, a kind of   mockery of natural birth, and commenting on its disastrous  results.  ;That seems like a decent theme to explore Anon. There are threads in the forum where people are posting their essays to be reviewed beyond the ""official"" reviews we get during the unit. I'm on my way out the door, so unfortunately I do not have time to track down the specific links for you, but if you search the forum, you should find similar threads for each unit. Perhaps you will consider posting your essay to one of those threads for further review?;Greetings course mates,Is anyone out there considering revising your essays based on feedback from the peer reviews? The workload of this course is high, with the weekly readings, essay writing, and peer reviews, so I probably won't do any revisions until the end of the course, yet I am planning on doing revisions. I have a blog on Wordpress and will eventually post my revised essays there as part of a series on this course.Anybody else planning on doing something similar? I'd love to read your revised essays. I would even consider having you as a quest blogger on my blog and/or posting your essays there as well. Let me know if you are interested and we can stay in contact beyond this course.;Thanks Anonymous. I need to write more on the blog. This class is taking up a lot of my time with the readings and such, but I'm loving it. When it's over, I should be able to focus more on the blog (as well as having some material to revise and make a series of posts about). :PAlejandro, I like your blog. I'm going to follow it.  ;Thank you Alejandro. That article on Guatemala was written as one of my assignments in another course (Rhetorical Composing). I chose the topic myself. The assignment was  to compose a text intended for a public audience in which we engage an issue that we find worthwhile.  I was already familiar with the terrible tragedies done to the Ixil peoples from news reports on the Rios Montt trial and also from a friend in Mexico that sent me a documentary about the Maya. As I investigated further, I found many more sources to use. I eventually want to write a follow up article as well, as things further develop.I am in the US, but I have several online friends from Central and South America. I try to stay aware of things happening around the world, not just my own country. I also try to frequent alternative news sources (like Democracy Now!, for example), not just Fox and CNN. The internet makes it easier to have a broader view IMHO.  ;Florencia, I think it will be a great exercise for me to revise (and perhaps expand) the essays when the course is over. Good luck with yours, if you do it.Awesome Tegan. I will check out your blog. Thanks for sharing the link. I completely understand; the work load is heavy in this course. I won't be doing any revising until we are done here either. Yet, I definitely want to revise and expand on the essays, as well as writing additional essays for other books I read. For the last 7 or 8 years my reading has been mostly non-fiction on topics of interest to me. This course has reminded me of my first love, fiction/literature. My already ridiculously long ""to read"" list has grown exponentially longer now that I am exploring fiction titles again.;Tegan, that's funny! Bibliophiles like ourselves tend to have that never-ending-always-expanding reading list, no? I own more books than I do clothes (true story!).I gather from your blog that you are a librarian? Three cheers for all the libraries (and librarians) out there! Growing up, I discovered whole new worlds when my mom first took me to the library. It has been a love affair between me and books ever since.  Well, I hope you were able to get through the recommend readings for this unit, and write your essay, Advanced Reader Copy notwithstanding. ;);Olga, if you continue to have difficulties, you might consider trying OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Word. This is a free, open source office program that has a word processor and other apps in the suite as well. You can download it here.  I write my essays in OpenOffice, then copy and paste into the Coursera site, and haven't had any trouble with formatting, etc.Best of luck. Let us know if it keeps happening.  ;I think John is correct here. Though it is not commonly used this way now, it appears Hawthorne is using ""proficient"" in this sentence as a noun rather than an adjective. If this is so, then ""an eminent proficient..."" would mean something similar to John's rewording of ""an eminent expert..."";This is great Megan! Thanks for sharing that gem from Aaron Sorkin. I loved hearing how active he is when he writes (i.e. jumping up and down from his desk, etc.). His best advice, in my humble opinion, is the most obvious bit he offers at the very end of the note, ""Write the way you write"".  As for me, I used to use music as a background but that changed about 10 years ago or thereabouts. I love music just as much as poetry and literature, so when I play music I often lose myself in it, or find myself focusing on both the sounds and the lyrics, immersing myself in it all, being caught up in the specific emotions and/or memories any particular song might happen to evoke for me. Therefor, in regards to my own writing process, music actually becomes a distraction more often than not. I can't focus on writing because I am engulfed in the music, especially if the songs have lyrics. That said, if I am feeling uninspired I might take a break from writing and play some music, then go back to writing. Or I might take a walk in the woods, or visit a friend, or meditate. When I am writing, I work at my desk on a word-processor. Often it is in the middle of the night, when all is quiet except for the crickets (or rain, if it's raining. I love when it's raining! I keep the windows open, listen to the rain fall, smell the fresh air--very inspiring for me). The quieter it is in my room, the better. My mind drifts towards the story (or whatever I happen to be writing about). I alternate between writing, outlining, fleshing out ideas in my notebook and short breaks for something to drink and/or eat, play with my cat, then back to more writing. I always have to have a pack of cigarettes nearby as well. Horrible habit, I know, but yes, I am a smoker, and find that when I am writing, I smoke more.  Oh, and on your comment that ""Redundancy is a writer's best friend in a technology driven world"", I couldn't agree more. Horror of horrors, back in 2000 I wrote a series of short-stories that I was really happy with. I hadn't been writing for several years and these were the first ones to come through for me after a long pause. I wrote them all out in my word processor and then had a hard drive crash. I never had them backed up. I lost them all! Whoosh! Gone. Ever since, I make sure I back up my data, especially my writing folders. It took me a while to recover from that blow, to begin to think about writing again. It was, of course, my own damn fault for not backing them up, but that didn't make it any easier.  ;You didn't do anything silly Frederico. The selected readings for Unit 5 are on Hawthorne and Poe. You can write your essay on either of them, or both of them.  ;"

And within each country, there are many different dialects/accents and peculiar turns of phrase that differ region to region. English has become the lingua franca of our modern world. It has many forms, and has been adapted to local flavor wherever it has been taken up. This should be kept in mind when marking papers.  I would never personally mark down a paper for using proper English (whether American, British, or some other form).

I agree though, in the context of this course, it would be problematic to do this before the deadline for the reasons you list. Two possible suggestions I can think of are:1) create a study group on another platform (like Google Plus, Facebook, or an email list) and share drafts there for critique, feedback, suggestions, discussion, etc.2) stagger the revisions to be done after the deadline. This would still facilitate a means to revise essays, but would not effect the grade in this course (unless, perhaps, you take it a second time).;I have been reading since I was a child. Actually, my mom tells me she read to me even before I was born. It has been a love affair with books ever since. Early interests came from the genres of Fantasy, Horror and Science Fiction (I also love a lot of classic literature, but will skip that for this post as being possibly off topic).  Ray Bradbury's The Illustrated Man and Something Wicked This Way Comes, Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed, Stephen King's short story collection Night Shift, Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, Philip K. Dick's VALIS trilogy, R. A. Salvatore's Dark Elf trilogy, Piers Anthony's Xanth series and later his Tarot series, Andre Norton's Fur Magic,  Robert Anton Wilson's The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles, Neil Gaiman's  America Gods, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Frank Herbert's Dune series, Robert Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, H.P. Lovecraft's The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath...these, and so many other authors/books, have all been highly influential in my life, both as a reader and also as a writer.  ;This is an excellent essay Jeremy. I, for one, enjoy focused topics, especially so in these short essays. While I do think it is possible to include multiple themes, it takes great skill to pull that off in 320 words. A tight thesis, with supporting textual evidence, tends to make for a great short essay. You have done just that IMHO. Your examination of the unreliable narrator was insightful. You make me want to go back and re-read the text as I didn't pick this up the first time around. Bravo!;The Masque of the Red Death  seems to have been a popular story to include in the essays for this unit, even though it is not on the syllabus. I'll add my name to the list of reviewers here that received an essay on the Red Death. In this case, the student compared the Red Death with a Hawthorne story (that was on the reading list). I was torn with how to mark the essay. It was well written, intelligent, the thesis was argued well (and supported with examples from the texts), it was an original idea, BUT...half of the essay was based on a story we were not assigned!  Fellow students, please read the syllabus. It lists all the stories we are supposed to be reading. I would have loved to do an essay on the Red Death as well (one of my favorite Poe stories), but I didn't, because it is not part of the curriculum.  ;You had me thinking Paul. I just ran a plagiarism check on one of the essays I received, but...it turned up legit. I'm glad it did actually. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt, but understand that not everyone out there plays fair. :/;Javier, I like your theme. I also like how you brought in details from Poe's life. One thing I think that may have improved your essay is if you cited specific examples from one or more of the stories to support your thesis. While you do mention The Black Cat as well as The Tell-Tale Heart,  perhaps you could have included direct quotes from these stories to support your thesis rather than summarizing in your own words. Just a suggestion. Also, did you include an entry in the Works cited section, for where you got your info about Poe?  This theme of Death makes me think of the following song from Blue Oyster Cult, (Don't Fear) The Reaper. :)  ;Indeed, more cowbell! LOL.;Hi Anon,This is an interesting analysis of The Black Cat. I particularly liked your treatment of color symbolism in the text, and noting the reference to mythology (the cat being named Pluto, and how that is significant). You might consider deciding on an interpretation and sticking with it to strengthen your argument. In the essay, you appear to propose several different interpretations (especially in the conclusion). This can give the impression that you are not really sure which interpretation makes the most sense to you. If you decide on one, and then follow up in your essay with supporting evidence for it, this might improve the overall effect of your analysis.  As peer 1 mentioned under form, there are some errors with language, wording, grammar, etc. Not enough that I couldn't follow your ideas though. Yet here are some suggestions that may be helpful for you (suggestions are in bold):""The novel  Black cat  has associations with demons and witchcraft; and  makes you question where the origins of evil dwell.""""Cats, especially black  ones,...""""...while changing a  person   s character.""""...whilst  a [or  the]  devil is nourished with evil deeds,  the  pet is affectionate to its owner, but once it is offended,  it  sets fire in the house.""""...that  man himself was transforming into  a [or  the]    devil,...""""This transformation required bigger sins      the  murder of loved ones, which started with Pluto.""""Taking out an eye can be associated to the cat   s night vision, which is symbolic of  seeing a  world of impurities. This  intimidates the  main character so  that his evil side might be detected.""""...the cat has a  clear relation with the wife.""""The second cat has a  spot on it's fur,...""""...and the  wife   s white hair is  reminiscent  of this, provoking further evilness.""""The white itself is a  ghostly color, or perhaps it is related to purity, and a  sense of the need to taint it.""""Also, the  wife defends the pet with her bare hands against an  axe, and is not offended by the ill- temper of her husband, which raises suspicion that she might have deeper relations to the causes...""""We can consider a  few different conclusions - either the cat is the cause of demonic behavior, the wife is a witch, or the man is at fault.""      ;You're welcome Anon. I know if I was writing in a language other than my primary language, I would like to have suggestions to my form. I applaud you for taking a course like this if English is not your first language. I can only imagine what a challenge that would be for me. Hat's off to you for doing it! :)Regarding my comments about choosing one interpretation, let me clarify a bit. I don't mean to say that you should only stick to one single aspect or view of the text. Yet, the way your essay was written, it comes across as a bit noncommittal. What I mean is, you seem to be saying, ""Well, it could be this, or maybe it's this, or maybe this"" and it gives the impression you aren't really convinced it is any of them. And your reader comes away thinking the same thing (i.e. maybe it's none of these?) That is just how I read it, and I might be totally off the mark here. And I mean no offense. Just offering some friendly feedback for consideration.  Since these essays are so short (320 words), we don't really have a lot of space to flesh out our arguments. It is possible to include several aspects to our interpretations, but these would have to be written very concisely. I don't know, maybe if you tied all three together into a unifying argument somehow, that would have worked well.  Happy reading and writing!;Efthymia, I enjoyed reading your essay. I like the balance you struck between direct quotations from the text and your own analysis. I have to disagree with your peer 3 on this (no offense to peer 3 if you are reading this). Your use of quotatoins is well founded, and blends perfectly with your own ideas. Great job.;Poulomi,This is an interesting feminist critique of these stories, well written and well argued.   Good job.As an aside, is it reverse discrimination to assume the killer in The Tell Tale Heart is a man? lol. Well, probably not because at the time Poe was writing there were very few known reports of women killers, with some rare exceptions (for example,   see Elizabeth Bathory from the 17th century).  ;Thanks for the clarification Greg.

I reviewed an essay for this unit that included this story. I felt it was an excellent essay. I would have awarded a 6, but gave a 5 instead (3 for form, and a 2 for content because of this issue).

It's a great pleasure (if not a bit daunting) to see the first posts which such insightful comments.  There also is something quite deep about the idea of, how Theodossi put it, what is real.

Best of luck! ;Hello Carol, I've also read this series (haven't read the fifth one yet no spoilers!) and must agree the authors use of different driving voices for each chapter offers unique perspective.   The author also uses a great way of having facts of the story diluted by each characters perspective, for example: (spoilers!) the dragons returning, most characters seem to take it as pure rumor and myth yet he has shown the reader that it is a fact. Using these types of rumors and perspective gives the reader a fantastic way of truly witnessing what each character experiences whether they be right or wrong. Also his use of morality is interesting. Most of the characters may wish for the world to be black and white but as shown with characters like Cersei Lannister and Catleyn Stark who are similar (mothers, daughters of powerful houses, willing to go to extreme lengths to protect their children) yet also have key differences (beauty, honor, a loving marriage) show the great conflict within the world and that it is all grey. Where one woman is shown to be honorable and trust worthy and the other ruthless and cunning yet both are protecting their children by whatever means (maybe the queen wants to retain her position but honestly, who wouldn't?) Jim ;Dominick, First of what an enlightening post. Well thought out and caused me to pause and contemplate my response. Now that my adulations are out of the way the matter at hand. Martins use of the ""family house"" is a great way to equate the pressures of blind loyalty. If someone is born into something they are inevitably shaped by it. Which is why most people find Arya such a compelling character. She seems to forgo all the family ties (she struggles with this but who wouldn't) and goes on her own, albeit bumpy, path. Someone who doesn't want to be shaped by what she was born into but wants to be who she is. In fact, reflecting on the series as a whole he has  an interesting way of writing female characters. Look at the vast differences between Arya and Sansa, or the queen and Catleyn. Dany and Brienne. All of them strong characters in different ways, it's inspiring. (Even frustrating for an aspiring author). Which lends a bit of lesson to the world that these women are powerful and are shaping the world even if they are looked down upon on their sex. A good point for our modern world to pick up on. ;Exactly! That sort of ambiguity concerning morality is especially rare in fantasy settings where there are tons of mindless evils. Indeed, there is a sort of mindless evil in the white walkers but the true driving force is the characters moral compass being completely understandable and even relatable. How does everyone feel on his use of magic? I love and hate it. It's eluded to and kept away from the reader mostly but, when shown, isn't fully understood and the author seems to be keeping the reader in the dark, almost indefinitely, on the inner workings of the magic of westeros. ;Hmm how interesting. I will have to pick the series up again after this course ends. I did notice he used a good bit of foreshadowing during the scene (spoiler) when Dany entered the house of the undying she witnessed one vision in particular of a man with a wolfs head and a crown upon its brow. And we all know what happened to Robb Stark at the red wedding. I may be forced to reread all four entries now. Thanks a ton! ;"

Anyone else have this issue? ;How unfortunate, the peer reviewing is what makes this class. I appreciate your offer Scott! Here we go:  Edgar Allen Poe filled his poem ""The Raven"" with a myriad of symbols and themes. Perhaps the most powerful imagery is that of the title character sitting atop the bust of Pallas, which in turn is above a door. These symbols represent the dangers of knowledge and the dominance the raven has on the main characters mind.   The importance of knowledge is alluded to in the first several lines while the narrator is ""pondering"" and reading through a ""tome of forgotten lore"". This helps establish that the main character was attempting to learn or gain enlightenment of his own accord, until he is interrupted by the raven.    After the arrival of the raven, it perches itself on the bust of Pallas. Pallas, which is another name for Athena, is the Greek goddess of knowledge. The bird then dominates the scene, resting itself atop a deity that represents knowledge as it lords itself over the narrator. The author uses this to showcase the dominion the raven has over the narrators psyche, for when it enters it is the object of all his focus. Furthermore, the door, which is directly under the bust, could also be a metaphor for the abyss, for when the narrator opens the door and sees that it wasn't a human knocking he is said to peer into darkness and begins    wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;      Consequently, these symbols when pieced together show a rather disturbing image. A man, searching for answers, becomes enraptured by the raven who he thinks has some unseen knowledge. The narrator is thrown into the darkness of the abyss, that was previously outside his chamber, as he falls to the floor under the shadow of Pallas and the raven. Our narrator seeks to understand, to acquire the knowledge, of what ""nevermore"" means and is driven insane over-thinking the infamous quote.

I'd read Perrault's fairy tales recently (before signing up for this course) and it's interesting to see how they differ.   In Perrault's version of The Sleeping Beauty, they don't live happily ever after after she's woken up but the Sleeping Beauty has to contend with a jealous mother-in-law once she's married - I like the tales that break this ""happily ever after"" idea.   I know it's repetitive but I like how there are so many similar stories (like Mother Hulda and The Three Little Men In The Wood), that have obviously been collected from different places but have probably  evolved from an original story, just like nowadays you have the Disney version of fairy tales competing with other versions.   So you think of these Grimms' tales as the original but really they're probably only versions of original stories that were passed down verbally.;"

Now that I think of that, the transfer of oral tradition into the written form might have been really meaningful - if before (grand)parents decided which stories the child was ready to hear based on their maturity and personal qualities, how to narrate and explain them, which details to highlight or omit, what is printed in a book is much closer to being set in stone for anyone to read and draw their independent conclusion. And these are the stories I wouldn't like my children to interpret on their own;Isn't it about this time that the cost of printing starts to drop? Gutenberg printing was""t exactly for the masses.

Never forget the process ;Does anyone else resist the idea of taking notes, in favor of letting the mind wander in the the worlds as one proceeds?   Perhaps especially for these fairy tales, perhaps it is that the reading is done within a few days, but I feel almost like taking notes might be intrusive on my subconscious enjoyment and stirring of ideas.     Of course there are some times I am driven to write something down, but that is usually a result of the stirring, rather than notes for notes sake.I am a little bit procrastinating because of this....I think...conflicted, maybe. I don't want to proceed with the idea that I am ""supposed to take notes"" as opposed to doing it naturally, for my own reasons.  Anyone else?   Or anyone have any thoughts? probably silly altogether. normally I make a lot of notes...signed, conflicted idealist in need of coffee;The Grimm Collection of tales only says that it is that. As Disney takes public domain stories and tells them, the Disney collection is unique, so does the Grimm Brothers, as well as the translators of each edition. None of these  are the verbal versions, and none are the verbal versions that would have been those of any particular person, family, town, or area.It's a collection, the meaning of which is in the grouping itself as well as the content. Imagine in some families one might have heard only the tales such as the Six Soldiers or The Gallant Tailor, where one might aspire to greatness from lowly beginnings, and perhaps not be quite perfectly fair in doing so. In other families one might hear only tales of warning not to be greedy, or other things of value to their own personal history.I am curious to hear Prof Rabkin on the reason for the collection. I am resisting the temptation to look it up, in the spirit of the course syllabus and order of things:)   I imagine that it is quite different from, say Disney Corp's reason for their collection (""buy things! aspire to buy things! Be good, and serve well, and you will be able to buy things!"" (and let's not forget ""brave is good, but also be sexy, girls!"");I've come to think that these tales are more like observations on life and people, like a sociology lesson, or how the world works. Perhaps the character development needed in the locale of each tale, or version, varied, depending on whether ones local king or queen (or local leaders) were kind and generous, or horrid and cruel and to be avoided.   Thus in some stories we see that getting away with what you can is fair enough and one gets away with it, as in   'Six Soldiers of Fortune', as opposed to faithfulness, service and loyalty   to the point of self sacrifice, win the day as in 'Faithful John' , where we might imagine that the local King would have been worthy of supporting to such great lengths, and thus we pass these qualities on as desirable in this location and time.I found myself wondering about what the local civilization was like from story to story, how they might live, what they value, what is acceptable, what is worthy, or not,   given the tale told.;True, although it was that his actions that were morally questionable and still won the day for our Jack-of-all-trades.   So we can assume that what is valued there in the locale and time of this tale,   would be to fight for what is right and deserved at all costs, the ends justifies the means. Not all societies agree that the end justifies the means. There is some greed in our 'hero' in Six Soldiers, for example, as he takes all of the kingdom's gold, that here is acceptable, where in an other story, that might be his downfall.;The story begins with Hans telling his master that he is finished with his seven years, and wants only to go see his mother. He asks for his wages   only so that he can be on his way to her.The value of the gold to the employer shows what he thought of Hans' work, as did his words ""You have served me truly and faithfully,"" and ""as the service is, so must the wages be"". So we see Hans as a worthy character to be admired. If we take that into consideration, then perhaps we can view   that Hans is truly 'in luck' whether he perceives it and we do not, or he perceives it and it is true (or not).   I think it may well be about how 'luck' is things that come along at the right place and right time, and also a matter of perception and character, ones outlook on life.   After all, in Hans' eyes, he enjoyed everything he traded for, and when he began to not enjoy it, he easily found something to exchange it for, bringing him new happiness again.These threads about the stories are fun and thought provoking, I can't wait to read the essays:);I do think that the story's intention is as you say. Otherwise we might have heard at the end of the mothers lament at the loss of the gold. As that is not mentioned, it probably should not be implied, except perhaps in one's own version of the story, when told anew:);I wonder if this point will make a difference to how anyone views Hans- he is not in fact ""quitting his job"", but rather reached the end of his traditionally 7 year long apprenticeship, where one learns a trade and aids their mentor in exchange for food and lodging. Traditionally they would be given something for their service, almost a token of luck, to help them begin their new life working at what they've just apprenticed at.So, Hans did not simply quit and wander on home, it was the end of his term of servitude for the apprenticeship.;It seemed to me that it was a tale of how a lot of   greedy characters and their own self interest will cause a venture to fail.   They were all willing to help in exchange for something before they would help, and in the end they all failed and it was their undoing. You can have as many half-hearts half helping as you wish, but you will all fall to a bad fate if the most important thing is their selfishness.;I agree with Gustavo, using personal feelings to illustrate points can be effective. Especially if you are so driven to share your fear that you are exploring it here on the forums, it may well be relevant and worth writing about. Write it, see it it does enrich the attentive fellow student, and use your judgement. ;As I read through all of the discussions, with good back and forth between everyone on the stories,I see many wonderful thoughts and   opinions, different views of the story or stories that are valuable to the discussion.I am hoping that when we do our peer reviews, we will be open to the views of others, and judge the essays on whether they enrich the readers experience rather than whether or not we agree with the writers assessment.Also, though we are graced with many talented people, including teachers in our midst, I hope that it is remembered that we are not all Doctoral students,teachers, nor perfect in our English.  ;Mark, that is so ironic, your post sounds just like a Grimm story!(does that make you curious?);oh the illustrations are beautiful, and worthy of some attention:) if you can see the copy provided here just for those, do!  ;Thank goodness for this thread!

I had my own idea about the purpose of the tales in general, and that's what I wrote about.

That said, a lot of human adornments; and even normal secondary sexual characteristics could be said to be biologically subliminal or indirect; so it might be hard to  separate  unconscious copying of biologically subliminal imagery into artesan vs a deliberate inclusion of manipulative imagery...If you mean that the creator knew (purposeful inclusion) and the reader/viewer didn't  consciously  realise it then I would guess that would probably have been at the very birth of language.

Our time is so limited and every day, especially when we have a family to care. I listened all the courses while I was ironing. I was very happy for that, I can continue learning and this is very important for me.Beside that, concerning the Grimm tales, I believe that listening is very important. These stories were told orally, as Sharla also mentioned above. This means that they have techniques for mnemonic and retain the interest of their audience: ""one, two, three... go!"", the are  rhythmic, they include easy to remember verses, they have simple descriptions, etc.In our days the story tellers are lost. We are reading more than we are listening (as we speak more than we are sing...). We are trained to read, our mind can retain more details, make combinations,   the words are images to  mark with a  highlighter...   For this reason we, the authors, can not continue  writing as before 2oo years. In my opinion (and this is a thought that is just growing up) we must find the simplicity of the old tales for the reader of our days. For this reason, it is important, not only to listen, but also to read the same tale, to see if there any difference in our understanding.This discussion I like. As a child I have memories from listening tales (or songs). We had no television, we were listening only radio and the time of the story was important, we were waiting the whole week for a friend of our grandmother to tell us the story. Now, I am so tired from all the images, photos, screens (computers), cameras, around me, and I looking the pleasure of that period, of simple words, and of listening (or singing).For the dilemmas (another nice greek word), there is only solution: do both! Only heroes have to chose one way, like Hercules. In our modern world, we can have more.Have a nice day all.;I visited the samples of previous students. Very useful, thank you for the information. Most of them discuss the plot. I think remarks concerning techniques of creative writing can be included, such as ""plot points"", ""the relation of the beginning with the end"", ""repetitive patterns"", ""environment"", ""time"", ""space"", ""the evolution of the  hero through the story"" (he/she changes?), etc. Sharing, I agree is very important. Have a nice day.;The number three I think is something more basic related with the way we understand the world, we can't explain it. I feel it is related the way I started walking. One: right step, Two: left step, Three: right again. We can't stop at number two, we have a movement and this needs the number three to stabilize ourselves.  From the other side, first time when something happens is nothing. Second time it is something to notice. Third time, we must react, else this will continue for ever.I made many thoughts, also, about number seven. See the Miller' s Law   ""...  the number of objects an average person can hold in working memory is about seven..."".  ;Dear Anastasiya, one  psychologue told us that when the children listen about bad heroes they feel better for their ""bad thoughts"", they think they are not so bad if for example they pushed their little sister, because there are much worse actions in the tales.   Is this also the reason that we love these stories? An interesting question.;Very interesting your post. Written stories are for readers and oral stories are for listeners. There have common, but also differences. As you mentioned in oral tales memorizing techniques must be issued. The same techniques are for an oral presentation in public: emphasize the basic points, repeat the essentials many times, use a simple language, strong descriptions: Black, White, Red (no Pinks...).;Very interesting your questions.  Below some thoughts.Why does everyone die?It just happens. The tales don't give an answer, a reason for that. Also, there is not life after death, no one returns back. The real life...  Why the cock doesnt feel angry: You are right, in the tales only those who have the power are getting angry (king, queen), the others no, they have to survey.What are all those animals at the end: The others... We...  ?Did you guys notice that all of these animals from the list were listed like a chain of food?  No, but if so, this shows that there is an ""architecture"". Generally, after the repetitive starting: one... two... three... the stories seem that they don't follow a design, the beginning doesn't prepare us for the end. For example, in the ""white snake"" at the beginning there are many words linked to sound/birds: noised air, voices, listened ... Then, there are birds, but where is the snake?    We find it again as memory in the tree of life (Paradise), but this is not so clear. I would like to see it, also in the middle of the story, stronger relations. May be this is normal, because they are stories ""written"" by many story tellers, and Grimm collected this oral tradition. We must not expect a very well organised plot of the stories.  ;"

I like the old editions of books recommended for the seminar, I feel comfortable with their margins, the pictures, the economy in the use of colour, the type, everything is so well placed in its place. The illustrations of these old books are also carefully designed and sometimes analysing these we can understant more, especially about the symbols included into the story. This happens because the illustrator had a relation with the author? The illustrations of the ""Little Prince"" were made by the author:  Saint-Exup  ry.  ;Very interesting your question, because refers to ""what is fantastic?"". Generally, we could say that all stories are products of our fantasy, only history is not (or should not...). I think that the fantastic is when happens something unreal, and this unreal changes the story. For example, in Disney's Mickey Mouse, of course the heroes are fantastic, there is not any duck speaking, but this doesn't change the story, like the magic horse's head as in the Grimms' ""Goose Girl"", who helps at the recognition of the princess by speaking. I am wondering if ""Asterix and Obelix"" comics are fantastic, because there is of course the magic   portion that helps them, but the stories are true (or almost).

But I think that Mina's character can be better related to the ancient Roman goddess of wisdoms: Minerva.  From the 2nd century BC onwards, the Romans equated her with the Greek  goddess  Athena  who was involved into the myth of Medusa.;And also Athena (Minerva) had the head of Medusa with her. For me, the story was also the fight of the mind with the physical power. The mind is also the science and the physical power is the primitive (old) way to succeed. I put these in a line:Dracula - physical power---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Medusa - mindThis line can also be seen as:Dracula - father----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Medusa-mother(Dragon' etymology is: ""Watching well"" and Meduca's is: ""dominate"" and ""care"" in ancient Greek).I thought that all the characters take positions into this line, and trying to find themselves they move; who reached the limits they died (lost) .  The child-mind (so nice!) searches his/her sexuality.  I felt fear when it was said it was Lucy who took the children, not with Dracula so much. I think that in our culture, mother can't hurt her children. Mina at the end asks ""Why are you  afraid  of me?""In Greek Mythology we known Medea who killed her children too. It is interesting that Medea's etymology is the same with Medusa's. Freud had an essay concerning Medusa's Head.  After the essay I think all these and I find more. I liked this story a lot.  ;Why not? Very possibly. Greek gods came from other civilizations;  with Egypt they were so close. It is very interesting that there is a female ""good""  goddess everywhere. That means our deep necessity to have a ""mother"" who loves and protects us. A ""bad"" mother, we can't accept, unless she is a step-mother. I had the chance to have a very good mother. Like Lucy, I had difficulties to be separated from her. Now, 10 years after I lost her, I can understand more this strong relationship. As a mother too (I have 2 daughters and 1 son), I hope that I'll leave them free to make their own lives. My father was  absent, but he was a good father. I didn't feel fear from Dracula, but from the female  vampires; for Dracula I felt sympathy like Mina. Also, I appreciate a lot the power of the mind. I  believe  that  knowledge  can help people. So,  I am Mina more than Lucy? So many questions, so many (no) answers.

So, when I read, I try to analyze my feelings, I am looking to find an architecture into the text. I like the essays that open me a window to see through it more into the text: another aspect. I am looking for techniques that makes the story interesting, and when I have an idea I am trying to find more evidences into the text, like to a detective. May be I don't have high scores in my essays, but the important for me is that I am learning from all this process to communicate better with others.Have a nice day.;I   am closer to Alan's opinion. The essay must help the ""attentive and intelligent student"" to understand deeply the text. This doesn't mean necessary that I, the teacher, must tell him my opinion. It is more to show him a way to think, a methodology.  ;"

It was really ugly or Frankenstein found it ugly?Frankenstein created a human, but when his creature came to life, he realized its ugliness and ran away from it, totally terrified, unable to love it.   He tried a lot: he studied philosophy and sciences; he worked like an    artist   : he collected beautiful parts of other human beings and he joined these proportionally, and also, he worked intensively, with enthusiasm, deeply concentrated on  his task.  But, Christian God was very happy and satisfied after the creation of Adam  [1]. Why is Frankenstein so unhappy about his Creature?In chapter V, the  Creature says the reason of his failure: ""Adam had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator. [  _] my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance   .  We understand that Creature is ugly because of Frankenstein's ugliness projection to it. But what is beauty?  Frankenstein was not physically ugly.  Is there a beauty that we can reach by keeping well defined aesthetic lows (as seen with our eyes), or   is it about an internal ""Beauty"", that comes out from our eyes,  formed  as a result of love, friendship, and especially from our offer to other people? (Plato [2], Plotinus [3].)It seems that Mary Shelley looks for such a definition of Beauty [4]. In many cases, she draws our attention into the eyes expression, where we can find the person's character. Frankenstein looks into Creature's ""watery eyes"", but sees nothing, because he sees himself, like Narcissus [5], who is empty.  His deep desire to achieve a big discovery turned him egoistically to himself: no friends, no family, no love. He reached his goal to make a big achievement, but this was not  in profit of the humanity. Unlike ""old Prometheus"" [6] who scarified himself to make human's life better, Frankenstein   s lack of love created a monster.  References[1]  ""Let us make humankind  in our image, according to our likeness [  _] God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good   , The Bible, Genesis.[2]  Plato (428-347 BCE), Greek philosopher.[3]  Plotinus(204-270 CE), major philosopher  of the ancient world.[4] Mary Shelley's handsband, Percy Bysshe Shelley,  made the translation of:  Plato,  The Banquet(1818).  Shelley was an accomplished Hellenist, and had a natural sympathy for Plato's way of seeing the world.[5] Narcissus (Greek Mythology)  was looking at his reflection in the lake.[6] Prometheus (Greek Mythology)  gifted humanity with fire.;Hi all. This is my essay. It had got a 5. I am happy for this. For me it is important the idea that we can't see beauty if we don't have an internal beauty. Of course there is the parameter of ""love"", love makes us feeling the beauty, and if this happens we are happy. I love this course, because makes me thinking all these beautiful things. Have a nice day! (from Greece).;Dear Florencia it seems that you are right. I have to read the book again, where others, Felix, Agatha and Safle see the Creature, what happens exactly. We must take into consideration that the Creature talks; what he says is viewed from his point of view: he  believes  to his ugliness, so he thinks  that this is the cause of other's rejection. If you are interested in this subject, read the following article:  Facing the Ugly: The Case of ""Frankenstein"". I didn't cited it because it refers to another philosopher' ideas.With art, a lot of times I say: ""I feel the beauty in my stomach"", not ""see"". A perfect painting or a photo may tell us nothing. An artist must have something to say with his art; as artists, we create what we are; we can reach beauty, not only with our technique (which helps to the communication), but also with our personality and ideas. So, beauty is more than knowledge. Knowledge can be achieved with learning, but beauty needs also our soul. some questions:Is beauty personal?  Is there a ""classic"" beauty as it is expressed  for example  in an ancient Greek statue?  Why Aphrodite of Venus is beautiful? (She couldn't be in our days a top model, I think...)Aphrodite  of Venus, Louvre Museum;Dear Jeremy, I was your peer 1. For me it was a ""6"". I found your essay: simple, clear and interesting.

Good luck to all of us who are looking for the Beautiful, and we feel a little artists (not Artists).;As a not native English speaker, I have many difficulties too; I have to look at the dictionary all the time... But, we can't stop...;At my first essays I used to give citations from  Wikipedia;   I thought that the reviewer can find easier the information that I mentioned into my text. One reviewer told me that it is better to have more original citations, so now  I prefer to find the original article. But, In my opinion, If I really used Wikipedia, I think it is more ""fair"" to tell it; the time is so limited, we don't have the possibility to find the original sources. Also, for the essay of this week, I found many published in journals but I didn't have access to read the articles.;I have essays to review that are the abstracts of the stories. I don't think that an ""intelligent"" and ""attentive"" student needs that. Although, I understand the difficulties; for me the readings of this week were very difficult.;"

It's good to read the whole lot I think and then concentrate on a particular theme or aspect.http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fantasysf/Documents/WorkExpectations.htmlAbout the essays it says'Your essays should aim to enrich the reading of a fellow student who is both intelligent and attentive to the readings and to the course. Each essay should be between 270 and 320 words. Attentive readers notice more than casual readers do, although casual readers may be responding unconsciously to many of the matters that attentive readers notice consciously. This difference in reading awareness arises in part from the fact that attention is limited. If I am attentive to the use of triples in fairy tales (three brothers on a quest, three questions testing the hero, and so on), then I might find that I   m not consciously attentive to other aspects of the narrative (the comparative intrinsic worth or worthlessness of the object of the quest, the rhetorical construction of a testing question, and so on). Because attention is limited, to understand works more deeply we need to slow down and take note of aspects of the reading that we find significant. Then, using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be. For example, if one notices that fairy godmothers occur only for child protagonists whose biological mother is dead, one might hypothesize that, at least psychologically, the fairy godmother takes the role of a mother and the fairy godmother   s entrance in a story is a promise of the love and protection that the protagonist has had taken away. The fairy godmother, then, is not so much a figure of magic as her magic is a metaphor for the continuing power of motherhood.Writing these essays and reading and commenting on the essays of your fellow students should make you much better prepared to learn from, and even question, the unit clips.

Once we feel confident about that, any other resources or links would enrich our understanding of the   broader context around the work.;I'm not going to use any supplemental texts unless/until we get a firm answer on this, but in the past, I dealt with the issue by writing my essay first, and then scanning supplemental materials to see if I'd *missed* something (or worse, completely misinterpreted something!). Having said that, one of my English teachers in high school ""caught"" me checking out Cliffs Notes for The House of Seven Gables at the local public library and was aghast that one of her best students would resort to such a thing! Fortunately, I was in another teacher's class at that time, and trying to get to grips with *summer* reading... and I was nearly in tears trying to figure out what on earth he was on about. So she very kindly took an hour out of her day to explain the finer points of Hawthorne to me. I still hate Hawthorne with a passion, but I also still adore that teacher. I was lucky enough to have her again for AP English the following year, and she ended every class by making sure she had done her job well enough, and got us thinking about the material on our own enough, that none of us had to do something so horribly *gauche*   and *unimaginative* as resort to Cliffs Notes/Spark Notes. :);That is so awesome!

I am so going to have to go over this list once I get home and can hit up the library. Muhahahaha. *ahem*;I love Tolkien and Hobb!! Can't wait to start more of Hobb's books soon!;I love reading, especially fantasy books. There are books I have read many times, but when I fall in love with a book, I fall quickly and hard. When it comes to fantasy and science fiction, I adore The Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and lately I fell in love with Anne Bishop's The Black Jewels Trilogy.  ;I read an overabundant amount of poetry. In fact, I never feel like I read too many books which I'd like to change. My favorite are Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman, Maya Angelou, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Gray, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, Gwendolyn Bennett. I'm really hoping to expand and start reading more books. ;Fav authors: Isaac Asimov and Terry Pratchet. Favorite genres: horror, sci-fi/fantasy, ghost stories, and the classics. Many of the books that we are suppose to read, I've already read at one point. I remember reading Dracula in jr high. And that was a while ago. It was an abridged version of it. I've read Lewis Carroll's works, Grimms Fairy Tales, and reread Frankenstein in the past 3 years.

I am very excited to get started. As I already read quite slowly, I was wondering if you could let us know what specific tales by the Brother's Grimm we will be discussing. I was not able to get the version suggested in the notes but I own a volume of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales. I am not sure which tales overlap. I have been reading them in the evenings with my children but I would like to be sure to pay special attention to those that we will be discussing.;Thank you! That is a beautiful edition of these tales.;Thanks a lot! Librivox is almost always very good, though occasionally the old adage of ""You get what you pay for"" rings painfully true. ;I had the same problem and couldn't finish the course last time. My daughter unenrolled me by mistake and I was unable to enroll again.I plan to re-submit my essays, except for a couple I wasn't very happy with. Fortunately, I guess, I didn't see the lectures for most of the course so can't be influenced by them.I don't think you can have self-plagiarism, can you?;I am seriuoslt bummed that I need to bail out of this course. I believe that it is the perfect amalgamation between two of my great loves; writing and the inner working of the human mind but unfortunately I have dished too much into my plate at this time and as this is the most recent addition it is also the one that must take it's place on the back burner. Anything worth doing is worth doing right so I can't risk neglecting this course as a result of my other obligations or vice versa. I wish you all luck in the course and have added it to my watchlist so that i can be sure to hop on next time it comes around. But may I attempt at opening up a discussion before I leave? For interests sake. Why did you enroll in this course and what do you hope to learn from it? I was personally hoping to see if I could determine how external influences ( economic, geographic etc) could influence a writer. As well as the relationship between both science fiction and science fact and our need for fantasies as a society. I'm certain that you may believe that I am over reaching in my expectations of this course but I am certain that at least some of this may come to light, if not from the material then from the community involvement through Peer Responses and Forum posts.;try getting the files (books) in epub, mobi or azw, most of them are avaible in the links this site recomends, then you just open them on your kindle for pc with no problem, also you may try the calibre software to convert some of the files to formats the kindle and other e reading software use.mozilla Firefox has an e-reader that may come in handy in the future if the problem persists.  Calibre linkhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download_windowsSome of the books may be found here in e book formathttp://www.gutenberg.org/;I found this to be an interesting tale, too. I especially liked how the little lies she told just fell perfectly into place, as if she had been planning such a prank for years.;The Grimm tales haven't been part of my upbringing. I have read them as a part of the college curricula. I have been reading them again and I have enjoyed reading of 'Six Soldiers of Fortune'. It is very rhythmic story, I felt.  ;I had to go back and reread that section.   Notice how very delicately they mention that they were married for a while, and the prince came to her at a time of day when the witch wouldn't be there... ;);My version is a little different? He asked her to marry him but she said ""I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out. When thou comest, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the tower, and thou shalt take me away on thy horse."" Naughty naughty!;But consider the question she asks the witch that gives her away:""Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the King's son is with me in a moment?""Clearly, though she can't climb down, he is not having any trouble climbing up!;I agree with both of you, however, I would like to point out a few things. Sci-fi was in it's own right a fantasy, an imagining of the possibilities of technology. But as we progressed closer to the reality of these fantasies, I feel that authors, screenwriters and even artists became too concerned with making their imagined 'technologies' more credible so that it could stand up to the scrutiny of their fanbase. So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science. Which is why I feel that the resurgence of steampunk has become so prevalent. Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.;It interests me that SFF like Mieville's seems to go back to the early fantastic/weird tales of Jules Verne and co., and that Steampunk's really flowering.  ;Yes, glad to know. I hop e to be able to do this course. It's th e end of tehe schoolyear and I have to read final papers and tests from my students.Fortunatilly I've read mostra of th e books.Ser you in class;Yeah, I also saw it. My guess is they are left from the previous course.  ;Lol ... pleased others saw this.   I almost unenrolled thinking that I made the error!   Oh well, no doubt they'll get fixed up as soon as Prof sees this thread!;It seems to me the Professor is referring to the human ability of thinking up something they would like (or fear) to meet in the real life instead of fantasy as a genre of fiction. As an ability of mind, fantasy is necessary to produce any work of fiction, fantasy and science fiction just being the genres where this is the most evident. This is the way I understood the statement.;Thank you very much for explaining this to me.I understand how large the class is and of course the professor and staff are not going to grade everyone's essays (sorry, Emily, doesn't happen that way).In the Greek and Roman Mythology course, we also have to do at least five peer reviews (many of us decided to do more). These assessments were only counted as that we did them. The grades given by peers are not in any way reflected in the final grade. An assignment is considered completed when an essay is written, submitted, and the writer responds to at least five peer essays.To me, that is a much better solution. It is not a matter of getting lucky with peer reviewers, it is an ethical wrongdoing that goes against everything I have learned through my education courses and as a teacher myself.  ;Katrina, I feel like you may be feeling like you have your back up against a wall, especially as a result of some unhelpful anonymous comments. I'm not upset at all by your comments. I was struck by your strong objections to it as a grading schema. My comments are not meant as an attack in any form, more of a ""she's  making interesting points, I want to know more.""   My comments were intended as offering another way of thinking about the grading scheme. I'm a social scientist at heart so I'm thoroughly interested in effects of and reactions to educational processes. Peer review and its relationship to fostering skills and community are topics of great interest to me professionally. Can you talk more about what your ethical objections to peer review are? Is there a system you think would work more effectively (please see my comments about fear of robots with a grading schema like the Mythology course)? ;I was wondering about the whole peer review process at first, first of all afraid there would be too few people signed up for the course, second of all that the others would be.....um.....not likely to be helpful? is that the best way to put it?.....but look at the introductions, we have a LOT of people that we should be HONORED to get their opinions on our work, and I think we will get a lot of value out of this course.   I was wondering, though--if there are any outstanding essays, will they be shared with the rest of us?   ;Yes, they do. Amazing to think of how many are taking this course, over 30,000 on my previous course! Really looking forward to learning with the Professor.;In my experience from previous Coursera-courses, peer assessment as part of the final grade works fine. :) I am under the impression that people do evaluate others in the same way they hope that others evaluate them - fairly and thoughtfully. So I wouldn't worry too much about this right now. If you do feel however that you're repeatedly getting very unfair feedback, then you should of course bring it up again later. For now I'd say that there is no reason to worry.;Thank you, Anonymous, for that example.  ;Thank you all for your input. I really did not mean to spark a heated debate, and for that, I am sorry. Frankly, I am surprised at how many people are okay with this system and at some of the comments I received just from asking a question. I always thought I was a progressive educator, but there are some things in which I will not budge. At this point, we must agree to disagree.  I am glad I made someone laugh at least, if nothing else. Happy  reading all!;Hey guys. I hope i'm doing the right thing in exposing my thesis here.I'm hoping for some input, because I don't want to be overly confident about this and then find out there were a bunch of loop holes.  Reading the book I started to notice a difference in the roles played by luck and virtues in the stories where the hero is a man depending on the male's social status.   In other words, whenever the hero is a common man, be it a tailor or a soldier, he's role as a hero is only established through trials and the use of some skill or virtue. On the other hand, princes or ""king's sons"", as it is usually put, barely need any virtues for luck is always on their side. Take the princes in Rapunzel and Briar Rose, for exemple. The first one happens upon   the tower where the beautiful girl is trapped and is lucky enough to catch the enchantress calling the girl and climbing the tower. Not only that, after falling from the tower and having his eyes pierced, has the luck of bumping into his beloved now in the desert and having his ailments permanently cured. The second one is just lucky enough to find the castle just as the hundred year curse had expired and the thorns posed no danger anymore.The only example I found that might contradict this theory is ""The Frog-prince"", in which the prince had to use his cunning to have the princess keep her promise and break his spell. Although this is true, one can argue that this character is not really a prince, as his title was stripped from him, along with his luck, when he was turned into a creature that was less than human.So far, this is what I have. Can I get some comments from you guys? Am I on the right track?;I guess Gulliver's Travels is proof that not all utopian fiction is science fiction. It is interesting that we look back on these fantasy fictions and label them sci-fi because they are utopian or dystopian. I ask Where is the middle ground? is fantasy always so polarised?;I definitely think that dystopian fiction is science fiction. These are some of my favorite stories to read, and I have read tons of them :-) It makes me sad that most of the newer ones seem to be for teens or young adults, but I read them anyway and enjoy the amazing new worlds being created.

Where are the neuronal paths that create the attraction to these old tales? How is it that in this super fast changing world, still these tales make me pour myself a cup of tea and draw into a corner and sink in pleasure. The tales that defy every single thing I've ever been taught about causal chain, plotting, character building, narrative viewpoint. Everything. And old as they are, how is it that I cannot put the book down?  And as writers, how do we create an effect like this?;I totally agree, Anon. They do picture for us, what fear can do, what being brave can bring, and one of my favorites, Hans in Luck, the uplifting optimism. They paint the face of humanity, bare. Desires, fears, all bare, no makeup, no justification.  I marvel at them, despite the horror they sometimes depict.  Yet, I am at a loss in how to create an effect like that.   Thanks;To the Berkeley fellow I say: Oh, baloney.   The Grimms' stories have incredibly obvious biblical themes woven all through them.

Anything which enhances that process seems valid.

Most of Hollywood focuses on the action part of sci-fi rather then the wonder (Look at War of the Worlds Remake or Falling Skies).

I feel a little uncomfortable about grading someone's work when it actually might COUNT.

So if you've stuck to the 320 words limit before you paste it in then you'll still be fine.Edit: Coursera also counts hyphenated words, for example ""fair-haired"" as two separate words, I think.;Megan, as far as I can tell, anything that is separated by a space or punctuation mark of any kind counts as a separate word!

All of these people tell fairy tales, and that is just the beginning. Link, especially, tells wonderful fairy tales. Kij Johnson (who is published under Link's publishing house occasionally) is also good for this--her story ""Ponies"" is terribly dark and wonderful and very much a fairy tale. It's available for free online here, as well as part of Johnson's ""At the Mouth of the River of Bees"" which is also very good.Honestly, I think it's a matter of knowing where to look, especially if you want more traditional-styled tales. Having worked in ""literary publishing"" and gone to conventions and sat there and listened/added to the conversations, I know they're there--mostly in short story collections, books published by smaller presses (Small Beer!), and literary journals (The Fairy Tale Review pops into mind, although there are others). You just need to search a bit.;Literary journals are generally found at conventions, or purchased online through subscriptions or individual issues now-a-days. Honestly, most people I know who keep up with literary journals are people who either publish in them or people who work for one. It's very insular.Your best bet for most is independent bookstores and online, because chain bookstores generally only carry works published by the Big Six publishers, and most of these authors publish through smaller or indie presses. All of the authors I listed have actual, physical books released, although most are also available as ebooks too. Kelly Link actually releases most of her stories for free online, and I know Kij Johnson has a few free ones floating around online, too.Although all of the authors I mentioned are award-winning authors you probably aren't familiar because major publishing houses do not often publish short story collection outside of collections from people who are already majorly famous (story collections don't sell as well as novels)--and most of these authors are short story writers.That said, Jane Yolen is actually insanely famous, but mostly in the 90s. I've also never read anything by her, just been to a few lectures  and panels  she's done on fantasy and fairy tales.;Last month Indigo press released an anthology of modern stories of this genre entitled     ""Modern Grimmoire.""A clip from Goodreads--   http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17788344-modern-grimmoireTwo hundred years ago, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm--better known as The Brothers Grimm--published their collection to ensure that the various German fables, tales and folklore of their age and before would not die out.

My original training is in philology and Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm were prominent figures in philology. As such, we discussed them and their work in great detail. As mentioned in this link:http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/IE_Main5_Grimm.htmlthey collected tales from all over Europe. Some of the village storytellers they interviewed to collect their tales were interviewed about it after the tales' publication. The Grimm brothers did not simply write their tales according to everything I ever encountered in the field.Moreover, one of my German instructors was a specialist in the Grimmmaerchen. He also confirmed this impression. My copy of the tales is the Goldmann edition (isbn 3442004128), containing the original German. Its introduction also refers to the tales as collected rather than written as original work by the two Grimm brothers.Certainly the tales were edited and the multiple versions of most tales collected compared, but I have never before heard the tales epresented as simply written by the Grimms.Am I misunderstanding something?;To address a few comments above;The stories,as I have always understand, were collected specifically to test certain philological theories and originally published with only other philologists in mind. So writing their own tales would have been counter-productive. I have always understood the brothers were happily surprised when the public also took an interest.I'm not sure I get the point of the Disney comments.;Dystopic fantasies anyone?

Next to video link on the right side.;In the story ""The Cat and Mouse Partnership"" the cat and mouse represent the multiple nature of humanity.   The cat represents the predatory selfishness, deception, and opportunism that humans exhibit.   His nature is illustrated by his statement that ""Nothing tastes so good as what one keeps for one's self""while eating the fat he and the mouse had saved for winter, when no food would be available. Also by his eating the mouse at the end of the story, he further demonstrates that he possesses these traits. The mouse on the other hand represents the trusting and altruistic side of humanity.   She holds up her end of her agreement with the cat, keeping house for him and trusting all the while that the fat they are saving for winter will be shared in lean times.   The cat's eating the mouse at the end of the story, followed by the statement ""and that is the way of the world"" indicates that these aspects of human nature are incompatible because those who are too trusting are bound to get taken advantage of.   I think gender roles are also important in this story but am not quite sure how, does anyone else have an opinion on that?;Perfect..

It helps in terms of creating and building up tension in stories as well as driving a point further. I agree with what you said that the first time is a random happenstance, the second time establishes the pattern, and the third time breaks it. While I do enjoy studying symbolisms in stories, I think that in this case maybe the use of threes is just for effect. After all, these stories were written for the purpose of teaching values and children learn better when there are patterns and repetition.;Three Blind Mice we sang as children.

Since I had the correct number of words, and I had agreed to the honor code thing, I'm guessing that I HAVE TO cite sources, although I read somewhere that citing sources was not necessary if we had no sources to cite.   So.   I suppose I have to cite the Grimms?I went to the course wiki, looked at the sources listed by the previous students.   And saw that they had dates like 2007, 2008, for their Grimms.   So I'm wondering if the dates for the online version would not be the 1882 edition published by MacMillan & Co in London that is listed on the front page?   ;I could be horribly wrong, but I cited the material scanned rather then the year of scanning, so 1882 edition.

Looking up ""happy"" in a dictionary, I discovered the synonym, ""blissful"", meaning full of bliss, utter joy or contentment. These are attributes that emerge from internal as opposed to external stimuli. Hans is at peace with himself, and the world, and is therefore happy. Is this moralstic? Instructional? That's hard to say. ;Reminds me of the character Tom Hanks played in Forest Gump,  ;Hans is indeed lucky, he has inner peace and that is a wonderful thing to have. The gold means no more than the lump of rock, he does not need possessions to make him happy, how many of us would value that peace of mind in this material world.;Before I begin my post, a tad bit of info about me. I'm a college prof, computer science, but also a professional storyteller; think the oral story tradition. I registered for this course to engage in discussions of the types of writting I enjoy: tales and science fiction. I read and write and publsh SciFi. Now for the meat of my post. The Brothers Grimm did a wonderful thing by scouring the countryside for oral tales, which they then set down in written form. Or did they? How much of what they wrote is actually what they collected, transcribed, and how much is ""made up""? Let's leave that an open question, for now. Instead, allow me to discuss what happens when oral tales are transcribed. The Brothers Grimm are not the first to ever transcribe these ""folk"" tales. On the contrary, many, many individuals and groups have done so over time. The Foxfire series is a wonderful modern example of this sort of effort. But the way we speak is not the same as the way we write, yes, both are based on the same grammar rules, but that's perhaps where the similarities end. Both the act of telling a story and of writing a story demand that one knows the ""story"" first. Knowing a story, however, does not imply memorizing a story. Consider how when describing that fish you caught, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Or, better yet, consider givng directions to someone how to get from point A to point B. Depending on who we retell this story to (and, yes, giving directions is telling a story), we may add or subtract details, as well as adjust the language used to match the listener's age, etc.  Yet, the story we retell is exactly the same each time. Why? Becase we know the story, and it from what we know that we recreate the oral delivery of the story. What one tells, or writes, is an instance of the story inside her head. How do we know stories? Again, that's another, related topic, for another discussion. Moving on to written stories, each is also a story instance. But unlike oral stories, written stories generally consist of complete sentences (not fragments), and contain sufficient detail for most readers. And oral story instance, therefore, is one state of an evolving story rendition, whereas written story instances are fixed for all time. Yes, there are multiple translations of Grimm tales, but they're all based on the same source material, differing in the intent ofbthe translator(s). Nuff said! ;Given the shear number of attendees, for thus course, I will assume there must be other unuversity-level faculty participating just for the joy of learning. So, where are you? ;Here  _;Here who? ;I'm Lisa Stapp.   This fall, I will be Adjunct Instructor for an online class, ""Professional Ethics"" at Concordia University, Seward, Nebraska.I'm here for the sheer joy of learning.

When one of the students is frustrated with online learning for whatever reason, I want to be able to listen both empathetically AND with current understanding.;Okay, a start. What I'm interested to hear is how you plan to use what you learn here in your classes. Fir example, I'm working hard at wrapping up a monograph first draft on using a story paradigm in STEM education. So, story is a very popular topic with me. ;Great!

I tried another HuMOOC earlier this year on Greek heroes but the forum conversation about the meanings of individual words rapidly got away from me (!).

I just hope those peers who are reviewing essays each week are aware that not everyone in the course is well-versed in the art of literary argument writing.   Also, there are many non-native English speakers, who struggle with the nuances of English writing.Kindness and constructive criticism will go a long ways towards building a vibrant learning community.Several of the peer feedback comments I received on the Grimm Brothers assignment were incredibly helpful and encouraging, Thank you to those kind souls, as I now have a much clearer direction for future writing.   It will indeed be a steep ""learning curve"" in this course regarding a literary writing style.I must admit, however, that I  also found some of the peer feedback I received to be unkind and more about advancing that person's ego and self-appointed status as an ""expert critic"".   This was really an inappropriate use of the peer feedback component of the course.This community of learners is diverse, so let's celebrate that diversity, not discourage other learners.Constructive criticism would be deeply appreciated by those of us struggling with writing in a literary style and/or those who are writing in a non-native language.We are all interested in life-long learning and everyone of us brings unique perspectives to the course that can enrich the learning of an intelligent and attentive audience.;The moral is like that of throwing a stone into the pond, it causes ripples. One person's action can have a reaction that affects many. Every living creature is going to die but if the hen had not been greedy and untruthful, she would not have died then and caused such a chain reaction. Be honest and truthful.  ;I agree with Racheal Smithson . And for raining it is used in either happiness or sadness it depends on the situation and the way its being said. So here the sister was weeping wich mean crying and as their situation is so harsh that made even the sky cry as well . The metaphor is so effective and describes alot of feeling .;This is indicative of how much influence a translator has over the meaning of a story.   Are the Grimms fairy tales we were assigned (the one on gutenburg) changed from the orignal German to better reflect the norms and values of the english?;Kim, I agree with you that it's hard drawing that line with younger children. I'm really learning that now that I have a 2.5yo. I want to say that this should be an ongoing dialogue over the years, that gets both more general and more specific as she gets older and has more life experience and opinions of her own to bring to bear.As an example, I'm nearly finished reading her Dodie Smith's The 101 Dalmations (ie the original from 1959, not the Disney versions, neither of which she has seen. She's only just learning to hear and understand a longer story, and is mostly enjoying this as something we do together, that's about dogs! So for her now I simply skipped the section with the Gypsies, as well as the patronising of Missus for her ""female"" lack of spatial awareness. The next time we read it together, and certainly when DD can read it for herself, she will presumably be more ready for some of the discussions around those representations. At the moment those are minor skippable parts of the narrative, so I'm skipping them.;Megan, Karen, Andrea et alI haven't had the chance to do more than skim the thread over the past few days, but thank you for being thought provoking and teaching me.;Marla, I keep coming back to your post and wanting to comment on how much I think we let 'BACK THEN' off the hook too much. I'm torn though, because it's the privilege of my education (familial, formal, and self-read) that means I was pretty aware of some of these topics 20 years ago as a teenager (sexism especially, anti-Semitism definitely, other racism + homophobia theoretically, transgender issues probably not at all) and knew vast swathes of history about some of it. (In 1994 I did a school project about Christine de Pisan, a 14th century French writer who argued strongly against the denigration of women, and addressed her writings (at least in theory) to women of all classes, not just queens and nobles.)In short, I don't think we can always excuse classic writers for their bigotry, even when we still read and discuss their work for its historic value and literary merit.;I read a good many of the original versions of Grimm's and Anderson's stories when I was eight or nine, but I was also exposed to the watered-down Disney-ed versions. The differences were so striking that I could help but think of them as different stories altogether, not just different versions of the same story. There was Ariel in the Little Mermaid, and there was the mute mermaid who had to walk on sharp knives and bleed in silence all day in the original version. The violence in many of the stories greatly disturbed me, particularly the thought of Snow White's stepmother being forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes till she died. That's why I think I have never thought of fairy tales as being simply ""for kids"". The watered-down versions certainly, but not the originals. With my recent re-reading of Grimm, I think it is more illuminating to think of fairy tales as being a window into the societies and cultures that they passed through. The true value of fairy tales is historical - these were the qualities valued in men and women, these were the prevailing attitudes, these were the common professions, this was the social structure.;OK, so I was exaggerating, but just a little.   :)   And what I am finding in evaluating essays is what I felt my problem was.   Ideas were not developed enough.   Yes, a theme can be stated in a sentence, but often I think the theme needs to be explained.   It is hard for me to adequately explain my thoughts in so small a space.   Most of the essays I have read seem incomplete because the good ideas or thesis (which many lacked) are not developed.   My original essay ran about 750   words on Word, and that was as economic as I thought I could be. I was shocked to see I was way over the word limit.   So I cut and changed, and re-wrote, re-thought and got the word count down, but I fear that the connections/points I wanted to make won't be obvious, that the essay will feel jumbled.   I hope we'll get to see a good essay that is within the word count limit.   So far, I have not seen any near one and I fear my own will fall into that category too.    I am a verbose writer, I know, so maybe this class will help me to learn to be more concise, although I write creative fiction mostly, not non-fiction.   ;I like your analogy, I think, but I am Math imparred, so it goes way over my head.   :0   ;Hi Luis, wath i really asked myself was : why was the rabbit in our world?;This is  a good idea for the new book. ;Gender issues in Dracula is something that has been examined for some time - in particular the nature of the roles both genders play - when I studied the text for pre university entry, I examined the idea that the female vampires became the ultimate threat for a man - women who penetrated rather than became penetrated - but then, in turn this came from their own penetration by Dracula - analogy for syphilis and the spread of disease, but also the transfer of power and the roles that vampire and hunters have compared to the traditional roles played in the 'family' home.;""He had impure thoughts, yes.

Branding someone as;The only thing I want to add to this discussion: my understanding is that most child molesters desire youth, without being very particular about anatomical gender.If Lewis Carroll had the impure thoughts, it's curious that he claims no interest in little boys.It is a disturbing topic, but also one that I think it's important to discuss in a college-level course.;I must confess, as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, that this thread has slightly affected the way that I view the book. I had never read the book before or seen any of the films or television adaptations. So this was my first ever time of being introduced to Alice and the wonderful Wonderland. I fell in love with it. I think it's such an amazing book. I am not criticising the thread starter or anyone else by the way, because it is clearly a topic that a lot of people have discussed over the years. I was just never aware of it that's all. I just felt like I needed to say that. But also to say that I really do love this book. It was amazing to be introduced to Alice for the first time and see Wonderland through her eyes. I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this course.;What a lovely and thought provoking post. I also love Alice in Wonderland and viewing life from Alice's perspective as she tries to make sense of it all. Total classic.;paedophilia is not a sexual orientation. It is a mental illness/personality disorder. Calling it a sexual orientation legitimises it somewhat and the fact that the child has no power in any perceived relationship within paedophilia makes it a predatory act.   ;About five years ago our local library put on a display of his books and related commentaries.

How do I do that or can I now not continue on the course. I can't even find where I ask this question - feeling technologically challenged! ;Mine was evaluated 5.5, and am very happy about this grade and the sympathetic and useful comments of my peers. :-DBut one of them wrote I should have given more examples and explain them. Of course I was not able to do that due to the word limitation, since I followed it (ca 310 words). Btw, my second essay (about Alice) is already written, and has 320 words exactly.Good luck to you all.  ;So has mine!;It may be a a problem with particular browsers but the tech people should know.. It's much more difficult to write a short essay than a long one so they should be penalised in my opinion; as the person above has suggested.;Agree, the system should not accept anything over the word count. If I had such a long essay, I would just mark and read to the word count but luckily mine have all been okay so far.;I haven't received an overlong essay yet.   If I did, then it would get a 1 for form for ignoring the instructions (after checking the word count).   I wouldn't penalize it for content, though.;I have to agree with these posts, the grading is difficult. While most gave an attempt at a thesis, it was what I would consider an obvious thesis or something that we already knew. It did nothing to enrich or enlighten my thoughts on the collection as a whole or on an individual story. With that being said, this is a MOOC, while the syllabus says one thing for the type of student that should be in this course, that is not necessarily what is here. Who are we to say what is intelligent and what is not, I personally don't want to say that anyone is unintelligent, that is not my goal here. I say if there is at least an attempt at a thesis and a clear logical train of thought then hey, E for effort. If there is some work that can be done, I will be more than happy to give some polite constructive feedback. We are all here to get something different out of this class. I personally am interested to get others views on these classics and to finally get them read. Three quarters of the books on the syllabus are on my to be read list that I haven't gotten around to, and this is a good way to do it. Just my two cents on this whole grading thing that everyone is stressing over....;I find it hard to judge/evaluate essays that are clearly written by someone who for whom English is a second language.   I understand that everyone needs to use proper grammar, etc., but I found myself feeling guilty for giving low points when I realize that maybe it is not the ideas or concepts that seem flawed but the confusing way of expressing them.   ;Exactly, and this is after all a peer review. No one is going to get college credit for this course. I am interested in what others will say about my thoughts and I will take their feed back and welcome it. Give low points, don't give low points, it's really up to you as the one doing the grading. Just give your honest feedback. That is all you can really do. Some will get mad, some won't care. It all depends on why they are here.I will be honest, I am an avid reader, I read between 3 and 12 books per month, I have an above average IQ, I also have a GED because I dropped out of high school and have only completed 2 hours of college credit and those were online courses. Some would say I am not qualified to take this course per the syllabus, but I feel that I am qualified. So, here I am, like it or not.Don't get me wrong and think I am not taking this seriously, I am. I just don't expect much from other people, I am a pessimist. It will be what it will be. No point in getting your panties in a wad over it is all I am saying. ;);I think I may have been generous with my grades for this first time, but I don't think I will for the next go round.   Everyone should be learning how to write essays, and hopefully got some pointers.;Four of the essay simply didn't offer a thesis. One of them wrote why (s)he liked reading the tale (s)he chose. I didn't want to be harsh (but I guess I was :S), but I had to stress our assignment required us to propose what some patterns or aspects could suggest. I graded their contents a 1.;Professor Rabkin also sees Hans in love with his mother. Perhaps he's also projecting his personal prejudices onto the history of the Grimm brothers. Some people see what they want to see. And some people blindly follow them.;Why did Rabkin ignore all the women and children and powerless people who here killled horribly in the tales? It was an old woman who was shoved into an oven not a Jew.   Yet he is willing to dismiss this with a dated psychological fantasy.     The first victims of the Nazi killings were not Jews. They were disabled children and women and men.   Yet Rabkin seems not to express the same horror over these stories. Yes I do believe Rabkin showed prejudice.Because they do not follow Propp's rules means nothing. It does not show any malevolence or agenda of any kind. Fairy tales are adapted everywhere, the Grimms didn't do anything unusual. And even if in hindsight they seem poor folk lorists,   I didn't see any proof at all that they had any kind of agenda just a bunch of conjecture by Professor Rabkin .;You are ignoring the fact that the killing started with useless people much like the old women in Grimm not with the Jews. When people ignored that it spread on to the Jews.My point is that violence against ""useless"" old women being accepted is a more likely contribution to the Nazi mindset than any antisemiticism in Grimm. Violence against women and children and powerless people   is still happening today but people fixate on a period in history that everyone can agree is evil and so don't have to look at the world around them. Your inventing a ""backstory"" about blood libel doesn't change that.   The fear of being eaten is a primal fear that appears in a lot of cultures not just Europe.I'm disagreeing with   opinions   not denigrating the people who are making them.   ;http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/disabilities/I've been assuming you understand my reference to the killings beginning with disabled and useless. But just in case.;I never said a campaign to harass useless old women was the real horror of Germany. The article I referred you to was from the holacaust musem. Do you have some prejudice against information that doesn't come from Wiki?;I didn't say their website supports that statement. I don't know if the people at the museum would agree or not. And neither do you. You have as much value as any other human being and you have as much right to argue as any one else does. Every individual has equal value. That's what I've been saying.;I am a little dismayed at the fact that although I took thoughtful time and consideration to write not only my essay but the peer reviews as well, in return I received peer reviews which did not meet up with the minimum guidelines of at least 30 words!   In addition, I think if you are making a statement on grammar and word usage, the reviewer might take the time to also submit the review in the same manner.   Incomplete sentences or just a few words doesn't give much credit to the reviewer.   Though some of the reviews had valid points, I was just a little disappointed that it appears as though the reviews were made last minute and haphazardly.   As I am not receiving a grade for this work, the reviews are important to be able to improve my writing skills.   I feel I wasted my time submitting reviews instead of reading the next assignment.   Sorry for the rant but I feel it is important to point out.I also noticed I only had 4 peer reviews - shouldn't there be 5?   I recall making at least 5 reviews.    I actually submitted a few more as it will help me in the long run to view other points of discussion for the reading assignment.   ;That sounds like an excellent idea too, you might want to focus on one or two, however, just so you can explore it in depth.  ;I agree. It   s not about pretending that grammar isn   t an issue because it is (if you can   t understand what someone else is trying to say then how do you expect to comment on it?), but the idea is to give constructive criticism rather than simply dismissing an exercise because the person doesn   t have a lot of experience writing in English.   I   m not a native English speaker, and one of the reasons I enrolled in this class was to practice and find ways to improve myself and communicate better with others. I would hate to find people here who either completely disregard anything I have to say because it   s not phrased properly, or don   t point out my mistakes for fear of making me feel bad, because we   re all here to learn.   ;I didn't mean he was wrong. It just   he was too harsh in my opinion. I search into Hobsbawn and Burns and not at once they make the link whit german's superior race. After all, nationalism was very strong everywhere and the ""germans"" was still trying to figured out what being a german meant.  ;Alice is unsure of her identity, she cannot recite the poem correctly and it appears that being in Wonderland has affected her. The caterpillar questions who she is and she is unsure as things keep changing.;I shouldn't answer this because I am already working my essay around it, but I don't think Carroll is defying the laws of our physical universe, if you look at mathematical laws and if you look at chaos theory which in early theory was developed by mathematicians, you can say that Wonderland is really built on mathematical law.However, since my essay will be based on this due to the amount of mathematical patterns I have seen in the story, I don't want to say anymore. I already don't know how to get it down to 320 words. LOL;Suggestion to all examining this - look closely at chess and its structures - indeed, there have been writings about Carroll's usage of chess metaphor, the ideas that relate to development and the logic behind it. Hope this helps.;Very good point with good examples as well Emma - I personally feel there is no difference in Wonderland and 'this' reality - [in regards to physics anyhow] - granted we don't have the size changing and talking animals, but that is more about perception rather than actual physics... isn't it?;Thanks for the link. This is an old version..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlN8rrmOVU;Well you should be on to Alice and Through the Looking Glass by now, and yes, I'd say you should read all of both books.;The program will not accept submissions exceeding the 10% standard allowed over the word count.  ;I have evaluated many more than five essays and none has been over the word count.;Mary how many paragraphs were they? 300 words is going to be about three or four average paragraphs.Also did you get the word count from MS Word or something else? I used Word for my essay and it was very close to the Coursera word count.;I find it difficult to imagine how ONE person out of the thousands enrolled in this course, received three essays, each one from three different people, totaling exactly 1,000 words. This is truly odd, an absolute abomination - especially since the program will not allow submissions of that length!     ;Hello, I have given grades to all 5 assignements with great hesitation. I do understand that overall in such MOOC, we should end up with 10-30% of the grades regarding the form and content being 1's, and not more than 20% of the grades being 3's. I understand that this should work when grading at least 20 assignments. (Which I  know I am welcome to do). However, I have found that very challenging on my particularly small selection of 5 assignements...   I am ending up for example with a  paper without conclusion and another paper entirely retelling the story... So, my question is: does this rule apply for our particular selection?;I should think it does not apply for any particular selection of essays. We are to grade the essays based on weather they are good or not and not just compare the 5 essays we are given.Having said that, I did find it helpful to assess more then 5 essays, as it did give me a chance to run into more quality essays and made me more confident in grading them.;I think I understand what you are saying. The percentages do not work out in the five essays I received either. Three of mine I'd like to give ones on everything to, and the other two are only satisfactory. None of them wowed me or even were up to snuff in my opinion. So, yeah, I just graded the fairest way I knew how and didn't worry about the percentages.;We are to review 5 essays. 6 and over is optional, but 5 is obligatory. ;I was happy with my evaluation. It was really nice to read the positive comments and I also appreciate the comments explaining to me where I could improve. I agreed with the suggestions offered  to me. One of my peers wrote the absolute bare minimum (about 5 words for each) which was frustrating because I couldn't really take much from what they said, but it could be that they simply didn't have the time to evaluate more than that. Overall, I feel happy with my results :);Same here. Nice comments, I agree where I made mistakes, but I had one person being negative without motive and in just one sentence. ""Everyone knows fairy tales do this"" isn't good feedback. And if you think about it, most of us know the themes that appear in the stories, so what, now we can't talk about them?;I got something along the lines of: really? that's your argument? if that's why the stories are great then all stories are great. I understand if people don't agree or are not convinced with the points I'm making, but there's no need for sarcasm as I am only learning and don't have all the answers.;I thought some of it was too subjective. I got marked down by someone and their comment was ""that's not what I would have focused on.""   I also think that the assignment details stating most should be graded as a 2 influenced graders to grant people a score of 2. ;Two of my reviewers were complimentary enough to make my day and the other 2 were lukewarm and complained about things that weren't required like not including more than one story in the 320 word analysis.  You just never know. It's kind of hard to write for such a diverse unknown audience. ;I don't know if I read your essay, but I did mention to one writer that I wish they had given examples from other stories, because it seemed like the assignment was to go over themes that were present in the whole book that we read. I didn't mark the essay down for it, it was just something that I thought would have made their essay even better which is what the reviewer is supposed to comment on. ;I had high hopes for the peer reviews since everyone's been saying how great and wonderful they are and unfortunately, I have been greatly disappointed. Two of my reviewers wrote only in the form and content sections with a few words each and that's all. Another reviewer just explained how he/she disagreed with me, but never talked about how I could improve my own essay's form or content. I only had four reviewers as well. How is it justified that some people are having five graders and others have less? My overall grade was high, but "

It takes a lot   of work.   I do try to be thorough and give good, useful comments.   But since I have been mostly rather disappointed in the essays, I wanted to read more, see if I could find a really good essay.   I discovered I could not read more without evaluating them, so I gave each of the optional ones what I felt was my honest assessment by numbers, but I made no comments.   I read until I found one I felt comfortable giving a 6, which was quite gratifying.  ;So could you possibly get evaluations from more than 4 people?    So far I've only gotten 4 each time.   So I am thinking not, that you only get comments/grading from among the original reviewers assigned to you.   Will all evaluations be seen by the author?   If you evaluate the ones you are assigned, the optional ones you do will or won't be seen by the authors? If the author does not see them, them comments don't matter.;Thanks for this information.   In the future, I'll not review if I don't have time to comment.   ;OK, I understand.   But I just don't have the time to do as thorough a job of reviewing more than I am assigned.   So I guess that means I shouldn't read more.;I think it is helpful to read all the essays you are given to review FIRST, before grading any of them.   It helps you get in the mood, get ready to focus better, I think.   Also, wine helps tremendously.  ;I was joking about the wine.   Is there an online wine tasting course?   That could be fun.   ;I think it's almost as hard to come up with comments as it is to write the essays.   I want to be helpful, but I'm not a teacher!   If I think it sounds like they're making up BS as they go along, should I call them on it?  ;I agree Florencia, the same thing happened to me. Last time I was marked down for spelling errors, so I proofread my paper a dozen or so times, and yet I was still given a 2 for form. The only negative feedback I received was that there were a few ""editing mistakes"" - which were not clarified, and after having 3 co-workers read it, we still never found any. Then, another person said I needed fewer paragraphs. Granted, I did have   5 paragraphs, but each one was the shift in a new idea or point, which is when you are supposed to write a new paragraph. I am confused on how this made my grade a 2 when the other 2 graders said my paper ""flowed beautifully"" and was well written and structured.I had an open mind last time and accepted what the reviewers said, but this time I feel my paper was better written and had really good feedback. I am super frustrated!!  ;Thanks Paul,     That actually does make me feel a little better. I think I am just holding myself to too high of a standard as I have an English degree and taught English for a number or years. Granted it has been a while, since I was in school. I just think some reviewers are being extremely nit-picky and looking for reasons to mark people down.   ;I find some of the essays so poorly written or thought out that giving a 1 seems like high praise.   In the future, perhaps there should be a 0 grade possible as there were in other Coursera classes I have taken.   Just a suggestion.   ;It was just a suggestion.   I have given 1s (and detailed comments ) to people I thought were trying and also to those who obviously didn't take the assignment seriously.   I felt bad for those who I thought were trying, but didn't quite come up to par (2), but for those who wasted my time, I would have liked the option to not give them any points.   If people knew that they could get a 0, perhaps the one sentence, non-sense works or writings that didn't in any way have anything to do with the assignment would stop. In the other classes I've taken where an essay and evaluations were required, there was always a 0 grade option.   In one there was also a criteria for citations, in addition to form and content.   One had to grade whether the citations were proper.   Actually, If it were me, I would like more options, from 0 to 5, which would then correspond with grading most understand.   0 = poor, 1 = tried, but not quite, 2 = adequate, 3 = above average and 4 = excellent.   Nobody would have to give a 0, but I think the option might be useful, would allow the reviewer more choices and give the authors a more accurate assessment of what the reviewer thought of their work.   And again, this is just a suggestion.   I respect your view;   we don't have to agree.         ;Okay, so the way we should look at the reviews is.....all of us are probably equally nervous about reviewing wrong, just as we're afraid of our essays not being quite right.   Or we are are absolutely adamant about the reviews we gave, as well as the perfection of the essays we wrote.   Or something like that.   Yeah, I think I waste too much time reading the forums, it just makes me stressed out.  ;One fact is Carroll's family never wanted to discuss his - probable - tendency for, or to, little girls. We can't forget Carroll was very fond of photography... ;-)  ;Oh, one of the leading  portrait photographers... Really?

No. Was it an hobby or a pastime? Yes. One of the best photographers or not, he was an amateur, not a pro, ie he didn't make  a living from it; he was very fond of photography, because he spent money on his hobby or pastime.

Hi!;Whilst not individually calculable, multiply each section by 5 to gain the total mark - this will then tell you the potential combination of marks.an average of 1 or 3 will tell you that you got 1s or 3s from every person, regardless of number of reviewers.If you have had 5 reviewers, then  between these figures tells you that the figures vary:1.2- a total of   6: 1,1,1,1,2*1.4-  a total of   7: 1,1,1,2,2 or 1,1,1,1,3  1.6-  a total of   8: 1,1,2,2,2* or 1,1,1,2,31.8-  a total of   9: 1,1,1,3,3 or 1,1,2,2,32 - a total of 10: all 2s*, or  1,1,2,3,3 or 1,2,2,2,32.2 - a total of 11: 2,2,2,2,3* or 1,2,2,3,3 or 1,1,3,3,32.4 - total of 12: 3,3,3,2,1 or, 2,2,2,3,3*2.6 - total of 13: 3,3,3,3,1 or 2,2,3,3,3*2.8 - total of 14: 3,3,3,3,2*The grades that have been put in italics are less likely as they show more variation and range- however, as has been discussed, this is not improbable due to the amount of different reviewers. Starred ones are most likely as they have least range, but again, not necessarily the case. However, a consistent student should find their grades slowly improving.Apologies if this was obvious to people, I thought it may help as a quick mental note to assist in quickly working out potential grades - hope it helps someone.;I was one who wanted to see what a 6 essay looked like too and now I'm really stoked since I actually got a 6 this time.   Woo Hoo!   OK,   I know it really doesn't mean anything, but it was a lovely surprise.   Thanks all who gave me such praise.             I do believe,    said Alice at last,    that they live in the  same  house!      She was referring   to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, but in both  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass, the idea of interconnectivity is prominent.   Throughout both books, dreams and reality contain similar objects.   The outside world can suddenly be inside, and the non-sensical can have its logic.   By expanding, shrinking, compartmentalizing and/or blending ideas, Carroll illustrates that all perspectives emanate from the same place, and that source is the human imagination where all things - games, animals, plants, minerals and/or people - meld and share a common language.  Language, an expression of human imagination, is the glue that often connects and transmits ideas and imaginings outwardly.   But there are  places in the mind where language is silenced or has    no names,    such as the forest on the way to where Tweedledum and Tweedledee  live, that stay inside.   Through the use of puns, repetitions, made up words, syntax reversals and all sorts of language play, Carroll shows the human imagination can be playful and whimsical, or scary and full of sorrow.   He shows both associative and dissociative tangents.     Dialogue is positioned as a kind of outside language, one heard and responded to by others, a way to interact and engage, but thoughts are given equal weight, forming a kind of inside or secret language (a talking to oneself), which is often in direct opposition to what is spoken aloud.   All of the ways language functions in the stories seem to illustrate the varying (and often oppositional) perspectives possible and they all come from the same source.               Carroll shows that any perspective is possible, that human imagination can create, bend, destroy, or blend.   His tales create impossible worlds, which can push the human mind to new ways of thinking about the world, what reality is or can be, and  all ideas    live in the  same  house."";Intense abstract post modernism????  ;Thanks for your honest critique.   You comments show that a score is dependent on what peers evaluate your work.   I thought my first essay was much better than this and only got a 4.

Critiques are subjective and not all will agree about what is an appropriate marking..;To the other Anon - your note/critique/message above, ""Intense abstract post modernism????,"" is quite cryptic.

If you want a response, please state more clearly your concern or question, and explain what   ""abstract post modernism"" is.      ;Loved this!   Thanks for sharing!   Excellent essay.   I had previously thought about the identity question, but couldn't get a clear enough idea for an essay.   You hit it exactly on the head, I think, especially in the last paragraph with your ideas about what Carroll was asking.;I loved the oxymoron you used, ""playfully serious.""     I enjoyed reading your essay and thesis (I think you are saying that Carroll understood that true education needs both logic and creativity - correct?), but I was confused because I do not understand many of your terms or connections.   For example, what did   ""Ken Robinson's Ted Talk on How School is Killing Creativity?""   argue and how does his argument or theme relate to what you are saying about Carroll's theme in the book?   Since I do not know this talk, I can't understand how it relates to your work. And what is ""The Victorian education system?""   A brief explanation on this concept would have helped me.   Likewise, I would have liked more understanding of what you mean by the term ""lessons""   you state Carroll referred to.   What were the lessons the book gave about politics, mathematics and history?   I For me, your essay would have been more powerful had you been clearer about the concepts and included more direct connections between them.  ;anonymous:  http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/schoolday.html  - this should help explain the Victorian Education system;I got a 5.5 on my first essay.

Yes, the book had an  imaginative premise and strong  central theme but both were almost entirely lost in Mary Shelley's over-wrought and over-written style. Yes, I know it was the Victorian period, but many of the initial reviews of her book even at that time were highly critical. Dracula, as written by Bram Stoker, does not suffer from the same faults and stands the test of time much more gracefully. This book was a chore to slog through. I'll take the Boris Karloff version any day!;This is just an opinion, but Mary Shelley, at eighteen years old, probably already understood more psychology and was a better writer than Stoker coming along seventy years later.     The grand bore of the men of Dracula prefigure the sort of self congratulatory fools that one can find at shooting range with an open bar.     If only the count had been a lttle less well mannered I would have rooted for him.     See....look at what that dreadful Stoker novel did to me.     I sound like one of those guys who talks back to their TV and expects an answer.;I've received high scores in my two essays, but I have advanced degrees which required a great deal of writing. The fact that you have such a small word count means that you need to develop your essay in a concise manner. Here are some ideas:--Learn your grammar rules, especially how to use COMMAS, and the use of singular and plural pronouns (try this: Choosing between singular and plural pronouns for dummies)--Have at least three paragraphs with an introduction, supporting arguments/quotations and a conclusion. You don't need a title, which I saw in a couple of essays. Your thesis should be clearly stated in the first couple of sentences and repeated in a similar form, after you have supported it, in your conclusion. Do not go off on tangents. I have seen this several times, where the essay starts off well and then the rest of the essay has nothing to do with the original thesis. Don't try to cover too many different ideas in an essay of this size, pick one topic and develop it.--Re-read your work OUT LOUD. You will discover that some words are missing or misspelled (saw this is several essays.)--Rewrite several times. I create a draft with my main ideas and in the next couple of days I will add quotes and delete others, tightening the concept as I go.--Remember your audience. These are your peers grading your paper and they might enjoy humor or a personal aside. I loved the comment someone left me that turned my entire thesis on its head and really made me think. That person gave me a high grade for my rationale, but I loved that they had a totally different take on the topic!--Avoid using words that you commonly use in conversation and should be avoided at all costs in critical essays. For example: ""so"" (oy vey, this is SO overused), ""like"" (as in, visualize a Valley Girl speaking), ""you know"", etc.I've had three kids in college (one currently in medical school, one in grad school and one who is a junior) and they were, without a doubt, terrible writers as freshmen. By their senior year, their writing had developed nicely and all three agree that creating a draft and rewriting are the keys to an ""A"" paper. My daughter published a biology research paper in college and that required an entirely different style of writing which was directed at a totally different audience (I could barely understand the abstract.) A few people are naturally talented writers, but for most of us it  requires effort and practice. My brother-in-law is a successful mystery  novelist and you should see how many re-writes his editor has him do  before the novel is ready to go to print. Writing styles vary depending on the topic. Literary criticism is different from technical writing (have you read a Microsoft Word manual lately?), just as a bill in Congress is written differently from the speech that the President (or his speech writer) wrote for the State of the Union. These were all written for a different audience and purpose.It is unfortunate that students in this course can't get direct feedback from the professor because that is how my children learned to write in college, but hopefully some of the reviews will give useful feedback. I do spend time on my reviews, but others may not have the luxury of that available time.;Thank you.  This is great info.  Thanks for sharing. ;In case an example might help, my essay received a 3 for form (which I don't think it deserved) and a 2 for content:  On the surface,  Alice In Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  are playful tales for children:   Alice enters two dream worlds and encounters fantastic characters and events there.   It may seem all in good fun, but the absurdity and fearful situations Alice encounters can be considered metaphors for the existential horror of everyday life.   Consider, for example, the imagery of transformation from animal to human, animate to inanimate, and vice versa, and how in the novels eating is symbolic of the destructiveness inherent in everyday life.For example, cards and chess pieces assume human qualities, then revert back to their inanimate forms, Alice shakes the Red Queen into a kitten, when Alice's neck grows to an absurd length the Pigeon questions whether she is a serpent or a human, and the Duchess' baby morphs into a piglet.   The boundaries among animal, human, and inanimate are flexible and fluid.   Although these transformations are playful, even magical, the constantly shifting categories create an element of existential uncertainty and dread.   When the rules of logic no longer apply, the unpredictability leaves the reader anticipating the next transformation and how the story will unfold, but there is also a sense that, from Alice's perspective the entire scenario could change into something horrific.   To survive in this constantly shifting world, one must master the Mock Turtle's curriculum of ""ambition, distraction, uglification.""   The shifts invite the reader to consider the perspective of characters other than protagonist Alice, including those who become food. The Lobster Quadrille and the Walrus and the Carpenter who danced with, then ate, ""every one"" of the unfortunate lobsters, are emblematic of the constant betrayals lurking below the surface niceties of everyday life.   Beneath the surface, our world, and relationships, are as broken, and as irreparable, as is Humpty Dumpty.   Beneath the surface, the novels are dark fables.   ;How did Harker get away?   Where is it described?;Thanks.   After I finished the book, I was looking for the description.   I think it is a major omission.   The detailed description of h is imprisonment, and plans for escape, the leading up to it, then nothing about how he got from the castle to being nursed by the good sisters.   You would think he would at least have had a conversation with Mina about it.;I was a bit disappointed with the Count, he didn't fight for his live! Moreover, he decided to run away, back to Transylvania!;He who turns and runs away, lives to fight another day.;I found the novel a bit of a bore, and I have a very high tolerance for boredom.     Imagine some hack filtering his world view through the cheap psychology of Dr. Phil while he writes a novel on his TV tray.     That is the Victorian era equivalent we find in Stoker.     No deep insights, bad pacing, very repressed characters (hard to believe he was a fan of Walt Whitman).       Van Helsing should have read more Kierkegard.     I would have found him more believable plowing 40 acres in   Minnesota than playing Socrates to three uptight British gentlemen and an American who fetishises Winchesters.       ;I just...

It is not only on a language level.           I am not sure if schools in every country planting the same structure of written work to the students heads. As a result we have different expectations, and from there we receiving conflicts , misunderstanding and resentmen. That is why this forum and your comments are so important. I really appreciate your help. ;Precious information. Are we have here more teachers from around the world to explain to us exact rules of the academic writing (traditional in their countries )? It will be very helpful ( especially for the grading and establishing more  understanding between fellow classmates). I believe misunderstanding can backfire in both ways. Students, who have a solid knowledge in US writing standards can mark down the work of the people who do not have such a knowledge . In other hand, classmates, who have different values and academic experience , according to this values and experience, can mark down the work of US students . Classic cultural confrontation , as Romans and Barbarians: should you wear pants or you should not? ;This combination of motive sometimes turns into real fights over which country owns  the first version of the folk tale. For Russians Afanasiev's compilation overshadows Grimm's tales.  ;Some great observations here--I teach on the university level (I'm teaching a World Lit class right now and we'll be watching Spirited Away and discussing its influences in a week or two) and I can tell you that at least one Japanese scholar, Ando Satoshi, wrote a journal  article on the connection between Spirited Away and Alice's Adventures  in Wonderland.I also noticed the similarities to the Russian and Slavic Baba Yaga. While researching Spirited Away's roots in Japanese folklore, I found out that there is a Japanese mountain withc/deity who corresponds very closely to the EAstern European Baba Yaga. If you are interested in learning more about Spirited Away and Japanese folklore and mythology, and if you can get access to academic databases, you can check out an article by Thomas Keirstead which will tell you more.;Anyone who's watched the professor's lecture on color symbolism would know that orange is usually meant to represent childhood. This is why the first Disney theme parks were built in Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida--two traditional sources of oranges. The fact that the marmalade jar was empty foreshadows the loss of innocence accompanied by Alice's maturity. Note her reluctance to part with the jar, even as she clung to the remaining vestiges of a child's experiences. She has already consumed the orange marmalade, unknowingly, through her childhood experiences up to that point. Putting the jar back into a cupboard marks a suspension of her ordinary experience during a journey into adulthood.;but is it marmalade?;Over interpretation is really exist when it  is totally out of the context and comon sence and taken out of the thin air. And unlike the bright idea it is often dull repetition of the popular theme of the day.(for exemple : sexuality everywhere , including "" Alice in Wonderland ""). ;I'll agree with every point you have just made, adding only that children of all ages, once aware of the world and a mis-deed [e.g. they are aware of what right and wrong is on a simple level] can start picking up the 'darker' threads. Peter Pan is very dark, but it is when these stories are made into mainstream quick-media [Disney films, pantomimes, comics* simplified version stories - this is the bad guy - say boo etc, ] that the darkness is transferred into lighter comedy horror - the step-mother is still terrifying but she is obviously the evil character now.*Comics in the sense of a few pages of quick story rather than the actual medium of graphic literature which can be as complex, if not more so, than novella.;Sean - thank you for clarifying the point - I, like anonymous had an issue with this but fully agree with your point.;Yes, thank you, Sean, you expalined that beautifully, especially the part about how your brain is tricked by the illusion the mirror creates. That helps a lot. I think we mean the same thing, the image you see on the back of the paper is the image on the front of the paper if you invert it on the lateral axis, like a mirror does, which again is in the way the image is handled, of course.Mirrors are confusing and I still find them a little creepy sometimes. Maybe my next essay will be about them. Also, since this is a literary forum, can I recommend a short story this reminds me of? It's  'Midnight in the Mirror World', by Fritz Leiber. That spooked the life out of me.;Sean, I suggest you think again about mirrors. Do the following experiment: take a pair of gloves and go stand in front of a mirror; look at the image of your left hand and try to fit one of the gloves to it. You will find that only the right glove fits the image of your left hand. Hence the image of your left hand is indeed a right hand. Mirror image. Note, however, that your thumb stays on the same side with respect to, say, your little finger. That takes care of your faulty argument about direction indicators not being reversed when seen in a rear-view mirror. Finally, ask yourself why in many countries 'Police' or 'Ambulance' is written backwards on the hoods of the corresponding vehicles.;I expect Lewis Carrol would very much enjoy this and would be incredibly proud of causing all the confusion. Do mirrors reverse things? Don't they?   What does it mean if they do, what if they don't? I think the reason he liked the looking glass enough to put it the book is exactly because it messes with people's minds and makes them doubt their logic and reality, not because mirrors reverse, or they don't. This is probably more in the spirit of the books than any kind of analysis really.  ;Sean, why deny the evidence? Chirality comes up all the time in the sciences. In chemistry, mirror image molecules are identical in mass, composition, etc yet one can separate the left- from the right-handed molecules and they often have different reactivities, toxicity, etc. Sean himself is largely made of chiral molecules, as we all are. Try a diet of d-aminoacids and soon there won't be a Sean to deny chirality. You claim your gloves are symmetrical? What an incredibly lame excuse for not doing the simple experiment that would force you to reconsider! I imagine you own a pair of shoes. Pick it up and do as suggested above: you will find that your right shoe fits the image of your left foot. And don't tell me you can't do the experiment because you don't have a full-size mirror... By the way, all this has been worked out a long time ago by the branch of maths called topology. Look it up, focusing on the differences between symmetry with respect to a point and symmetry with respect to a plane. ;Sean, let's not talk about being offensive: this is after all an academic debate and, as such, it should be fierce and merciless. That's because the ante is so small. Therefore, I must take exception with your statement that 'chirality.... does not have anything to do with mirrors'. Chirality results when two of the substituents on an asymmetric carbon atom are switched around, A taking B's place and vice versa, so that the l- and d-isomers are mirror images. Obviously, it is not because they are mirror images that their properties differ; but it is because the two substituents are switched around that they are mirror images. Moreover, much as I love Prof. Rabkin's lectures, I object when he says that Martin Gardner errs when discussing mirrors in his AnAl. Gardner was a mathematician and knew his topology. Gardner was also very critical of the lazy passe-partout literary psycho-babble that sees obvious sexual symbolism in anything elongated (a pencil) or shaded (a grove) or moist (moss on a river bank)... That sort of analysis was perhaps novel and amusing in the 1920's but today it's become the absolute clich  .;Let's see if we can find what we agree on.Alice is standing in front of a mirror. Kitty is to her right. In the mirror, we see MirrorAlice and MirrorKitty. MirrorKitty seems to be to the left of MirrorAlice because the image is flipped. But MirrorKitty is still to the right of actual Alice. So maybe the actual question is, what do you consider 'reverse' to be.Anyway, the reason I started this thread is because Professor Rabkin made no sense to me when he talked about the mirror part, and the left and right part, and I don't mean the good Lewis-Carroll-no-sense way. The both of you are making a lot more sense even with the conversation a little heated.;Ive read through two different essays that are arguing that there is no point to Alice in Wonderland - no deeper meaning, no symbolism, no allegory, no parody - that it is just pure nonsense for the sake of nonsense. Im honestly not sure how to grade them in the content portion. The essays didn't really convince me at all, but I don't want to mark them down just because I don't agree. Im looking for opinions here to see how others would mark them. ;They aren't badly written, but all they made me think of were counterexamples. I think Im struggling with the fact that it is widely agreed that Alice is full of symbolism and social commentary. The essays have similar arguments against that, but they don't make sense.

For Walton it's how much he longs to conquer the north (yes, we get that, too), how much he loves Victor and so on. For the monster it is how much he wants to belong somewhere, how he wants to get back at Victor and so on. For Victor, it is mostly how desperate he is. Which is indeed a bit pathetic but if we didn't have to hear about it that much maybe it wouldn't be as bad.;I remember making a note of that.

I recently graded an essay in which I could not distinguish a clear argument, the author seemed to talk more about  a poem than the novel, and his/her entire second paragraph seemed to only retell the first few chapters of the novel with only four sentences in the entire  paragraph that  relevant to I supposed to be his/her argument. However, the third paragraph was very well written, and it connected the poem he/she was talking about to the novel, albeit in a completely different way. I ended up giving this person a 1 for content. What I want to know is was that the right grade to give, would a 2 have been better?  ;Oh.;I got a 2 for form and 2 for content but the grade they showed was 4.   So reading the work expectations caused me a bit of confusion  ;I imagine being pro-GM foods in this Frankenstein week might be pretty taboo? ;Out on a limb with Crash?

What I will say is what it did for the genre of science-fiction. Purportedly, it created it. Electricity could make a corpse move after death.

Please elaborate.;Interesing theory.   She didn't kill them, though, and she was a victim herself, part of the undead, so I see Dracula himself as the main culprit.   Perhaps only women could use children as victims.   Or perhaps she was giving birth to children the only way possible for her.   Had she lived, her victims would have become like her, so her legacy would continue.   Why only the women vampires interested in children victims?   Why not Dracula?;I did notice that, thought it was a typo or printing error.;I don't understand your point here.   What runaway wolf?   Was there a zoo in the story?   I don't recall one.

Both voldemort and Dracula are concerned with dominion, too,  and like Dracula,  Voldemort is all about breaking into places. ;You should have written ""deceased"" meaning dead, not ""diseased"" meaning suffering from a malady.

In John Seward's journals, Stoker writes about Renfield, a mentally ill patient who eats living things with the belief that he will absorb their lives. Seward writes that Renfield  ""gave many flies to one spider, and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps?""  This is in reference to the Darwinian ideas surrounding the survival of the fittest. It is suggested that Renfield might consume the cat, but Seward's curiosity encourages the reader to question the belief that humans are the apex predators of the food chain. If Renfield eats the cat, would another species in the future evolve to eat the human?  Renfield's behaviour is animalistic in nature and runs parallel to Dracula, who behaves in a similar way to achieve sustenance. He consumes living things to survive, the only difference being that he drains the blood from humans. Significantly, when Mina first sees Dracula, she struggles to decipher whether he is  ""man or beast"". Stoker intentionally portrays similar behaviour between the characters in order to imply that they are not that different. This reminds the reader of Darwin's suggestion that humans evolved from Apes.  Stoker later shows Renfield having an attack of conscience as he tries to help save Mina. This contrasts with Dracula   s behaviour as Dracula feels no remorse for his actions. This key difference between the two characters is ultimately what separates man from ""beast"". It poses questions for how the human mind may evolve in the future to account for this possible weakness, suggesting that the idea of humans evolving in to ""beasts"" is plausible. Exactly how different are we from the supernatural monsters so frequently portrayed in literature?Form:peer 1      Interesting paper - I enjoyed reading it. It was well written. Have you thought whether there are any examples in the book that contradict your theory? The thesis that Stoker was influenced by Darwin may be weak - we didn't necessarily gain any insight into how Dracula was created to understand whether he was an evolved human and Renfield's ""evolution"" within the asylum doesn't pay off in the sense he doesn't change completely (not that one would, as it would take generations per Darwin). Also, man, as unevolved, conquers vampire, as evolved, which is directly contrary to Darwin (other than there is a process...).peer 2      Excellent form. Ideas were portrayed clearlypeer 3      Clear, simple structure with ideas flowing logically.

Also, if Darwin was the underlying theme, is the conclusion of the novel that religion, or Christianity, conquers evolution?peer 2      Good parallels and illustrations to strengthen your argumentpeer 3      Interesting ideas with relevant supporting examples. I would have liked this essay to have a longer word limit and so you could develop this topic further!peer 4      This essay is brilliant! I loved the comparison between Renfield and Dracula and I loved the parallel with evolution. I also love the fact that you wrote something about Renfield. We tend to forget him! Very different and insightful!peer 5      While I think your thesis statement is interesting, and one I haven't thought of before in regards to Dracula, I, personally, see several issues with it, specifically in your information. Survival of the fittest is not about the food chain. It means that certain individuals of a specific species are more adapted to a specific environment and thus able to survive while others do not. These survivors breed and pass on those traits to their offspring, strengthening the species for that environment. It's about adaptability, not animals of different species consuming each other as predator and prey. Also, a common misconception is that Darwin claimed humans descended from modern apes. Not true. Claimed apes and humans had a common ape-like ancestor. Like I said, interesting theory, but if you're going to use that argument, should probably do some reading up on Darwin and evolution first. Just my opinion. :)I really appreciated the comments for my essay. I also agree that there are issues with my thesis. If I didn't have a word limit, I would have explored further to include counter arguments etc. I guess I was guilty of trying to find specific things to say (and quotes from the text) in attempts to support my thesis, knowing that I only had up to 320 words. I'd like to write a longer essay on this one I think! Thank you for your comments, you've given me things to think about!;I'm actually really pissed off that I didn't receive a 5 for my essay. I received the lowest mark I've ever had so far. I don't understand how I didn't score a 3 for the form section. ""Use commas when required""...? My essay is rife with commas.Johnathan Harker: A Journey to Manhood The first glimpse of Johnathan Harker shows him as a young man who  has    recently grown into manhood    under the service of Peter Hawkins. It  is evident that he has not yet fully acknowledged this transformation  as he accidentally refers to himself as a solicitor   s clerk. It is  possible that he may not be comfortable in his role as a    full-blown  solicitor    as he feels he needs to grow more in terms of his  experiences. In 19th century London, he has yet to marry and establish himself within his company in order to complete his journey to manhood. Despite being capable of exercising his skills concerning legal  matters, he still portrays the na  vet   and disobedience of a young boy.  This is evident when he ignores the warnings of the locals and also when  he feels a twisted enjoyment when going against the Count   s wishes of  sleeping somewhere other than his designated room. During his time at the castle, he is engaged to Mina. Considering the 19th  century setting it can be assumed that they intend to consummate their  relationship in their marital bed. Mina herself comments in one of her  letters that marriage signifies settling down    soberly into old married [women]   ,  thus acknowledging it as a step to adulthood. Johnathan   s ordeal and  recovery in hospital, his sudden marriage and the death of his dear  friend Peter Hawkins force him into maturity on an emotional and  intellectual level. In addition to this, he feels like a    new man    when  Van Helsing confirms what he experienced to be true. Johnathan transforms from a man who takes directions from others to a  man who takes control of situations and joins the coalition against the  Count. Ancient hunters and young warriors were considered men upon  completion of their first kill. Johnathan shears the Count   s throat,  thus completing his journey to manhood.Grade: 4FORMpeer 1      Very good structure and grammar usage, with slight errors at certain  instances (The first glimpse).

Sorry I don't have any real input for improvement.peer 5     This is  satisfactory analysis of the student's chosen topic. ;Essay: Vampires have the power to change you into one of them, and when     that happens, you lose who you are and become something monstrous. Another     way to lose your sense of self is by going mad. A homicidal maniac is another     type of monster. The affliction of madness comes up a few different times     in Dracula, and shows us the dangers of being a fanatic. Jonathan's temporary insanity is caused by fear. He is afraid that what     he saw could not have happened. He is afraid that he does not understand     how the world works after all. His fear goes deeper though, into the Problem     of Evil. How can a devout man reconcile the presence of such evil creatures     as those he saw, and at the same time believe in a God who would never     allow such a creature to exist? He cannot wrap his mind around the question     because he cannot let go of either belief. It is that which makes him go     mad. The mental patient Renfield has clearly been bitten. He eats increasingly     larger animals to sustain himself because he cannot bring himself to bite     a human. His crisis is one of spirituality as well. He cannot bite a human     victim for fear of mortal soul, but cannot release the vampire's hold on     him either. Renfield prays to Dracula,""I am here to do your bidding, Master...     and you will not pass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distribution     of good things?""(112). Here, he is asking for the assurance of immortality     that in his mind will save his soul since he feels he is lost to God. In both cases, the allusions to Christianity and fanaticism are present.     Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.     It is a lesson that would have been scandalous in Victorian Europe, which     is why it is hidden in symbolism rather than overt. Form: peer 1     You have raised different line of thought at the same time,     although you try to centralize on madness but unfortunately you couldn   t     powerfully reinforced this. peer 2     Good vocabulary and grammar. You should     think carefully about the purpose of each word and sentence and verify     if they are connected to the rest of the essay. in the last paragraph you     say: ""Stoker uses madness to caution against being too ridgid in your beliefs.""     but you didnt explore the issue of ""rigid belifs"" previously. peer 3         The structure is not fully clear to me. This e.g. concerns the reference     to christianity. peer 4     The student makes good use of grammar, punctuation     and references to the text. Although be careful of your spelling (""ridgid""     when it should be rigid). peer 5     Fairly strong essay in grammar and structure.Content: peer 1     Following your line of argument, you have deep understanding     of the work and your line of argument is valid but you couldn   t just deliver     it persuasively peer 2     I enjoyed that you brought up the issue of madness,     its an amazing topic.But I had difficulty to compare/contrast the madness     of Johnathan and the mental patient Renfield. peer 3     Interesting idea.     During the text you develop the link of various aspects in a nice way.     Maybe the Essay could be improved if you further lmit it to one element.     peer 4     Relating madness to one's beliefs makes for an interesting thesis.     Well done. peer 5     Point made about Jonathan's temporary insanity being     tied to his inability to rationalize how God would allow such evil to exist     is rather juvenile.;So far nobody could tell I am not a native... I'm proud of it.;I take it all with a grain of salt.    How many folks here are in the habit of grading other people's work?    You've had it done TOO you all through school - maybe for a couple of decades in the case of some people, and here is your opportunity to play instructor.    To a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail.    Quite honestly, 320 worlds is TOO few for me accomplish anything on any topic. I don't have the hang of it yet.    I keep thinking as I hit the submit button that I wish THEY could see a 2000 word essay by me, that then I would show them what I can do.    I've got solid 4's all down the line since the course has started.    It matters little to me because that is probably what I deserve.    During the day, like right now, I'm supposed to be writing reviews that impact what my associates are actually earning for their living.      The rubric I have to use includes negative things that they have to improve on.    I feel like a heel sometimes, but everybody has something to improve on.;Another perspective:I see the peer review as a way of learning more by reading other people's work and evaluating it.   I don't necessarily expect to learn from other people's comments on my work.   If I happen to get an interesting comment from a particularly good grader, that's just an added bonus.-anitra;I have also been really disappointed with the peer reviews. Perhaps I was looking forward to them too much. I do think that some things can be learned from them, but I am beginning to change my mind about the students giving marks. For one thing, there has been a ton of discussion about HOW to give marks, and how to give the correct percentages, and not being able to mark a 0 even if an essay is plagiarized or has nothing to do with the topic.....I mean, no offense to the Professor, but I have seen a lot more effective systems in other MOOCs. There is way too much confusion and negativeness surrounding the numbers.;I actually think it is really disrespectful for you to complain about only getting a 4 or a 4.5. This course is meant to be fun and if you are getting a 4, you performing as expected.;Peers getting more and more bitter? There's a lot of enmity toward the peer responses in the class.

I was trying to inject some levity with my post. And if you read Game of Thrones, you learn that weakness is not simply physical, mental, or economic prowess, sometimes it boils down to those who have a high opinion of themselves and are downright cruel. And at least to an American like me, it's always about competition. We see five different examples of writing. If you use that as your spectrum of skill, that makes the grading competitive. Let's all use some of George R. R. Martin's wise words to guide us as we finish up this class: ""You know nothing, Jon Snow [or insert your name]."" ;I have a problem, I am not a native speaker. Some peers have told me that my essays are a little confusing. I am not totally mad at them, not so far. For me this is a challenge to improve my english. I know I won't get a good grade at the end of the course but I don't care. Nobody is perfect. I'll keep trying over and over again.This is my beast. I must tame it!All the best for everyone.Have a great day/afternoon/evening/night.;I can relate, and I understand how you feel because the phrase this person chose to use was inappropriate, to say the least. Also, although the verb tenses agree, the sentence structure is grammatically incorrect apart from the word usage you pointed out. I would hazard a guess too, that the phrase this reviewer used was something he or she picked up somewhere, and thought it made him or her sound academically literate. Of course, it only serves the opposite purpose when one is not even proficient writing simple sentences. I can't comment on the terseness and simplicity suggestion because I haven't read your essay; but if it makes you feel any better, I once applied terminology by using the expression 'dual opposites' to convey the idea of twofold oppositions, and got the same reaction.           ;I didn't get a chance to read all of the comments above (there are a lot of them!), but generally, I agree with your frustrations. I was very, very displeased with the reviewers comments for my first essay because three of the four did not say ANYTHING about what I did well.   Like someone else pointed out, the professor states that we should provide constructive criticism AND include something that the writer did well.   On that particular essay, I was criticized for using the passive voice, when in fact, I was using the active voice! I can't remember the exact sentence that was used by the reviewer to make his point, but the sentence was written in active voice, and I think it was written in the present progressive tense. This must have confused the reviewer. It just really bothers me to be criticized for doing something wrong when I know it wasn't wrong. Plus, like others mentioned, it's difficult to swallow some of these reviews not knowing what kind of credentials these fellow students have. No offense to the very young fellow students in this class, but I don't see how a 12-year-old is going to be able to assess me on my grammatical structure. I think it's great that individuals this young are embarking on this educational journey, so I don't mean to be rude in this regard. I would feel much differently if I knew a professor was the one grading my essays.;In my essay on Dracula by Bram Stoker,   I tried to look at the novel and the author's motivation in a new light.   I'm sure most of you have heard   the different themes, symbols, etc. that have been discussed over the years.   The fear and desire, attraction and repulsion, the sexuality...the list goes on and on.   In looking at the novel as a good horror story and considering that perhaps that was the intention of the author, I apparently hit a nerve with some people.   To answer the question, have you read the book - yes, several times.   I thought that this class was about writing to enlighten our peers and, while I may not be a very good writer, I do try to look at these stories in a new way.    In response to the comment that I shouldn't discuss non-literary topics - I wasn't aware that discussing the possibility that Dracula was just a  really good horror story written by an imaginative man from bits and pieces he probably gathered during his travels was discussing a non-literary topic.    I do understand that many of you may be more experienced in writing these essays, but let me remind you that some of us are 54 years old and due to circumstances were not able to attend college.   I am here to learn but I don't think commenting that an essay is ""...not entertaining or provocative...it is lackluster."" is very helpful to the writer.   This is especially so as no suggestions were made that might have been helpful.For those of you that did make suggestions on how to improve the essay, thank you very much.;Unless you've seen Farscape, you may not get this (I do it not to offend those sensitive to true profanity), but:Frell'em.

I know in my last essay on Frankenstein I was told that abortion is a mordern issue and should not have been used. However, abortion did exist in the 1800s. It was viewed as socially unacceptable, however it was there. So to say mentioning abortion when discussing the parent child relationship between characters in Frankenstein  is not a modern view. I think an open dialogue could have cleared up that assumption and help with future issues like plagerism questions or concerns. A lot of poeple seem to be having issues with the peer evaluations.  ;I get tired of people who don't read the entire piece it seems. For instance, I said ""This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world"". Then went on to say that is the core reason behind Frankenstein destorying the second creature and places him in the role of a mother in relationship to the creatures. I had one reviewer who said it was a weak argument even if it was relevant because there are many reasons for abortions. There are, but that is why I used the word some and, in the context of the argument, that is the one that fits because the essay was about parent-child relationships NOT abortion. It was just one aspect. There seems to be qualifiers that are missed and people are interpreting statements as absolutes.  ;Hey, I just got accused of plagiarizing from my own writing, whatever that could possibly mean.;I just want to say, after reading The Raven so many times, it's such an ear-bug.

I can accept multiple theses or a multi-part thesis, but if there isn't some sort of unifying statement, the whole thing just rambles.   I don't know if this is just my own personal bias, but almost all of the essays I've read that have a clear thesis and follow it are excellent.   They're easy to follow and intelligent.   So many I read that don't have one are unfocused.   Plus, the way I was taught in school, for it to be an essay it has to have a thesis.   The Work Expectations page does say something about this. It says ""using those notes and reviewing the work, we can come to a hypothesis about what that significance might be.""   The stuff on the actual peer review page talks about whether the argument is persuasive and if it is well supported.   Some of these essays don't have an argument.   ;This is something that confuses me too as I believe on most weeks I have only received the feedback of 4 peers; it seems wrong if I am reviewing 5 or more to only have 4 come back...;Most have heard that E.A. Poe gets some cognac left on his grave every year.       Just wanted to give a shout out to Nathaniel Hawthorne on his birthday.Favorite Hawthorne quote?     Mine is from a letter to his sister upon the birth of his son Julian:     : ""A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew.""Hawthorne was not who most of us think he was having been force fed The Scarlett Letter in High School.My favorite story (of the assigned readings) was The Artist of the Beautiful.     He seems to be saying that you write, you create, for yourself, and not with some audience in mind, because that butterfly you send fluttering out is going to be crushed by some troglodyte.;As writers we learn the importance of characterization in the impact of the story, and within characterization we learn the importance of motivations. Shelley motivates her characters beyond every writer that I have encountered so far.Shelley devotes the first three chapters, 67 pages (twenty percent of the book,) to characterizing Victor by depicting the circumstances that shaped his character.As for technique, Shelley motivatesa. In layers: if an action of Victor   s father was crucial in motivating Victor, Shelley also gives the father   s motivations, and sometimes more layers. For example: Shelley provides motivation on why Victor   s mother adopted Elizabeth: because she had endured poverty and was relieved out of it by Victor's father marrying her. Shelley motivates beyond that and tells us why she was in poverty, why Victor's father married her, and again in another level, her father's misfortune in his merchant career, and also Elizabeth   s history.  b.  By multiple reasons: Shelley doesn   t stop if she provided one reason for an action. She gives reasons until we would be surprised if the action didn   t happen. For example: When Elizabeth is adopted into Victor's family, Shelley gives three motivations for Victor   s lack of sibling rivalry: 1. He is showered, and always was, with parental love. 2. Elizabeth is extraordinarily kind. 3. His mother gives her to him as a present, his own to love and cherish. This pattern repeats for every action that Shelley motivates.  c.  Using mini-stories: such as the story of the merchant who was the father of Victor   s mother. These mini-stories have their beginning, middle, and end, with a flavor of oral fairy tales. They deliver stand-alone pleasures adding to the overall impact.In my view, the mini-story technique with its added pleasures, presents a crucial element in propelling the extensive, multi-reason, multi-layer motivating pages Shelley provides.;   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre. But at the same time, it gives certain critical messages in a subtle and cunning way.It expresses the status of women writers in that period. The fact that Mary Shelley chose three narrators for the story telling and all of them being male; the passive women characters; our notions about them being moulded by the perceptions of the    male    narrators and finally Victor creating the    creature    without the involvement of women; all point towards the fact that women were unrepresented or underrepresented in the literary society of that period in which intellectual was synonymous with men and women were meant to be the angels at home.Moreover, women not being involving in the creation might be a reaction to Erasmus Darwin who blamed women for all monstrous births.It also shows what happens when science crosses its limits and men break the laws of nature to become gods (creators). Men make discoveries and inventions, leading to uncontrollable applications which turn disastrous.Again, in a less visible manner the story displays the ill effects of extreme ambition and lack of patience. Had Victor been patient in creating the creature using proper body parts, he would not have been a monster (   As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature   ). Although Victor apparently wanted to be a benefactor, he was always concerned about his own glory and thought him of more ability than he actually was (  _first success to permit me to doubt of my    ability    to give life  _).To sum it all,    Frankenstein    is a wonderful novel with meaningful messages.FORMpeer 1      You have satisfactory structure and you are able to support your arguments. Though, you have some grammatical mistakes and it would be better if you had done some research and had used references.peer 2      There are some sentences with structure problems, e.g. ""   Frankenstein   , its numerous imitations and parodies, filmic adaptations, all depicting a hideous and grotesque creature of disproportioned stature, forcing the readers into a state of exciting fear surely establishes it as a novel of horror genre"" - this sentences needs to be broken into at least 2 to be less confusing or to have a more accurate punctuation. Another example ""Moreover, women not being involving [involved] in the creation"" In general, the ideas are comprehensible and the author shows a good use of vocabulary, connectors and grammar.peer 3      The first sentence doesn't make sense. To establish a book as a novel of horror genre, you don't need numerous imitations and parodies. Maybe, you were trying to say something else. Anyway, I think the structure and the grammar are good.peer 4      A few grammatical errors; you divide your essay into logical, effective paragraphs. However, I could not find an overarching thesis or argument in your essay, so while your divisions between topics were clear, your paragraphs did not relate to a specific argument/goal.peer 5      Although it was nice that your paragraphs weren't blocky, I think some of the sentences should have been incorporated into their own paragraphs rather than standing alone. I would also be careful with ending paragraphs with a quote instead of analysis.CONTENTpeer 1      Your first idea about passive women is a very interesting topic. I would advise you to fathom this concept more, instead of trying to discuss a new topic, as you are doing after the first two paragraphs.peer 2      The main point is compelling and it makes for an interesting idea. However, last paragraph and conclusion seem unrelated to the main topic. In such a short essay it is not very recommendable to have various topics. It could be much productive and convincing to stick to one main argument.peer 3      I find it interesting that Shelley used only men as narrators, and it's a good point. The passive nature of women, the limits of science, and the ill effect of ambition, are all hidden inside the novel. But your essay could be better if it was aiming only on one theme.peer 4      In all of your paragraphs/subtopics, you make valid and effective arguments; however, your lacking a single theme overall for your essay prevents these different areas of interest from coming together into a logical argument. While the reader's understanding of the novel is enriched by your essay, your essay itself lacks a ""point"".peer 5      While you touched on a lot of interesting topics, I think you could strengthen your essay by narrowing your focus onto one topic and examining it in detail. I would also caution against using your subjective opinion about the novel in a literary essay.TOTAL 3;I found the parent-child relationships, specifically along the lines of abandonment, in  Frankenstein. This is shown in more ways than just the abandonment of the creature by Victor. Justine   s mother abandons her, while Elizabeth   s mother dies and her father leaves her with an uncle. In relation the creature, he feels like Victor, who can be seen as God or his father, has abandoned him. This leaves the creature to learn and develop without any guidance or teachings to help in determining how to properly interact with people or what is right and wrong. Victor consistently neglects his responsibility to love and protect his child-creature. This is the first instance of rejection the creature experiences. Each one the follows increases his anger and pain. It also serves to remind him of the first rejection, the rejection of his father and creator, and he does not understand the proper way to wrestle with these emotions. When Victor chooses to destroy the bride, the only companion the creature feels could possibly accept him, it is not different than an abortion. It is the destruction of life, or the potential life, before    birth   . This reinforces the idea that it is a parent-child relationship. While there are times when God in the Bible has destroyed his creations, it always based on the sins of those involved. In Victor   s case, he does not want to bring another creature into the world. This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world and raise it. Given his history, it is doubtful Victor would have treated this one any differently. The pain the first creation feels can then be seen as much more than just the loss of a companion. It was the loss of a sister, the loss of family. This would be even more painful given the fact it was his own   father that destroyed her.  ;This is my latest effort. What I found interesting was the peer reviews, the shortest I've received yet. Peer 1 and peer 3 only wrote in the last box. If they are this short now, I wonder what they'll be like by the time of the Doctorow book!Any comments on the essay would be appreciated :)HMary Shelley wrote  Frankenstein  as a clever allegory of the French Revolution, the event that caused a seismic shift in the intellectual culture of England. It was the French Revolution that had had a profound influence of her parents, the philosopher William Godwin and feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, who had lived through the Revolution's hopes and despairs, and who had written powerful social commentaries on the events on the continent. The novel can be seen as a homage to their beliefs.The main events in  Frankenstein  mirror the circumstances of the Revolution. Before the creation of the Being/Revolution, there was a period of enlightenment and intellectual struggle against old traditional belief systems, best seen in the novel by Frankenstein's time at university. Victor Frankenstein represents reformers who were swept along by the revolutionary events. Initial there is a period of fear for the future and for many a worry of going too far, as when Frankenstein ran from the monster that he had created. As with the revolutionaries Danton and Robespierre, he saw the dangers of the forces he had unleashed. Yet, as Robespierre was to become tyrannical in creating the Terror, so Frankenstein, in his destruction of the Being's half-constructed partner, also acted repressively, which caused a wave of violence that destroyed all that was close to him.In the end, the ideals of the Revolution burnt out, with France, and much of the rest of Europe, returning to the traditionalist fold. Similarly, the Being ends its life, going to the northern wastelands, saying 'soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascent my funeral pile triumphantly...the light of that conflagration will fade away'. The novel ends with the words 'lost in darkness and distance', representing a loss of the ideals of the Revolution, itself an Enlightenment-created monster.M. Shelley,  Frankenstein  (London, 1818)R.

You are right of course. :);Unfortunately it only got 4.5...next time! It was fun doing it though :);Academic works oftentimes use footnotes, end notes and a bibliography (sometimes one or two or all of them, depending on the work) and the works cited box doesn't specify bibliography only, so I don't see a problem with it, but I'm not 100% sure.   ;I feel the same way. One of my reviewers said that I relied on quotes too much when I only used THREE. I feel like there's no pleasing people. If I use quotes, I rely on them too much. If I don't, then I get marked down for not using them. And another reviewer said that my theme was ""shallow"". I'm so sorry my theme wasn't all ~deep and meaningful~ for you. Just because you don't resonate with my theme it doesn't mean that you should mark me down for it.;I agree. This was my first essay, I did not write any before because I was pretty busy, but I am genuinely thrilled with comments, both positive and negative. It really helped a lot and I can see the points made and where I went wrong in my writing.  I would also like to say I am sorry if my own assessments were ""lazy"" or too short, I really did everything in a very short time because I did not want to miss the opportunity to continue with this course. Next time, I will try to do better.  Also, one of the comments was regarding my lack of quotations. I read the book in my native language and , as I stated before, had really little time to write the essay. Finding exact quotations and incorporating them in the text would have taken more time that I had on my hands. I will also try to improve that part.  To the anon above: I too got one comment about my essay being somewhat shallow. Lacking depth. It is truly weird, because I gave it a lot of thought. Sure, it lacked structure and my thesis was introduced too late but that does not make it shallow.  I really find it difficult to say all I want to say with 320 words limitation. I know the reasons for the limit, but I do not agree with them. 500 words would be just fine.  ;I understand why some might think citations are needed. What is apparent and obvious to you, might not be apparent and obvious to me. Thus, you cite the part that you are writing about so that everything would be transparent.  On the other hand, it is much accentuated that we are writing for intelligent and attentive student, and we ALL read the same book. It should be apparent   what we are talking about. Especially when we are writing a 320 words essay, not a 30 pages thesis.;I just find it funny that my essay was considered ""shallow"" when I related how the creation appeared to be a monster on the outside and how Victor was a monster on the inside, and how this led to him abandoning his philosophy. What... do you expect me to relate it to Freud or Christianity or some-sh*t?;Yeah, I thought about it. Of course, it would have to take place later, after the course is done because I have another course going.  Cool blogs, both of you. :);Lorem Ipsum,   that's what I might as well type to fill in the 320 words for the next essay.I think I've about had it with this peer review nonsense.   ;I'm mostly getting 4's so no complaints there but the comments are arbitrary, contradictory and sometimes ignorant.

There is no need of being condescending and argue a valid point by using these erroneous and unproven assumptions.If you have a personal distaste for the British form of the language, that's just that, a personal preference.

My peers are expected to be at a level of English that they know the difference. The standard is not your average American, it is whatever English your are being asked to read. Since the book Frankenstein was written in British English, and my peers supposedly have read the book as expected, how can they justify telling me my English is wrong when they just read a whole book in British English. Seems very discriminatory to me. Anyway, thanks again for your suggestion. ;This is a literature class but again you have to look at the demographic. They may have read a book in British English, however they may not understand that is the way you write so when they see it outside quotes they take it as typos. Plus, although this is supposed to be higher learning, there are a wide range of ages and professions. Not everyone may have taken a college English class years while others may be about the start their fifth one. I disagree with the standard being set by the book. I do type grey rather gray even though I grew up in US. I am not going to change that because the novel uses a different form. However, I do not expect someone to change their spelling and writing style to fit a BrE text either.  ;I agree with your thought process. I just don't agree with the concept of what you are saying. As a British English speaking literature student, I know there are other types of English out there, so I don't judge either way. It may mean more work for me to check whether my American peers are misspelling or not, but that's only fair. Since this is an advanced undergraduate course (says so in the recommended background part of the course description), my peers should already know these differences. If they don't know this, then they took this course without complying with the requirements of the course, namely being of an advanced undergraduate level. Why should my grades suffer for that. ;Este Post estuvo un poco intenso. Demasiadas pasiones se desataron, demasiados detalles personales.

The professor has a really wonderful idea though, of presenting the material in a way that builds upon experimental fact/data/history, so you really think through the development of chemistry, rather than being told, ""This is how you solve this type of problem. Now go do it X more times.""   It really made me appreciate and learn chemistry much more!

In my area, one of the major pages was the subject of a back-and-forth war over the inclusion of one paper. It was a real crowd pleaser, in a good journal and quite subversive (against the established theories) so it made the news. I'm a world-expert in the area but I was editing anonymously (for my own reasons) and suggested caution and inclusion but with a proviso of a requirement for validation. My edits were repeatedly removed and eventually dismissed as the ravings of a bitter student (!) by a senior WikiP 'priest' (it is in a good journal so it must be right) - so I gave up. A year later, the whole paper was discredited as experimentally flawed and retracted under a bit of a scandal of fraud (hence this anonymity now because it is still sensitive). It is still included there in WikiP though!!! So - WikiP is great, I use it myself extensively. It is usually better than expected if you look in an area where you are an expert - I am not knocking Wikipedia, it has become the Encyclopaedia Galactica.  If you had read that entry at a time with my cautious view though, you might have got a different opinion of the paper than when it was 'corrected' by the authorised but actually quite (understandably) naive wiki-staff. Stuff in Wikipedia changes over time. If however, you quote the original references - then people can make up their own minds. It is not dishonest because Wikipedia is not original research and is usually a Frankenstein of opinions (which is usually a good thing because it is self regulating to an extent). However, beware pages that have lots of edits in their history because you may be sampling one battle in a wiki war - and my experience is that wiki wars are won by the people with most time - not most knowledge. Yes - you should read the original if you can, there is much too much 'apostolic referencing' going on in general - you can actually track it by inherited mistakes in references (fun to do). -sermon ends- ;I really thought we could go through this fast:};you can only use 410=(4x4)-(4!/4)as for 11, can't think of anything...;It's written that 4.4 might be used, but only 4 included11=44/(sqrt(4x4));34=4!+(4!/4)+438=44-(4!/4)I believe we might not be able to use square.

I like the History and Art History courses. ;My take is that Wells, who was a Socialist and a member of the Fabian Society (they wouldn't have believed in 'revolutionary change' but a kind of languid change over time) was in fact writing a satire in The Invisible Man not of Science per se, but the Individual against society.     It takes a village to subdue Griffin.     Also, this is a kind of inversion of the Judeo-Christian ethic, with the corporeal becoming incorporeal instead of vice versa.     Griffin is the opposite of the Christ-God, because he dies for his own sins, not for the sins of the community.     He is a kind of negative sacrifice.     The Reign of Terror that Griffin threatens to invoke is meaningful in this context, and I believe refers to Robespierre and the French Revolution, that product of the Age of Reason gone terribly wrong.     People can be just as fanatic and religous about science and reason as they can about religion.     I think Wells loved Science, but you also get the feeling reading these works that he was terrified of a Science unchecked by Ethics (vivisection in both Moreau and the Invisible Man, Moreau and Griffin operating out of culturally sanctioned bounds in both novels etc).     As an aside, what I love about Wells is that you can tell he loves the 'little people'.     The bumpkins and workmen etc.     Griffin despises them.;M. Gonzalez, I think you are right not to trust anonymous posts - I don't think Coursera should allow them.     This kind of ties into the Invisible Man, because anonymity is a sort of invisibility on the internet.       Folks who post anonymously tend to be the ones the most abusive of netiquette.     As for me, I have no nefarious purposes.     I'm trying to use Suaron's ring to do good!       Speaking of which, Plato's dialog on the Ring of Gyges is very relevant to this story and The Lord of the Rings.;In my essay which I just submitted I try to make the case that Griffin is merely an antagonist - the real protagonist/hero of the novel is the people with Kemp as a kind of stand-in.;Both writers and reviewers are evolving.  ;@Poulomi: we also have Yama, the Indian/Hindu version of Hades.

The novel  Black cat  has associations with demons and witchcraft; makes you question where the origins of evil dwell.     Firstly, the cat is demonic. The cats, especially black, are the familiars of witches. Also, its name Pluto relates to the antique god of the underworld. The cat provokes ill     temper, while changing person   s character. Still for the longest time (of all animals) tenderness towards Pluto remains     as a contract between human and devil, whilst devil is nourished with evil deeds,  pet stays affectionate to its owner, but once it is offended,  sets the  fire in the house. So, the cat might be a cause of events.     Also, there might be a presumption that man himself was transforming into devil, while the cat was only a catalyst. This transformation required for the bigger sins     murder of loved ones, which only started with Pluto. Taking out an eye, can be associated to the cat   s night vision, which is almost as seeing other world of impurities,  intimidates main character, that his evil side might be detected.     What is more, the cat has clear relation with the wife. The second cat has spot on fur, and wife   s white hair reminds of it, provokes further evilness. The white itself is ghostly color, or maybe because of its relation to purity, and sense of the need to taint it. When the wife is buried in the cellar the cat disappears. It reappears only when the remains are found, as if linked to the body. Also, wife defends pet with bare hand against axe, and is not offended by ill- temper of her husband, raises suspicion that she might have deeper relations to the causes     the cat and the demons.   We reach few conclusions - either the cat is the cause of demonic behavior, the wife is a witch, either the man is at fault.  FORM:peer 1      I've had to give you a 1 for Form because there were quite a few grammatical errors. The main one is that you often miss out 'the', 'a', 'its', 'his' or 'her' before nouns (e.g. in the fourth paragraph, it should be ""THE second cat has a spot on ITS fur""). Sometimes you're using them but most of the time you miss them out. If you worked on this, it would make a big difference to the essay. There were a couple of other minor errors - in the last sentence you used 'either...either'. It should be 'either...or...' (so ""the wife is a witch OR the man is at fault""). Your vocabulary was good.peer 3      Good attempt however there were quite a few grammatical and vocabulary errors. I think you need a stronger conclusion.peer 4      Several grammar mistakes hinders the clarity of your essay quite significantly. You are missing some small words in sentences, improper placement of commas, or misusing words to name a few.Content:peer 1      You could have expanded your conclusion more but apart from this you had a lot of interesting ideas and managed to fit quite a lot in to your essay. You noticed quite a range of symbolism from even just the cat character. I've given you a 2 for Content.peer 3      I like that you chose to discuss evil however in some parts the argument seemed lost, I feel you might have focused too much on analyzing one story that your examples or motivation for choosing this topic was not as clear. I would suggest that you use Evil as the underlying theme and then look for strong examples from multiple stories to support it, perhaps the absence of Faith in the characters is what creates Evil?peer 4      Your conclusion is obscure, it does not relate back to your thesis. However, I think your content is actually quite good, nice depth in analysis.Total score: 3;I appreciate that you guys read it, even if it is graded lower. The thought about witch got my own attention, which was basically keeping me writing this essay:D;Thank you for corrections, it would be hard to use it for essay, because I barely made through word count. If I had to chose one interpretation, I would chose the most boring one - only about cat itself. How could I not share wife being a witch ( which is a weak interpretation on its own)? If I'm able to see several interpretations why not sharing it.;As for peer 3, I couldn't add more stories because structure now quite logical, one conclusion about origins of evil per paragraph. And I was highly motivated for this topic, because I write fiction myself in related topic.;Nature as the personification of 'woman,' as with Mother Nature (something to be controlled and penetrating its secrets)) - never thought about that!

Guess what I grade?peer 2      Good job on form - no big errors. Intro, middle and conclusion were there. A couple of issues with your rhyming scheme (number of syllables), but really nice poem :)peer 3      A poem was an interesting choice to convey your message. It was well done, better than I could ever do. You did good with both rhyme and meter. It wasn't an essay, but it was still grammatically correct.peer 4      Perfect, just perfect! I am totally impressed!CONTENT  peer 1      The matter of the Unit 5 is not delved into. You stay at the surface of the tales. You have not analyzed in depth any argument of the stories. You only named a couple of titles and made a summary of respective plots.peer 2      Your poem was lovely, but it did make it a bit harder to find the thesis. You did a good job considering your self-imposed constraints, but I think you could have had a meatier argument if you'd written an essay.peer 3      You didn't really add many thoughts beyond summaries of a couple of stories. There wasn't an in-depth analysis of any work, and you seemed to write mostly about the reading process in general.peer 4      Best essay EVER!!! Hooray! I wish I could give you more than a 3!

Because you ask this frequently. You are damned by the very thought that you are mad. It is not me whom you are asking it; you doubt and question yourself.  Again you hear things in heaven, earth and hell. The disease which has sharpened your senses is    madness   .  How! How! Didn   t I tell the story healthily and calmly?  So, you think, telling a story calmly makes you sane. And killing a man calmly and quietly hides your insanity. Are you trying to fool me? You killed an old man just because of what appears to be a cataract. Or was it his gold that compelled you?  No, no! It was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.  You consider the old mad and his eye as two discrete identities. And you are sane?  Didn   t you notice with what dexterity I committed the crime? Can a madman do this?    You are whimsical!  You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings. And why are you troubled many a night, just at midnight, when all the world sleeps?  You thought the neighbours would hear his heart but you yourself yelled while attacking? Is it the perfect way of doing a crime? The only thing you wanted was him to look at you, with his eye so that your blood would run cold and you could do a cold blooded murder.  Don   t mock me. I must scream or die! And now again!     hark! Louder! Louder! Louder! Louder!-  It   s not his heart that you listen, it   s yours. It   s your guilt that needs confession. In the     Tale Tell heart    it   s your heart that is telling the story. The old man is dead, stone dead.         peer 3      Last paragraph: ""you hear"", not ""you listen"". Glad you made the mistake as it made the essay more your own.  peer 4      Accurately and clearly written - an interesting pastiche of Poe.  peer 5      I'm not exactly sure how to rate your essay. It does not meet the expectations of an academic essay, and yet, I can't help to recognize the brilliance of your stream of consciousness commentary. I am a fiction writer myself, so I understand how much effort you must have put into this work. As a consequence, I like to honor writer's attempts to step outside of the box, so I'll give you a ""3"" for form.  peer 6      I couldn't find grammar mistakes.      peer 1      I am sorry, but I don't understand exactly what you want to tell us with your essay; how do we understand that the narrator is insane and unreliable? You don't show us that.  peer 2      Maybe, for you, there are a shadowing idea somewhere between your words, but I'm really sorry, i couldn't find it. and there are not connections between your words. the approach of madness doesn't fit.  peer 3      I'm not sure where Poe leaves off and you begin!  peer 4      The dialogue is amusing but not necessarily convincing; the non-Poe line of thought does not fully create a line of argument that persuades this reader.  peer 5      Again, I'm not sure how to score your content because you've done something entirely different than any other writer I've read during this course. You present some very good ideas towards the end of the essay. However, the first 2/3rds of the essay feels to me like all form and no substance other than establishing that you're writing a stream of consciousness commentary. The meat of the essay begins with ""You think you are omniscient. How could you know what an old man thinks from a mere groan? You just empathetically attach it with your own feelings."" As a result, I'm going to rate your content as a ""2.""  peer 6      It is not an essay. There's no argument or analysis on it.      peer 1      I was impressed with your essay. If we were a class of creative writing I could give you a ""3"". I can imagine you in a class telling these, I am sure that all the students will follow you with a lot of attention, may be more than others's essays. But, without a face to face presentation, your text is very confused.  peer 2      Are you trying to fool me? or fool all the fellows students? you give me the pieces but there aren't a puzzle. I tried really hard to listen the sound of your biting heart, but there are not heart. there are no sound. sorry to be your butcher, and i wash my hands.  peer 5      I really enjoyed reading your piece. It's certainly a bold move. It shows that you not only analyzed Poe's big ideas, you also paid attention to specific phrasings, etc. This type of essay fits well with a literature class.  peer 6          score: 2+1;Thanks everyone for the inspiring words. And Javier I am no more concerned about the grades. I have a couple of 3s now, mostly because of not writing the traditional essay. But I am having a wonderful time with the course but I will be experimenting with the form and narration.  ;    Martha Ellen WaggonerYour essay...Is all made of quotations from wikipedia (which is not the best   source). Also, I'm studying science and even we don't need to remember so much about fixating.

Wish you best!;You original just for choosing poem -firs my read poem essay:) about necrophilia.. It just occur me that maybe this was a prophetic poem (because his last ) about his own death. Poems have tendency to foretell future sometimes. Maybe not, I'm not knowledgeable about Poe's life;I like your essay and enjoyed reading it. I particularly like the comparison you made with Icarus, and the references to ""Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese ""version of Icarus."" If I had reviewed it,   I would have made a couple of suggestions regarding the form, specifically, just to tighten it up. For example, I think the second paragraph reiterates the first. I like the main idea you presented, but I think it would have worked better by omitting the Genesis reference and including it in your thesis. This would have left more room for analysis, as the third paragraph contained a little too much summary and not enough of your own original content with quotes from the text to support it.   I hope this helps, but overall, good job!;Aleksandar, your English is not bad. Basically, your sentence structure is fine, if a little awkward in places. Plus, there are a few instances where articles are either used when they aren't needed or are omitted, but these are minor mistakes. To save time, I'm only writing the corrections. For instance, It should read ""In ancient Greece."" Plus, by substituting a few words, this one would read better as ""This motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, which we can determine by examining the stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese versions of Icarus respectively.""   Also, this sentence is a little long, and could be simplified. ""Although their  stories of ""claiming the Sun"" are different for each character, the actual cause is the same (striving for perfection), as is the final outcome of death.  There are a couple of other places where the sentence structure is awkward like, ""When comparing the ""modern"" world with ancient cultures, we often time claim ""progress and prosperity"" in the name of  science and technology. (We sometimes believe) their advanced applications allow us to create a more developed society, one more evolved and better in all respects. From here, you could link the next paragraph with this one by starting, with, One such instance can be found in the short-story ""The Birthmark'""  As you can see, it's really a matter of cutting out unnecessary words, combining your thoughts into concise sentences when you can do so, and building your vocabulary. These things will all fall into place in time, so relax, you're doing fine.;I have gotten peer reviews like this, too.   It makes this course.... interesting, in a frustrating sort of way.;For the Wells essay,   I came up with an idea.   Then I wondered if anyone else ever thought these thoughts so I Googled some key words and discovered that someone had very similar ideas as mine.   In the reading of their article,   a few more refinements were added to my original idea.

After 24 years, fellow Midwesterners who live here still randomly say, ""Hey, you're from Michigan!"" but when I go up north, I can hear that slight southern edge to my vowels.

Over the years, I've discovered that for me bullet pointing makes everything alright. It's much easier for me to jot things down, connect the dots, and merge points when the ideas are separated out that way. It also took being out of education for many years to gain the confidence to just ask what is expected and how best to meet that expectation (or run like the clappers from it).  It's marvellous to have really clearly stated expectations AND a slew of resources to help us meet them. The video clips and the student essay portfolios on the wiki are immensely helpful and reassuring.  I've never taken notes *as* I read before. ... stopping to take notes threw me out of the story (and I love story!). This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.I  understand how stop-start reading breaks the flow. I find it impossible to read anything first time round while taking notes. My plan is to read once for pleasure, make some bullet points about overall impressions, then read again while taking notes.;Oh, I hear you on class and academia! Though the late 60s and 70s saw a lot of university fees paid for by the state in the UK, and so a lot more working class academics were in place by the late 80s, there was still a real skew towards the culture of the public school when I was there. I just continuously assumed I was wrong or stupid or just incompetent, whereas now I know that there was a systemic failure to transition kids from ordinary state schools to universities. Some of my lecturers were really great, and one gave extra-curricular classes on writing for his course, but the overwhelming majority were, I think, blissfully unaware that any of us needed any support.I reckon a bunch of people I was at uni with got their degrees despite the obstacles, not because they got help. I dropped out due to chronic illness, but ended up hanging out with a bunch of academics later in life more by accident than anything. Most of them had undergone similar experiences, and were determined that their students wouldn't suffer the same fate. I learned enough of The Rules second-hand from them to stop beating myself up for having ""failed"". I have a whole patented rant about institutionalised dysfunctional behaviours I have observed as I watched friends go through the post-grad grinder.I need to get on to the Doctorow. He's the only author on the list I haven't read, and yet he's been recommended to me by so many people it's ridiculous. Vonnegut, you say? I'm sold.;I'm quickly skimming through the student portfolios available on the course wiki to get a flavour of the diversity in style and focus to expect - as well as to reassure myself about the process of writing for the course! I'd recommend it as an exercise in reassurance as well as building excitement :);I didn't write notes in any of the books.From memory,  a child has doodled on one of the pages of Alice in Wonderland but that just adds to the charm!Regards;Russell T Davies did wonders for Doctor Who.;RTD is certainly awesome and would go as far as to say his time on DW changed the face of SF on television.  ;Wow! That is wonderfully sweet of you, thank you so much! I may very well take you up on that, as my own explorations of my computer have yielded little in the way of useful voice features. I actually did manage to get my hands on an audio copy of le Guin's book -- about the only one so far. Thank you so much for the offer! If you can help me figure out some screen reading options for Windows XP, that would be fantastic. I tried it yesterday, but the voice only wanted to read my tool bar, not the document I was looking at. I've been thinking of looking into programs like JAWS and Dragon, but my computer is on its last legs and I'm pretty sure I don't want to buy more software for XP, only to have to upgrade to Windows 8 and reinstall everything. So right now I'm stuck with only what came with my operating system. ;All but the Le Guin are available for free on Project Gutenberg, where you can download for Kindle and read onscreen.LibriVox may have some of the audio books for free - I recall the Grimms' and Carroll's work being there.Megan, you realise you've just outed yourself as one of those people that technologically-challenged folk like me pester for information, right?Update:In this thread, there's a discussion of free audio books for the course from LibriVox:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=35  So far, people say  Carrol, Stoker, Shelly are definitely available there.;This is great stuff to be aware of and share.;I don't think there is an absolute answer to your question, Claire, but I'll give you my opinion. By Katrina's definition above, and by the one given by Prof. Rabkin, as you point out, *all* fiction is fantasy - at least, all *good* fiction should ""invite suspension of reality."" Even if a novel is a ""slice of life"" work, by its very nature, it is a fictional world, and not actual events that happened in anyone's reality - otherwise it would be a biography.As someone who writes ""slice of life,"" I've been asking myself your question since seeing the first set of videos. Is, then, what *I* write fantasy?Yes and no.Yes, in the sense that it is all a fictional (and hopefully immersive) world. One that closely resembles our own, but in which the protagonists deal with Big Things perhaps more often than average. Sometimes those things are good, sometimes they are bad. Sometimes the characters win, and sometimes not. The biggest way in which my ""universe"" differs from the real one is that the protagonists are rather better communicators than Joe Average. They are not preternaturally so in any way; rather, being good communicators is a survival skill and a cultural talent they value, so it's something they've worked to cultivate. But that's the most fantastic thing about them. Well, that and the fact that they're meant to be dead.No no, don't misunderstand, they're human. A hundred percent human. They just should be dead by *now*. No, it's not Tuck Everlasting. They're just regular people, leading regular lives... but they both have a disease which should have killed them long ago, and it hasn't. No, it's not a supernatural or special disease. It exists in this world. And they're not particularly strong, or healthy, for that matter - just lucky. Like many thousands of people who wake up every day and go about their daily lives when statistics say they should be dead. Some of the plot is about how they cope with that - most of it isn't.I have explained my ""universe"" in this way for a reason - if I did my ""job,"" did you notice how quickly you were willing to accept that there might be something fantastical going on? And yet, they are very average people with, for the most part, average lives. But part of a writer's job is to capture your attention and your imagination at the same time. To say, ""Come with me....and trust me."" If you can't get the reader to come along, your work is for naught. But once they've come along, they have to trust that you're going to lay out some rules, any rules, and abide by them.   The rules can be as mundane or ridiculous as the author likes, but they have to stay consistent within the narrative. Now that I've told you why my characters aren't dead, and emphatically explained that there is no supernatural cause, it would be cheap for me to say, ""but actually, they're secretly vampires."" I'd be breaking the rules I set out, and thus breaking the ""contract"" between myself and the reader(s). At the same time, hopefully the reader has that little niggle in the back of their mind - why are *these* people alive? Why those specific people? Is there possibly a reason that even the protagonists haven't uncovered? Or is the universe just that fickle? That is one of the spaces in which I play. I like that sandbox.So that's how all fiction *can* be fantasy - done well, it primes you to accept anything. (What would be the point of reading Sherlock if, in the back of your mind, you didn't wonder if *this time* he might miss something? You trust that in the end, he'll solve the mystery - he's Sherlock Holmes! But maybe, just maybe...)Here then is why what I write *isn't* fantasy - there's nothing otherworldly in it. By the common definition, fantasy must contain at least one *impossible* (not just unlikely) element. Harry Potter has magic. C.S. Lewis has Narnia. Naomi Novik has talking dragons fighting historical battles in the Air Force. My protagonists aren't impossible, since, as I said, they have a real disease with real consequences that real people in this world have survived for extraordinary periods, too. Not impossible, just unlikely.By the latter measure, Sherlock Holmes and other such characters (Poirot, etc) are fantasy because they belong more to the world of archetype than reality. As much as you think they *might* fail (and that's important, because without it, there is no dramatic tension), you trust that they *won't* fail. It would break the rules (and shatter your trust) to read a Great Detective story where the detective bumbles around, stomps on the evidence, blows the case, and at no point saves the day.... all because he hasn't had his coffee.That's why the latter metric is more useful to me; and probably more practical to use in the everyday world. But I do like the idea that all good fiction is fantasy in its own way, simply because a good writer can (and might) take you anywhere.;Thank you all for taking the time to respond. Megan, your illustration was the light I needed, thank you. I feel more comfortable going forward now. I will enjoy relating the stories in the reading list to this new thought about the 'limits' of fantasy. I will have to look out for your stories as well. I write only fact and read only fiction :)   ;Interesting point Megan. I had read, among the many things said about 50 shades, that it began life as vampire fiction.  When it comes to using genre as a selling point it is tricky subject. When people look for books they start with genre, how will your book be found? Even factual books can be difficult to categorize. Unfortunately difficult to categorize books don't sell well.  ;Megan,That is good advice for peer reviewers. I never said, though, that I wanted the process to change, and I already gave an example of another class that does not have to go to this extreme. I am not telling the professor how to run his class, as everyone seems to think. I simply stated that I was confused and if the grading is a specific way, I would not fully participate. That is my choice. I understand everything that's been said, but this goes against what I stand for as a student and as a teacher. I am still excited to learn from the professor and the peers, just not through the writing assignments.  ;My concern would have been that you dropped out without giving it a fair chance, Katrina.   Don't leave before we get to play with you!   ;Megan - I 100% agree with you in re: Irish folk tales. I would argue that they are more complete. Characters are complex, have struggles to overcome (or fail to overcome....). The story arcs are complete. There is a sense of realistic consequences to actions....;Anahita, it's an interesting topic you've started. It's a question I've been asking to myself for a long time, as fairy-tales are the only literature from my childhood that I can read again and again and it doesn't matter if I know the plot already or not. I think one of the reasons is their simplicity. You don't have to make your brain sweat to understand what's written there and then, as they lack lots of details, there is room for your own imagination and it's definitely pleasant to build up all these castles, forests, wicked witches and princesses in your mind.;Theres a lot of fantasy and Sci fi to enjoy, The Power Rangers were one of my favorites and Lightspeed and TimeForce are still good if you are into them.Animated Fantasy and Sci Fi besides anime that are good today:Adventure Time just some boschian random sh*t happening all the timeBen 10 it is a great concept well executed in the first seasonTeen Titans (not the new one) and Young Justice if you like DC comicsAvengers Earth Mightiest Heroes if you like Marvelsome years ago some french cartoons boomed and quality tv rised with good shows like Totally Spies and Code LyokoAnime:Shiki contemporary rural town gets vampedAnything Gundam, specially 00 or the originalCode GeassGuilty CrownIRL Sci fi and fantasy are sort of harder to get but Stargate and Game of Thrones are still airing, and of course Battlestar Galactica reason enough to own a netflix account and watch and rewatch it till time ends.;"

The University of Arizona has one of the best and most active collegiate wheelchair basketball teams in the country, actually, so a lot of my friends went there. I had family out there at one point, but I was young and dumb and in my ""being disabled shouldn't have a bearing on where I go to school"" phase, so I never took advantage. U of AZ and University of Illinois are on my shortlist now that I know better. (In a nutshell, whether one intends to play sports or not, any college that has thriving wheelchair sports teams attracts disabled students in greater than average numbers, which results in an accessible campus and a staff that is disability-aware, which means disabled students can focus on what we're there to do - attend class!)Melissa, I'll forgive you. ;) As I said, my stepmother is an Ohio State grad and an otherwise good person, and one of my best friends from high school got his vocal performance/music degrees from there and had great things to say. So I just hate Ohio State in the abstract.... and on game days. :);I just reinstalled thunder on this computer and discovered that the default voice has been changed to Microsoft's Alice (US English). Not a big deal, though Alice sounds a bit clipped unless you slow her down! Also, if you choose to give thunder a go, a little tip - when it first starts, go to settings and adjust things to your liking. Then, go to Run, and choose ""Webbie."" It's a stripped down, high contrast version of Internet  Explorer  with a built in magnifier and other features you might find handy, and from that browser, it will automatically read entire webpages for you (Thunder also reads anything you're doing in any other program, which is what makes it better than Windows Narrator.)The easiest way for *me* to use  Webbie is to start by using the ""web"" button on the webbie browser (which shows web pages as they appear on a normal browser, with Flash etc included) and then click the ""text"" button once I get where I'm going, which then strips out all the coding and reads all of the text aloud. There are other ways to use webbie - it is entirely possible to navigate solely from the text screen. I've just never fully broken myself of using a mouse!I just tested it out with all my open tabs to make sure it still works as well as the previous version I was using, and it successfully read everything from the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland in the link provided by Prof. Rabkin, to these discussion boards, to a Reddit thread, to a Guardian news article, to another forum with some really wonky discussion board coding, to this very post I'm typing, both letter by letter and word by word ... all with no trouble.It is far from perfect, mind you, but it's a good substitute for the shinier programs like JAWS when you don't have the money to splash out on them.That should get you started if you are interested in Thunder, and the help files included are good - but of course, if you need any further help, I'm happy to assist.;Rebecca - I know that the Germanic Revival movement came before Hitler :) What I'm saying is that the form of nationalism was different, and over the years the folklore was shoehorned into a very different form of nationalism than the Irish. And in the inter-war period as the Irish Republic was forming, and then after WW2, as Germany really struggled with concepts of national identity without falling into nationalism and veered the hell away from folk traditions, the experiences of the Irish in the Republic and Northern Ireland were totally different.  It'd be foolish to imagine that it's the explanation, which isn't what I suggested; but there's something in there, I reckon :)Megan - The storytellers in my Irish family do the same :) Sadly, there was an estrangement between the English and Irish sides - the Irish side being local bigwigs did not approve of marrying into a long line of peasants - so we're only now getting to know each other. And even family stories seem to shift all over the place!Again, is that a difference in culture between German and Irish people that pre-dates the folk revivals, or is it that the Irish were not politically constrained in how they approached the stories? In fact, has the use of folklore in the Irish struggle against British rule actively encouraged a fluid telling to make it appropriate to the moment in time?Like I say, I'm not proposing that I have the answer, just possibly part of an answer.;I had no idea about the board games. Non-violent gaming - actually, non-violent anything in terms of entertainment - is hard to come by, what with the ""myth of redemptive violence"" being so pervasive. WW2 was probably a just as huge a reinforcement of that idea in the UK as it was an incentive to move towards non-violent entertainment in Germany.That was really, really interesting stuff. Thanks :);Oh. My. Word.  This was someone actually paid to teach? And your textbooks actually said that stuff?  My gast has been officially flabbered.Mind you, as a teacher once told me, ""What people BELIEVE about the past is more important than what DID happen."" And an anthropologist friend told me that, ""Changing people's beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell.""  ;To be clear, the ""what people believe"" thing was about recognising the gap between facts and evidence on the one hand and the mythologising of history on the other, and how the emotional resonance of a mythologised past actually go on to create our cultural and political reactions in the future. He was a grand teacher :)I lived in NJ for a good few years, and Other Half's of Irish descent, so I remember the culture shock of St Paddy's. A bit different than the version we get in Manchester, which is itself rather different than in various bits of Ireland... I did have several occasions when Irish-Americans gave me grief about being English, before we established that my Irish ancestry was more recent than theirs. But being Irish or Italian or Greek or any other hyphenated American is obviously going to be quite different than it is in ""the old country"". My attitude was, at first, pretty dismissive. I arrogantly assumed people were claiming an identity they'd no right to. Surely they were Americans, and that was that? I hadn't realised then that identities are complicated things. It took a few humiliating experiences to discover that a lot of my assumptions didn't hold water.That said,  I've never got over the idea of green beer, and I don't think I ever will. Some things are bred in the bone!Your mention of the textbooks reminds me of James Loewen's Lies My Teacher Told Me, which really made me question what unfacts MY teachers had passed on to me.;I enjoy the new shows as much as the old ones.   I especially think the newer ""villains"" are much better.   The Weeping Angels are great and the Silence are pretty good.   One note on the old shows is that the BBC destroyed their copies of many early episodes in the 60's and 70's.   As a result some episodes survive only in audio form.   What a shame!;And for those interested, the results of that project are now available online here: http://www.loc.gov/collection/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/;Yes, the assignment page will count the words and tell you how many you have. In addition to that, the submit button won't be clickable if you go too far over the limit! The thesis is counted in your word limit. (Your thesis also does not have to be the first sentence in your essay, just somewhere in the first paragraph. A good thesis should be recognizable as a thesis no matter where it is.) The references in your works cited are not counted in your word limit - citations go in a separate box that usually doesn't have a word limit at all.Contractions are frowned on in academic papers, but since Coursera is peer graded, nothing is ""not allowed"" on its platform. It is up to our peers to grade appropriately, and I doubt anyone would remove points for contractions. (I have never had anyone in my other Coursera classes remove points for contractions, anyway.)Word counts are a common metric in American academia, especially after the advent of the typewriter/computer. It is a way to ensure that students do not abuse the guidelines for, say, a five page assignment, by putting too many spaces between their paragraphs!;Katarzyna, yes, that's right. You *could* put ""Thesis: Text"" at the top, if you really wanted to, but generally a thesis statement is a concise statement *within* the early part of your essay that tells the reader exactly what you'll be exploring, such as, ""In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers."" If the rest of your essay is about the various ways the tales use stepmothers to warn against jealousy, that would be a good thesis statement, and the reader would be able to pick that out as your thesis, without you having to put ""Thesis: In Grimm's tales, the dangers of jealousy are represented by stepmothers,"" at the top.In fact, a good way to check if your thesis is strong enough is to write your essay and then read it back to yourself and see if all the other statements relate back to your thesis. If they do, then any other reader will be able to figure out your thesis, too.Happy to help. :);Anonymous, the Coursera word counter has frustrated me many a time, and I still haven't quite worked out exactly what counts as one word or two by its metrics! I think you may be right about apostrophes causing words to be counted as two regardless of whether they're used in a contraction or the possessive. It seems like there are one or two other oddities about it, but I haven't figured them out yet.Hyphenated words definitely count as two words. Citations within the text - e.g. (Grimm) or [1] - sometimes count as words, sometimes not. (In previous classes, I could sometimes eke out room for another word by deleting the space between the phrase and the citation... and sometimes that didn't work.) All I can say is, I am eternally grateful for that buffer (usually between 30-100 words) between the ""official"" essay limit and the point where the submission button greys out. I'd never get anything submitted, otherwise!;Anonymous, I am irritated by any word count limit under 2000! I have figured out, though, that the main reason Coursera professors tend to set low limits is because it is our peers who are doing the grading, and they are each expected to evaluate multiple essays. If everyone in the class writes as extensively as I would like to, that is a lot of reading for a peer to do, especially if their written English skills are not good due to a language barrier or a learning disability, or they have difficulty with their sight. (We have students with each of those challenges in this class with us at the moment.)   A student who is mentally or physically fatigued by reading in their non-native language, or by reading print of any kind, will fail to read *carefully* after a little while, and that would unfairly affect the grades of those of us who would like to go on at greater length.Even though I hate it, I am warming to the challenge of trying to express my ideas in such few words. As Prof. Rabkin says, it is helping me crystallize my thoughts.;Emily, I'm just a fellow student, but I thought Prof. Rabkin covered things pretty well in his ""How to Write for this Course"" lecture. If you haven't seen that yet, go check it out, it may help you get to grips with his intentions direct from the horse's mouth.This course, to me, does not appear to be markedly different from even the most basic literature course. Don't let the ""level"" spook you; I would venture to guess you probably *have* done this before, even if you've never written an essay on it - most of us interpret literature without thinking about it. (Dr. Rabkin says this in the videos, too.) Consider ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" It's not just about a literal rabbit and a literal tortoise, is it? The merits of perseverance, the perils of laziness/cockiness, the importance of not counting one's chickens before they hatch, the dangers of being a braggart, the importance of hard work and practice, pride goeth before a fall... all of those themes are potentially in that story. And all of them would make a decent essay. You can probably think of more.Unlike scientific writing, there is no absolute structure involved in a literature essay, because there are no (or at least, few) absolute facts, since literature can be interpreted in many different ways. Prof. Rabkin covered this in the videos, so you can check my breakdown against his instructions if you like, but this is the general summary of how a literature essay works.Pick an idea that says something about the text on a deeper level than what the literal story is. This can be a general theme you've noticed, or it can be found by paying attention to specific words to uncover a ""hidden"" theme, as Prof. Rabkin demonstrates.Develop this idea into a sentence or two that encompasses what you would like to talk about. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil."" becomes ""The evil stepmother symbolizes the importance of the family unit and the fear of outside influences destabilizing family harmony."")This sentence becomes your thesis. Check through the story(-ies) you are analyzing and make sure that your thesis is supportable. (Example: ""Stepmothers are evil because remarriage is a bad idea"" would be a bad thesis. It says nothing about the deeper meaning of the story, and you can't support that thesis with the story text.)If your thesis checks out, write your essay around it. Write sentences that support that thesis statement and examine it in greater detail. When you're finished, read over your essay and make sure that every other sentence in it relates back to your thesis (the thesis itself does not have to be labeled ""thesis"" and can be anywhere near the beginning of your essay. If you have supported your thesis well enough and made sure every statement relates back to it, the reader should be able to spot it without explicit directions).That is as close to a ""formula"" or a ""structure"" as any instructions for a literature essay are ever going to come, I'm afraid. I'm much better at scientific papers than lit papers myself, so I understand your desire for greater structure and clearer instructions, but the reason there aren't any more than what Prof. Rabkin has already given us is because literature is about personal interpretation, and personal interpretation varies as much as people do.;I too am struggling with this - I have one ""outside connection"" in my essay as it stands right now. I will probably leave it in, as it has to do with the time period in which the stories were told, which I think is necessary to make my particular argument complete. I think it's easier to avoid any outside connections with a longer work.... for example, when I wrote a paper on mythology in Fahrenheit 451, there were enough various mythology references for me to deal with in the text itself so as to make expository information about mythology unnecessary. With Grimm, because the stories are so short, one's choice of thesis might easily require a tiny bit of outside contextual reference.I could, of course, just choose a different thesis, and I still might.... but I really like the one I've got.;""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you..."" ;I think about that every time I run a search for something dodgy. Makes me wish there was something standardized that writers could put on our computers along the lines of ""it's just for a novel, I promise!"";Karen, I've seen it, and given what the NSA is doing on US soil these days (though not, it must be said, solely to Americans!) we should all *hope* it's useless!Elise, thanks for my first laugh of the morning! But yes, something *exactly* like that. :);These are all great interpretations! I think there is also something to be said for this story being a ""do not defy the natural order of things"" type of story. Cats and mice are considered to be ""mortal enemies,"" and the cat could not overcome his true nature as a predator. This would have been an important lesson to teach children in the time period in which these stories were told, when the class system was strong and behaving or associating ""above one's station"" was frowned on.It is a theme to some extent echoed in Orwell's Animal Farm - the animals seek to build a utopian society they never could have had with the humans around, only to find themselves echoing the very worst aspects of human nature. In the end, the animals are worse off than where they began. Of course, Orwell was sending a much more complex and ultimately different message than is in the Grimm story - but the message of ""disrupting the natural order of things can have unpleasant consequences"" is the same.;I'm sure it's fine from an academic integrity standpoint (as others have mentioned, previous students in the course have already done so). I would personally be wary of posting a complete draft of an essay on a publicly accessible website *before* the peer review deadline for that essay, though - even if it's just a draft. Not because it violates any academic integrity standards, but because, sad to say, in a course this large, there will always be a few unsavory or desperate individuals who are tempted to plagiarize. The number of individuals tempted to do this tends to drop as the course progresses (because those people drop out).But for myself, I would hate to post a draft of my essay and then have a peer reviewer see two (or more!) copies of that essay and mark me down for potential plagiarism. Since peer reviews are done anonymously on both sides, the reviewer has no way of knowing that the person who wrote one *particular* essay is the same one who posted it online in the first place. This happened in one of my previous courses - a student copied an essay she had authored herself and previously posted online, others found the same essay and copied it too, and the whole lot of them ended up with zeros for plagiarism, because we had no way of proving who the original author was.So, were it me, I would stick to blogging general impressions/reviews of the book and your essay topic, but avoid quoting from that essay or posting any drafts of it until *after* the peer review period. Unless doing so would completely break your blog format, this could even become an ""eagerly awaited"" feature of your blog - as soon as grading closes, your readers get to see the final product!;Remember, though, that The Six Soldiers of Fortune begins with the line, ""There was once a man who was a Jack-of-all-trades; he had served in the war, and had been brave and bold, but at the end of it he was sent about his business, with three farthings and his discharge."" In other words, the soldier is seeking revenge for having been wronged - not looting and pillaging for no particular purpose. In that sense, the Six Soldiers of Fortune might be showing not the *reverse* of Faithful John, but the same general moral - if you serve faithfully, you are entitled to reward.;Oh, absolutely, there are plenty of morally questionable things in the Six Soldiers. For that matter, cutting off the heads of one's children (as in Faithful John) is pretty morally questionable! One of the things I'm coming to appreciate about Grimm's tales is that the more you look at them, the more meanings and interpretations float to the surface.;I was raised in the oral story tradition, where one of the greatest compliments one can get is to be asked to tell a certain rendition again, but repeating a story is considered not possible, because the story varies depending on the audience, the mood, and the very night it is told. As you point out, you can tell the same *general* story, but never the same *exact* story.At the same time though, writing is, I think, beginning to share certain things with the oral tradition that have only been possible since the advent of the internet. It's true that once a story is written, it's less mutable than an oral tale. Consider, though, published books vs. the massive online community devoted to fanfiction about those books. Fanfiction has, in a way, existed for as long as the written word (the temptation to tell a familiar story in one's own way is, I think, universal), but only now can the people who want to ""play"" in an author's world find each other, tell their own stories, find their own stories shaped by others who are playing (sometimes in real time), and so on.Similarly, I've been working on a novel for over a decade now, and I had far too much material to wade through and a difficult time sorting the wheat from the chaff. So I went to a fellow writer and friend of mine, and said, ""I need to play with these characters a bit. You've read some drafts and you know what I do - can you knock together a character and we'll throw them together and just see what happens?""So we did, bouncing dialogue and scenes off each other over various instant messaging programs. Sometimes line by line, sometimes a page or two at a time. I've sorted out my characters now, but my friend and I still play this way a few times a week, just for fun - and although we do copy everything over to a document at the end of the night, and we build on what's come before, the *feel* of what we do is far closer to oral storytelling than writing. Writing is solitary - storytelling is interactive. Writing is considered - storytelling is immediate, improvised, adjusted on the fly. Neither can be replaced by the other; what my friend and I do together, fun as it is, isn't really publishable. We do it for the experience of it all (just like with storytelling). What I do on my own is harder, but it's a better *read*. And I never would have had the experience of written, interactive storytelling without the internet. So, I think the lines between oral storytelling and written stories are beginning to blur.... and for me, that's a fantastic, delightful ride. ;Leonardo, indeed! No matter how much preparation you do as the Dungeon Master, the players will always push you in directions you didn't anticipate, and usually discover entirely new, unplanned stories by doing so.;As someone else who is unemployed and time rich but cash poor, I second the library suggestion. I bought the two books in question used off amazon, but only because this happens to be the only time of year that I have a little bit of money in my ""used books"" fund! If the library is not possible due to lack of transportation (lack of bus fare/gas money/etc), I will simply say this: The internet has everything under the sun, if you look hard enough.(Edited to add: As a writer myself, I hope everyone in this class finds legal means of accessing the material - piracy devalues my own personal craft, and I don't endorse it. As a person of severely limited financial means, though, I know that's not always realistically possible, and since this thread is about accessing the material for *study*, it puts things in a slightly different light. Crystal, I hope you do have the means to get to the library or a nice cozy book shop. If, though, getting transportation to a place like that is a pipe dream because you're struggling just to keep the lights on.... the internet is a vast place.);The syllabus, located here: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseSyllabussays, ""the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886)  which was published by Dover and is available online through Project  Gutenberg.""In other words, if you are using the Lucy Crane translation, you are supposed to read all of those stories. Hope that helps.;When my mother found out she was pregnant with me, the first thing she did was buy dozens of children's books, so I was being read to all the way back in utero. :) When I was two, my mother ended up on total bedrest during her pregnancy with my sister. I could just barely crawl by this time (I have cerebral palsy), so mom was trying to deal with a curious, but nearly immobile, two year old while dad was at work. She figured she might as well teach me to read. I remember loving the process of learning, but hating the circumstances... it was a hot, sweaty Michigan summer with no air conditioning and few fans, with the temperature often exceeding 90F/32C during the day. I wanted to go to Lake Michigan (a 15 minute drive from our home) and cool off, not practice my phonics! I persevered and was reading fluently when my sister was born, just in time for my third birthday.I haven't stopped since. Thanks, Mom.;Karen, first of all, I promise I'm not stalking you! :)But as one who'd also read anything, your last comment reminded me of when I was about six and went through a period of wanting to read a lot of comic books. Not solely comics, mind you. And not ""standard"" comics. I had happened upon comic book adaptations of O. Henry, Dickens, Jack London, Mary Shelley, Mark Twain - classics. And I loved them. But mom was concerned that such a steady diet of comics might be... I don't know. Too low-brow? Rotting my brain? I was her eldest child, so she worried about such things! She went to my teacher, who asked to see what I was reading. When I handed them over, he laughed and told my mother, ""First of all, she's reading comic adaptations of some of the greatest literature ever written - it's hardly all POW and BAM. Secondly, I'm just glad she's *reading*. Let her read the back of the cereal box, who cares?""Mom relaxed a little after that. I still have all those comics... they're still brilliant.;I owe a lot of my adult reading philosophies to my mother, in good ways and bad... I still worry about reading things that are ""low-brow"" (I hid the Harry Potter books for *ages*, until it became socially acceptable for adults to read them!) and my mother will still scoff if she finds ""trash"" on the Kindle (it's technically my Kindle, but I gave it to her so she could read between her school bus routes, since I can access the account from my computer. It's a fine arrangement, as we like to read a lot of the same things - but it does mean I hesitate before acquiring anything I might hear about later!).I too was easily scared as a child (still can't watch horror films), but my mother took the opposite approach - the day I got my library card, she handed over a note to the librarian that said I wasn't to be barred from any part of the library and I wasn't to have any of my selections questioned under any circumstances. The librarian looked at her a bit askance (I was 4, iirc) but agreed to keep it on file. I asked mom why she would bother with such a note, since, at four, I had little desire to venture too far beyond the children's section.She told me that when she was nine, she had tried to check To Kill a Mockingbird out of the very same library, and had been barred from doing so by the head librarian (this being just after it was published, when such a novel was considered to be *highly* subversive). She went home and told her father, who marched up to the library and demanded to know exactly why his daughter was being barred from reading *anything*, because an educated populace was something to celebrate, and surely she wasn't questioning his ability to parent by making decisions about his child's education for him, etc etc. (My grandfather on my mother's side is probably from whence my more revolutionary side comes!) The librarian handed the book over, and my grandfather told my mother, ""I can't give you half what I'd like to... but I'll be damned if I'll ever let anyone tell you what you can *read*. There are some difficult things in this book, and some of them you might not be ready for. You don't have to read them if you don't want to. If you do read them, come to me if you need to talk about them."" He died a few years later. When he did, mom realized that the greatest gift he'd ever given her was the notion that no book is ""bad,"" because books are meant to foster discussion. She vowed to raise her kids the same way.In the main, she succeeded. My greatest worry as a kid (and now!) regarding my reading material is that she'll comment that a book is ""beneath (my) capabilities""... but she never told me not to read anything, or that I ""shouldn't"" read anything. She just prefers I spend my time reading books that make me think.... which does not at all exclude popular modern novels. We both read everything from King to biographies to mystery novels to Plato - I introduced her to the Temeraire series and Harry Potter, she introduced me to Stieg Larsson. Our conversations often begin, ""You *have* to read this!!!""It's not a watertight philosophy, mind you, as she found out when I was about nine and came to her with a Judy Blume book in my hand. ""Mom, the main character keeps talking about something going up. What's he talking about?""To her credit, her reply was, ""Hang on just a minute. I need a cigarette for this conversation!""There were plenty of times I accidentally scared myself silly (John Bellairs ""The Eyes of the Killer Robot"" was the source of not a few nightmares), but my parents were smart enough to turn even those into literary discussions - why is having your eyes taken scary? Why eyes, in particular? It must be said that my father was in no way on board with the ""read anything you like"" plan. He liked his sleep!;Kathleen, that's an interesting question!What inspired me to keep reading... I think part of it was a love of word play. Both of my parents love word play, puns, double entendres, and words that are just plain fun to say, so I was raised with a lot of that. Instead of saying ""Time for dinner,"" my father would announce, ""Time to masticate some comestibles,"" and I had no idea that wasn't how everyone announced a meal was ready until I was well into primary school. :) Some of it was undoubtedly because I was shy (books were friends without that complicated making friends bit), and some of it was because with books, I could go anywhere, regardless of how laid up I might be in real life (four full summers in leg casts from hips to toes). I'm positive some of my ""read everything I can get my hands on immediately if not sooner"" philosophy came out of those miserable summers. I might not have survived with my sanity intact without the library!Having said all that, my sister grew up in the exact same environment - leg casts included, though not as many times - and couldn't possibly care less about books. She's a visual learner and a pictorial thinker (she was stunned to learn I think in *words,* and now thinks anyone who does is *irredeemably* strange) so while she enjoys being read *to* for short periods, she'd really rather watch a video or draw a picture. We're both well into adulthood now, but the pattern was evident from the time we were very small.;I can't decide if the notion of having two of my father in the world would be a good or a bad thing - not sure the planet could handle it!Ah, brain fog. It's slowed my reading significantly, too. First inkling I had that something might be wrong was at uni, when I found myself reading the same page over and over and understanding *nothing*... it felt like I was trying to read a language in which I knew all the words but had no idea how they went together. Turned out to be RA, so now I get brain fog from the RA *and* from the meds used to keep my joints from eating themselves! Reading on a high contrast monitor helps.... sometimes.My sister has autism and a lot of learning difficulties, and finds reading easier if she uses a yellow overlay. On the rare occasions she picks up a book, we can tell she's actually been reading it because it's got a sheet of yellow plastic stuck in.;I am just a fellow student, so my answer is not in any way official. Here is my opinion.Generally, personal feelings are not put into a literature essay. Personal *thoughts* are, that is, your personal view of what the text is trying to say. But not personal feelings, like ""I think these tales are scary,"" or ""these tales scared me as a child.""However, you can discuss your feelings indirectly, by saying something like ""Grimm's tales instill fear in children by dealing with topics such as death, loss, abuse,"" and so on. One of the hardest things for me about writing literary essays is sounding declarative, instead of as though I am only offering my opinion!That said, if I were peer reviewing an essay with personal content in it, I would probably not take points off as long as the personal content related to the thesis statement. It is probably worth asking yoursel"
FALSE,St12,Coh1,3,0,1,1,0.0334979,1,0.6,0,0.3,0.36723165,0,"Sean, on the whole, I completely agree. I have never been heavily into fantasy or sci-fi, but only because I'm a very eclectic reader who will read anything put in front of me (so I'm not really ""heavily"" into *anything*); when I do, though, I am usually impressed and gratified by what I find.It's funny, you're not the first person on this thread who's mentioned that we don't necessarily have to share attributes to relate to the characters or appreciate the story (including appreciating the time period in which it was written and/or set, whether we are comfortable with it or not). I agree with that, too. Lest that be a confusing statement coming from me after all the pontification above, I'll unpack it a little (n.b.: None of this is directed at any one person in particular, just some general observations on my part): I think often when these conversations arise, people who have rarely been bothered by representation in literature have a difficult time understanding the perspective of those who *are* bothered. There's a mistaken impression that we're incapable of enjoying anything that ever hits a misstep, and/or that we go *looking* for things to rant about.Nothing could be further from the truth. If you talk to people who like to discuss problematic representation (or total lack of representation) in the media, or who like to deconstruct attitudes in literature over time, we are usually the most ardent defenders of preserving historical texts as written, and of books/shows we love dearly even when they *are* problematic. Generally, it's the people who try to speak *for* us who want book burnings, whitewashing of texts, and refuse to read/watch/discuss anything that doesn't portray everyone in society as absolutely equal. I think the sanitization of literature is a crime, quite frankly. I read *to feel things*. I would much rather read a good book with some problematic content that upsets me, than read one that the political correctness police have had a go at. It's just that sometimes I get smacked with a prejudice that I wasn't in a good mental place to handle... but that doesn't mean I don't recognize the right of that art to exist. As a corollary to that, I know few people who read *only* fiction involving social minorities. I tend not to associate with those people, because their narrow view of the world doesn't suit me. :) Some of my favorite books in the world have no minorities in them whatsoever; I find other ways in which to identify with them. We are all more than the sum of our parts, and at the end of the day, we're all human.   Good writing trancends all identity labels. Also, as a writer I believe that writing exists to speak truth. Ugly truths are not excepted. Fiction is the mirror humanity holds up to itself, but that mirror is  only engaging and useful if it reflects *some* kind of truth. As a matter of fact, ugly truths are probably the most important ones to address.... almost always, when I find myself having an issue with a *modern* novel/tv show/film, it's because it's addressed an ugly truth *badly*. Most of the time I can find my way to giving an A for effort. Some days, not so much; it's more to do with my own mental state at the time than the actual words. As an example, since you reference Doctor Who (one of three television shows that I have ever watched *religiously*): Recently, I found myself *adoring* The Crimson Horror episode, after years of bitterly complaining about Moffat's showrunning and tinny, problematic scripts. For the first time since The Doctor's Wife, I felt like it was ""my show"" again. By the very end, I was watching through my fingers - not because I was scared, but because I was waiting for Gatiss to ruin the episode for me by giving in to one of the oldest tropes in the book (if you've seen it, you know what I mean... the long, slow closeup on the alien element at the end)... and then he subverted it, with relish. I punched the air in delight.... and trepidation. Waiting for *another* of the oldest tropes in the book... And then he subverted *that*, too. Honest to God, I teared up. There were so many ways that episode could have gone wrong from the perspective of portraying a disabled character, and Gatiss sidestepped them all. Or so I thought. Then I began reading over other people's impressions, and realized I'd completely missed all the instances of ""male gaze"" in the episode (Moffat just can't help himself!) Didn't ruin it a bit for me. (Spoilers!) Sure, it's problematic that The Doctor would grab a woman (and a woman whom he knows is a lesbian) for a very inappropriate kiss. On rewatch, it bothers me a little, simply because it's so unnecessary (likewise the sonic screwdriver gag in the same scene), and it's a cheap laugh that could've been got another, better way.... as played, it feels *grabby* and *intrusive*. (Men often get this wrong, because it plays well in fiction for men to be aggressive and grabby with women, sexual orientation irrelevant. Trouble is, most women have had experiences like that in *real life*, and in real life, being suddenly, nonconsensually grabbed by a man - even a man you know and trust - is scary as hell.) In isolation, the scene is light and maybe amusing, but when you stack it against the other creepy behavior toward women Moffat endorses, it's just ew... especially as Doctor Who is a family show, so there are small children, particularly small boys, who are seeing this and thinking that's how a ""real man"" behaves around women/gets the girl. Like it or not, TV is the biggest shaper of culture, and while no one message will affect a kid, boys get *bombarded* with those messages.... Be aggressive. Grabbing a woman is okay if you're ""just joking."" Grabbing a woman is okay if she doesn't scream or smack you. Women secretly want to be ordered around, dragged around or thrown around, because it's sexy and proves you are masculine. No means yes. If you didn't mean to hurt her/scare her, then she has no right to be upset. Good intentions are enough. The aware guys of the world, which I do think is most of them, quickly come to understand that these messages are bull. But it's a lot of baggage to lay on them and then say, ""Now, don't *ever* act like everyone you see on TV."" It's setting boys (who will one day be men) up to fail, I think, and that's no more fair to the boys than to the girls (who get the opposite damaging messages: Be passive. Don't hurt anyone's feelings. If he didn't mean it, then you're oversensitive to be bothered by it. You have little to no right to your own personal space, especially if the person encroaching on that space is male.) It's little wonder that men and women have such difficulty communicating; we're not from different planets, we just get messages from society that set us up to not communicate!Anyway, to return to The Crimson Horror (spoilers, again): I read a little further in the discussion threads and found, on a feminist blog that claims to celebrate intersectionality (that is, be sensitive to the fact that there are many different types of minorities in the world, and we won't always have the same feelings/needs), the following bit of a post, paraphrased: ""I don't understand why The Doctor didn't just cure Ada at the end of the episode. Surely he has the technology. His cruelness in leaving her blind was shocking. She'll never amount to anything trying to function like that in Victorian society. She saved him and that's how he repays her?"" I still haven't responded to that comment, and I probably won't. Besides demonstrating that just because one is a social minority, it doesn't make one immune to saying incredibly hurtful and ignorant things, it hammered home the idea that we have a long way to go - intersectionality is a great buzz word, but right now, it's still mostly a buzz word. Trying to explain the problems with that comment to a non-disabled person is often quite literally like trying to describe colors to a person who has never been able to see, and weeks later, I'm still not up for trying to explain to that (I'm sure, very well-meaning) person exactly why her comment is deeply offensive, and then, no doubt, end up in a poo-flinging match about why it's okay for a *blind* person to say something like that, but not a sighted person. (Why? Because life's not fair, that's why. Just like I can and do call myself a cripple and a gimp, but if an ablebodied person does so, they are quite likely to find their ankles clipped by my front casters.)As usual, I digress. You are entirely correct that fantasy and sci-fi often get it right more than they get it wrong, and also that portrayal of minorities (or two-hearted Time Lords!) should never sacrifice story just to make a point about diversity.   When writers do that, they come across as lecturing, and it's not pretty. I actually don't find it hard to avoid minority issues eating the plot at *all*, but then, I've been doing it all my life. I'm sure it's harder for people who are less aware of minority points of view. Really, though, no one expects everyone to know everything - we can each only write from our own experiences and interests - but avoiding being preachy or worse, desperately wrong/offensive is easily solved by simply *asking* someone of the minority you're trying to portray - preferably *before* your writing is finalized!I am deeply ambivalent about Flowers for Algernon. It's an important book, no doubt, and a good one, and I'm glad it's out there. I still have my copy. But I have to be in the right mood to read it, because as with a lot of fiction that tries to tackle disability but is written by a non-disabled author, the ""got it just right"" bits are a thrill and the missteps are glaring. (My sister functions at a level similar to Charlie's ""natural"" state, so she and I have had many discussions about it.);Funny you should mention that. I was going to bring up the whole ""besides, the Doctor is asexual!"" thing, but I never know how people will react! Ten is ""my Doctor,"" but even speaking from that perspective, I found his relationship with Rose... I don't know. Strange? Out of character? Inexplicable? None of which was anything to do with *Rose*, whom I liked on the whole. It just seemed bizarre to me that a man as old as the Doctor, who has experienced things many orders of magnitude beyond what any human could ever experience (even human assistants/companions), would fall in love with a human in the *way* that he was depicted to have done with Rose. RTD's explanation for it is rather brilliant, though, I admit... he says that due to the circumstances surrounding the regeneration, the Doctor sort of *imprinted* on Rose, like a chick from an egg (thus the similar accents!) I still don't *like* it, but that makes the whole Ten/Rose thing make more sense to me (imo, Nine/Rose was a lot more one-sided... Ten/Rose was when the Doctor started to reciprocate in a more-than-platonic way.) Of course, Moffat then took the imprinting idea to openly creepy territory, but that's a whole other rant.I think the next Doctor will be male, too. I'm okay with that. Actually, I'm hoping and praying we'll get Ben Daniels. He's not an extra young fella, but he's easily passed for a mid-30s ""look"" in other recent shows he's done. Don't even get me started on River.... *so* much potential at introduction, and then it's all flushed down the bog! River is a perfect example of how all of Moffat's female characters have their agency ripped away from them in favor of their entire lives revolving around the Doctor. He did it with Reinette, then Sally Sparrow, then River, then Amy, now Clara. Every one of them ends up trapped in a timey-wimey situation where their actions are predestined. The first few times, it was an interesting idea. At this point, I just roll my eyes. Another woman, another cookie-cutter ""feisty girl"" who lives solely to serve The Doctor and his ends.Doctor Who is never off topic, to my mind... certainly not in a class like this!;Faith, that's a good point. Part of the reason Ten is ""my"" Doctor, even though I've seen them all, is because I find Ten's emotional range so fascinating... I know some people think Tennant chewed the scenery, but I loved that he could go from cheeky to despondent to having a geeky moment to coldly furious all in the same episode. From that point of view, it does make sense that a Doctor who feels things so deeply would also fall in love.... and since Rose was the catalyst for that regeneration (in crude terms, the woman who ""taught him how to feel again,"") it also makes sense that he would fall in love with her. Thanks for that.A lot (not all, but I'd say 50% or so) of the ""but the Doctor is asexual!"" comments I see do in fact come *from* asexual fans, who aren't so much upset with Who as they are crying out for representation; they feel like putting the Doctor in the ""sexual"" box has just ripped away one of the characters they can most relate to. (Moffat's snarky comments about asexuality being ""boring"" don't help on that front.) As one who identified as asexual for many years (cause I sure as hell wasn't a straight woman, and I wasn't a lesbian, and I didn't know what that left other than asexual, because *nobody*, including me, was going to touch me *anywhere* if I could help it - gender dysphoria is a barrel of fun, especially when you have no idea what it is!), I can sympathize with their point.I like Clara and River too, they both just make me so *sad* with what Moffat's done to them... River had bucketloads of personality (love her or hate her, no one's ambivalent!) and then it turned out none of that *personality* even belonged to her, let alone the events of her life... and poor Clara was written from the start as a plot device, a tabula rosa to fulfill Moffat's ""brilliant"" storyline. It's such a shame.I'm in favor of such a class; as long as we're not unraveling the base code of the universe, which was the first thought that came to mind when you said that! :);Moffat has been a festering turd re: bisexuality, too. He said that River is bisexual on his Twitter, and a fan commented along the lines of ""er, how were we supposed to know that, exactly?"" and he went off on this rant about how it wasn't his responsibility to include diverse characters (except for the LOLs), and besides, bisexual people were probably too busy shagging to watch Who anyway, so anyone that's bothered should shut up. The whole brouhaha made me glad that, while Moffat may have been the one to ""invent"" Jack, RTD was the one *shaping* Jack's character... because RTD got it right, on the whole. As you say, not perfect, but Jack is well rounded, interesting, and bisexuality is only *one* part of his character... that one trait doesn't swallow all the other things Jack is. And when you can get that *balance* right, you can go for the cheap joke once in a while.RTD's work is quite interesting from a sexuality perspective because he threw a concept into sharp relief in Queer as Folk (he was the original author, as QaF started in the UK). Stuart Jones (Brian Kinney in the US version) is selfish, vain, abusive, and sex obsessed (at least in the beginning). He uses drugs, parties all night, doesn't believe in relationships, and has sex with every guy he can get his hands on. In short, he's every possible stereotype about gay men that the straight world has, all rolled into one character. Thing is, everyone who moves in LGBTQ circles *knows someone* like that! (Ugly truth being reflected.) So why does it ""work,"" instead of coming off as an offensive stereotype? Two reasons: One, Stuart/Brian experiences character growth, which gives him a *depth* of character. Two, he's not *the* gay character in the show.... so he is not held up as ""absolute truth,"" just one uncomfortable example of it. In QaF, RTD achieved that well-roundedness by showing *more than one example* of what it means to be a gay man, both amongst the cast and through character development. And that's why *more* representation is the key to the whole problem. The more women and minority characters we get in our fiction, the broader the overall portrait becomes, and then it's not necessarily jarring or offensive to have a stereotypical minority character, because there are other examples (preferably in the same work, or at least the same universe). When a white straight man acts stereotypically, no one comes away from that thinking ""all white straight men behave that way."" But when a minority character acts stereotypically, most of the audience will accept that as the only way that character could possibly have been written, because they think ""all"" people of that minority *do* behave in that way... unless the author gives them some other example to counter the stereotype.So it's not that no one can ever write a stereotypical minority character... it's that if you're going to do that responsibly, you need to have counterexamples. And if you don't want to bother with counterexamples, but you want to write responsibly, then you need to be careful to avoid the stereotype.;Yes he does. And I agree - RTD (and John Barrowman) got the ""tone"" around Jack's character exactly right... which is why it's funny. Tone is a funny thing when it comes to writing... it can swing your point from valid to ridiculous or humorous to offensive in one fell swoop. I don't think it's a coincidence that the tone was right and Jack was played by a gay actor and the bulk of his character written by a gay writer. It's not that a straight actor and a straight writer *couldn't* have nailed the tone, or that being gay and being bisexual are equivalent - but sexual minorities generally *inherently* understand the subtleties of tone regarding sexual minorities as a whole, whereas straight writers/actors have to do some mental gymnastics (and probably some checking-with-people-of-that-minority) to understand how to strike the right tone. It's the same with disability - none of my current characters actually have *my* disability, or anything remotely like it. But because I'm ""culturally disabled"" (in the same way that one can be ""culturally Jewish"" - that is, culturally aware of what it's like to be disabled, the importance of my tone, and how to hit the emotions I'm going for vis-a-vis disability), when I ran my writing past those who *do* have the same disability as the characters, they replied, ""What are you checking with *me* for? This is fine."" Hitting the right tone required no massive effort on my part, even regarding a completely different disability, because I ""speak the language"" in both a specific sense (my personal disabilities) and a broader sense (navigating the world as a disabled person in general). That ability is the same reason I can watch something Marlee Matlin is in and know instantly whether the director/writer consulted with *her* regarding portrayal of a Deaf person, or whether they thought they knew better than she does. I'm not Deaf, but being disabled gives me an innate ""feel"" for tone in that area. It's not impossible to make mistakes (which is why it's still important to check!), but it's always easier to hit the right tone when your experiences give you an innate sense of the tone you're aiming for, and what to avoid.I think your examples of bigotry were spot on, no worries. And Stuart/Brian is my favorite character, too. In the end, he was the character with the *most* depth, I think!I agree, too, that a female doctor would be brilliant, but Moffat is *not* the one to tackle it. He has only one way he thinks of women, and a giant chip on his shoulder about how ""men get no respect"" - which, I'm sure, is why he's so lousy at writing women. When you approach writing about something outside your realm of experience with disdain or resentment, it's not going to go well. I liked how Neil Gaiman referenced the possibility of fluid genders within regenerations (the Corsair in The Doctor's Wife), but I think it needs to stay there until Moffat's out, and preferably, until they have more female writers on staff. Right now, that number is zero, and it shows. (RTD didn't do much better on that score, it must be said - under him, there was *one* female Who writer.);I have always loved the Alice stories, though, as a child, I did not care for Alice herself! I remember wishing she would be a little more agreeable and thoughtful towards all of the other characters and their delightful word play. Reading it again as an adult, I am struck by the realization that Alice herself certainly likes wordplay, but she seems to only recognize it as such when *she* is engaging in it. When the other characters play with words in return, she is vexed, puzzled, and irritated.On that note, I wonder how the wordplay translates to the non-native English speakers in this class - is it fun to discover new meanings, or do all the shifting meanings make it difficult to figure out what the characters are saying?;Certainly, I think it would be a fascinating thread of its own! Go ahead. :)I think it was the wordplay itself - both the shifting meanings, and the fact that many of the poems are fun to recite. For lack of a better way to describe it, the words *feel* good... I used to spend hours rolling them around on my tongue and in my head, contemplating how many ways one could say them and how each different way one said them might have a different meaning. (It is probably no surprise that I became a writer!) I love many of the ideas around words in the books - how the same word can mean different things, how one's choice of words matters, how words can bring ideas (and sometimes entire things!) into existence or wipe them away. The Alice stories are paradise for anyone who likes to play with the English language or think about the importance of all languages.;Agreed. Jane Yolen is also the *master* at modern retellings of fairy tales! She knows of which she speaks.;I would not want the job of trying to translate either of the Alice stories into another language. Both books are heavily dependent on wordplay, specifically *English* wordplay. All languages *have* wordplay, enjoy the concept, and engage in it, but not using the same words. Trying to find *one* word in any other language that has the *same* double/triple/quadruple etc meaning as its English equivalent would be a difficult task... trying to find *lots* of different words, all of which have the same multiple meanings to their respective English equivalent, strikes me as nigh impossible.I've read ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in both English and Irish - they feel like very different books, even though the story is the same and there is little wordplay. Because any given translated word will have slightly different connotations from the word in the original language, translating a book can completely alter the *feel* of it... even when it is a very good translation (as I would argue the Harry Potter Irish translation is). I can only imagine how skilled any translator would need to be to even *contemplate* translating Lewis Carroll... and surely, the meanings of bits like Jabberwocky are quite literally lost in translation, as they are entirely made of portmanteau *English* words.I suspect that is why it would be very easy to find the Alice stories ""boring"" in any other language. I have read certain Chinese tales and found them dull or incomprehensible despite good translations - only to realize that the layer I was missing was all the wordplay that works perfectly well in Mandarin, but for which there simply *is* no equivalent in English - at least, not without pages and pages of annotation to ""explain the joke!"";Anonymous, keep in mind that peer reviews are assigned randomly for each essay. By ""tightening"" your grading, you will quite likely end up punishing people who had nothing to do with the first round of reviews you got. I understand that you are hurt and I understand why, but because there is no easy way to converse directly with the people who actually give out unfair grades, it may be best to continue treating others as you yourself would like to be treated.I checked those spelling and grammar check sites out too, and was told I had 30+ ""critical"" errors... my writing is hardly without fault, but it's worth noting that I'm a writer by profession, have been published, and have been writing in English, my native tongue, for 28 years. In short, two or three errors, I could believe... 30+ ""critical"" errors in 320 words, I would have noticed! I'm fairly sure my peers would have too, and I got a 4.5. I don't know what those sites are calibrated toward (the suggestion of junior high, students age 11-14, sounds about right - or maybe very simple sentences for businesspeople traveling abroad), but many of the corrections they suggest are simply not correct at all, especially regarding things like subject-verb agreement. I suspect they are more of a hindrance than a help when it comes to a class such as this.I can understand how that might make you feel not sure what to trust or what resources to use. However, I'm equally sure that I'm not the only fellow student who would be willing to proofread your work and offer suggestions... this is a big class, rich in *human* resources!There is a Facebook group for this class here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/246393752160589Should you choose to join it, I'm sure you can find some fellow students who would be happy to help you out - I would be one of those people.;You have 24 pigs and 4 corrals (or pens, or boxes, or fenced in areas, whatever you like). The four pens are arranged along a circular path. Arrange the pigs in the pens so that if you walk from the first pen, to the second, to the third, to the fourth, and back around to the first, the number of pigs in the pen you are walking toward will always be nearer to ten than the one you are leaving.A little hint: Because this is a puzzle from Lewis Carroll, the solution is not purely mathematical - there is some wordplay involved. So, think about the wording of the question itself.;Sorry that happened to you, Andrew. Utterly unwarranted, as others have said. I distrust plagiarism checkers on the whole, because they tend to have a difficult time discerning a legitimately cited quotation from actual plagiarizing; they can be a good *tool* if you've been trained how to use a particular one, but using one is not as simple as pasting in the material and anything over 5-10% gets automatically called plagiarism. As with a lot of automation, a human has to check over what the computer came up with and make some intelligent decisions about the data.I was in a coursera class where plagiarism - quite blatant plagiarism, with 1000 word blocks of text lifted directly from a single website - was a big issue. We were specifically instructed to grade on content, and not form, grammar, spelling or syntax, because it was a public health class and no one (including those of us with good written English skills) wanted the non-native speakers to be at any more of a disadvantage than they would already be by taking a course in their non-native tongue. We were also given two weeks to write each essay, so the ""limited time"" issue wouldn't be so much of a barrier. In other words, the incentive to plagiarize should have been low. Yet, by the fifth round of essays, it was still going on (I saw several such essays with my own eyes)... very frustrating for the people who did the work. And, of course, there were the false plagiarism accusations, too.With that under my belt, the tack I choose to take is this   - I don't even bring it up unless I am *positive*. And by positive, I mean I can say, ""this section is plagiarized from this site (link) and this section is from this site (link), and you added little/no content of your own."" Yeah, that means some people probably slip by me. I won't say that doesn't bother me, but it would bother me a whole lot more to falsely accuse someone of plagiarism.Consider, too, that since this is an online class, the most likely way for a student to plagiarize is by using google.... which means if they copied large chunks of text, you can find them the same way the peer found the essay in the first place.   If an essay really looks ""too good to be true"", googling a few lines should be sufficient to give you an idea.But please, please be careful about assuming that just because someone writes well, they must not have written it themselves. Taking *that* attitude just punishes the best writers in the class, whom we should want to learn from!;Stephanie, oh my god, you're *right*! Totally missed the Disraeli/Gladstone reference, and now that you've pointed it out, I don't see how anyone who knows that particular bit of history could *possibly* miss it! Brilliant - thanks.;My favorite is still ""Because Poe wrote on both."" It is certainly not an answer that would be given by the Wonderland characters, but it has the same sense of playful-but-somewhat deep wordplay that Carroll so enjoyed.;Suzanne, it's funny how bringing different personal experiences to the readings can result in entirely different ""take away"" messages, even when two people have similar personalities. Like you, I am a very sensitive person. I can't watch horror. I have to be very very careful what kind of horror I *read*, and what time of day I read it (I love Stephen King, but only in the daytime, and I still haven't made it all the way through some of his darker stuff like ""The Shining."") I can't even handle ""funny"" horror like the Scary Movie series, cause it just scares me witless. I read a lot of historical literature, historical accounts, and lightly fictionalized historical accounts, some of which are a million times worse than anything King could come up with, but with those, I've always overcome my tendency to freak myself out by reminding myself that I have a responsibility to know what has come before me in the world (that's just my take, because my parents very much raised me that way. We're a little eccentric.)But A Modest Proposal made me *cry* with laughter. Not because I think eating babies is funny, but because as a life long student of Irish history, I find Swift's piece to be one of the most snarky, dripping-with sarcasm pieces of satire ever written. It reads as a howling protest, a thumbing of the nose, a ""You bloody tyrants want us wiped off the map, eh? (true, at the time!) I bet your next proposal will be *this*!"" And yet for all its scathing critique, it is of course delivered in (mostly) Parliament-appropriate language, heaped with a ridiculous amount of decorum, and you can just imagine it *actually* being a speech given at the House of Lords vis-a-vis ""The Irish Problem"".It wasn't, of course. But the things happening in that time period made you wonder if maybe, someday...Swift meant for A Modest Proposal to be *read* as a scathing critique of the British government's treatment of Ireland in his time. Unfortunately, he wrote such a good, over the top, pointed, erudite piece of satire, that even then, most people read it as comedy rather than political message.I can see how, devoid of the context in which it was written, A Modest Proposal looks like the macabre fantasies of someone who isn't in his right mind. *Within* context, though, the meaning becomes something altogether different.;The Stand is probably my favorite King book (""On Writing"" excepted, since that's more a biography/writing advice book, albeit one of the best on the market, imo). Closely following that are In the Eyes of the Dragon, Rose Madder, and 11/22/63. I find it interesting that King himself never thought much of Rose Madder... while there are some gory bits, to me, it's one of the best anti-domestic violence novels out there.On Writing is absolutely fantastic for anyone who thinks they even might like to write some day. You don't have to like King's work to find it extraordinarily useful and very refreshing in its approach. Rather than droning on for pages about vocabulary, he simply says, use your own vocabulary, whatever it may be. By all means, expand your vocabulary, enjoy words, but when you're actually sitting down to write: ""One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes.""Then there's this gem, regarding Strunk and White. After praising the manual highly, he adds, ""{Strunk and White have} ideas about where it's best to place the most important parts of a sentence. They say at the end, and everyone's entitled to "
FALSE,St12,Coh1,4,0,1,1,0.0348189,0.876717895,0.5,0,0.25,0.42768275,0,"Rebecca, if I recall correctly, Stephen King deconstructs that statement quite a bit in his memoir/writing advice book (it's called ""On Writing,"" and if you haven't read it, it's worth a look!). He provides lots of tips and tricks that have worked for him, but in the end, the main takeaway from his book is, ""Write however *you* write. As long as you know the rules, you can break the rules. There is no right or wrong way to craft a story, unless you're not being true to your own 'voice'."";Rebecca, yes, completely agreed. I think in this particular course, taking into consideration the wide range of experience (and English proficiency) of our peers, having an explicit statement is vital. A skilled writer can have an implied statement when the exact audience and purpose of the writer is relatively uniform.... that is, if a skilled writer is writing for an audience of equally skilled readers, concerning a topic that both groups are invested in. That's not necessarily the case here - our backgrounds, experience levels, and comfort levels with the written English language vary widely. Our audience and purpose is to write insightfully for the attentive, intelligent reader.... and that's it. Given that, we can't make assumptions about any *further* things our audience is bringing to the table, other than being attentive, intelligent, and looking for insight. It's only fair to include an explicit thesis, to give *all* of our peers something to hang their hats on, so to speak. There are a few different benefits to having an explicit thesis in a class like this.1) If the person writing the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis can make it easier to understand what they are trying to say, despite potential grammar errors. I try to give non-native speakers the benefit of the doubt in any way I can, and if they have an explicit thesis, I can usually ""decode"" the rest; making it more likely that I will score them highly. If I can't understand what they are trying to explore, I can't be enlightened or have my reading enriched! Clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.2) If the person *reading* the essay is not 100% confident in their written English skills, having an explicit thesis makes it easier for the peer evaluator to understand what the writer is discussing. The end result is the same no matter which side the English deficit (or tiredness of the reader/writer, or rush of the reader/writer) is on - clear, explicit thesis = easier to understand and evaluate.3) Whether you have an explicit or an implicit thesis, it's very difficult to formulate a thesis if it's not explicit in your own *head*. That being the case, and the word limit and diversity of the audience being what it is, it's probably best to express the thesis in its clearest, most explicit form.... since you (general you) should have that in your head, anyway.;For Grimm, I put two hours' time into 5 reviews, and most of that was typing feedback. For Alice, it was only an hour or so of typing (I was ill, meant to come back and add more suggestions/examples, and ran out of time). But I try to put at *least* fifteen minutes into every essay, not counting reading time. The way I see it, it's one of the most important aspects of class. If I'm criticizing something, I owe it to that peer to provide specifics and examples for how they can do better. If I'm praising something, I owe it to them to be specific about what I'm praising and why. And every peer deserves at least one bit of criticism and one bit of praise for form, and the same for content. It's the only kind of feedback we're going to get from this course, so the least I can do is to try to make sure my feedback is thoughtful, helpful, concrete, and of good quality.I'm not necessarily *limiting* myself to five reviews, by the way.... but so far, I haven't had time to give more than five essays the attention they deserve. I hope to have the time to go above the mandatory five at least a few times over the course of this class.;Oh, and by the way, Agamemnon, you've got a superfluous apostrophe in your thread title. Just in case that was another test. ;)Nice username, though.;Anonymous, NBC and MSNBC have been doing a pretty good job of covering it in the past day or two. It's no doubt they're late to the game, as usual (BBC World News and The Guardian newspaper online have been reporting on it daily for several days now), but NBC and MSNBC have caught up enough to start a) covering it, b) showing footage of it and c) analyzing it, at least a little bit. I wouldn't dare to claim that I have anything close to a comprehensive knowledge of what's going on from my position in the US, but I was aware of the protests, the general causes of the protests, the police reaction, and the reporter Peter mentioned.;Only two things make me consider a 1:1) If, despite reading the essay several times, I can't understand what the writer is trying to say at *all*.   I am a very patient evaluator - I will point out flaws in grammar or punctuation, and provide corrections, but I won't mark down for them unless they make it difficult to read the essay. Similarly, if I can figure out what you're *trying* to say, I will base your content grade entirely on that - not on how well you phrased it. After all, our purpose is supposed to be to enrich each other's reading - if you do that, you get a 2 or a 3 from me. But if I can't understand you at all, then you can't enrich my reading. I understand that not everyone has fluent English-speakers available to look over their essays, but if you know you need a little help expressing yourself, reach out! If you don't know any English speakers in real life, there are many of them in this course. I am one of the many students who is more than happy to help. I won't write your essay for you, but I'll help you find the English equivalent for what you'd like to say. There are also many language specific threads on these boards... ask there, if you'd prefer, and see if your fellow multilingual students can help. :)2) If, after going over the essay several times, I still can't identify what your topic/thesis is. It's entirely possible to write an essay in perfect English, but not really *say* anything. Try to pick a specific topic for your thesis - one that says something interesting about the book. Provide a few examples of this one particular interesting idea in the book,   discuss those examples to help you make that point, and then add a brief conclusion. Read over your essay once you've finished it, and make sure you're not straying off into completely different topics. You don't have room to wander! The higher the number of *different* topics you discuss, the harder it is for an evaluator to figure out which one is your thesis.;Exactly. Home Rule and its consequences is a very, very, *very* complicated subject that encompasses history, religion, economics, socioeconomics, politics, and more. There is a reason that The Troubles are referred to even now with capital letters and in the present tense, 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement. It's all way outside the scope of this discussion, and I don't want to bore anyone, so I'll leave it there, except to say this: If you think it is, or ever was, as simple as Protestant vs. Catholic or Irish vs. British, or if you think it's all a historical conflict, not at all relevant to the modern world........ well, I'm not Northern Irish or British, so I don't have the right to speak for those who are.... but there are many, many, many lost lives, on *all* sides, over many years, who would have given *anything* for the situation to be that simple. And though *I* am not Northern Irish or British, some of those lost lives have belonged to friends of mine - people lost in *my* lifetime to that conflict... friends of mine on *all* sides. Some were lost or maimed before the internet, when all we had was 5 seconds of shaky footage on CNN to try to frantically identify familiar faces under the blood, and 20 hours to wait for the police to allow phone calls through again... sitting up till 3am waiting for the phone to ring, waiting to find out if we could exhale. Wondering which would be worse, the death of one of my friends my own age, or the death of one of their parents. (All deaths, of course, have been equally horrific, but those are the kinds of morbid ruminations that cross your mind when your family is silently huddled on the couch in the dead of night, thousands of miles away, wondering just how bad this night will end.... all the while knowing that even if *you* and *your* friends and loved ones are spared, someone else in the world - usually several someones, sometimes dozens of someones - are mourning theirs.)And some have been lost or maimed after the internet, the news trickling in through sudden text messages, some heartstoppingly vague - ""bomb again..."" I learned to type ""Where? Is everyone alright?"" in a matter of seconds with only my thumbs. And then wait that same wait, shorter now, but still with my heart in my shoes, waiting for the rest.And you can only go through so many years of that before you no longer remember how to exhale. Not all the way. Not quite. The whole mad business no longer has ""sides"" when you reach that point, and life becomes an eternity of the calm before the storm. If you're lucky, when we're all lucky, it stays that way... for a little while. In your gut, you know there will more than likely be a next time.And that's the perspective of someone who is only, and has only ever been, on the outermost fringes of the experience.Like I said - it's complicated.Whatever Stoker's religion, he was an Irishman living in London. In his time, that was a *deeply* alienating experience. Depending on exactly where you're from and exactly where you go, that can still be true today (as can the reverse)... for the same core reasons, and due to the same old wounds that are not nearly as old as they seem.;I think as long as you are making a solid argument about *one* clear idea, you can write about whatever you want and get a good grade. I've had a few comments along those lines too, and the way they're usually phrased is, ""I would have liked to hear more about ____, but I understand we're all working under a tight word limit."" If that's the kind of comment you're seeing, take it as a compliment; you have ""hooked"" the reader, and they're interested in hearing more!If, on the other hand, the kind of comment you're getting is, ""I would have liked to have heard more about _____ instead of (second topic you strayed into,)"" that is a gentle nudge from your peers that perhaps you could have written an essay that was more focused on your thesis. Under such a limited word count, we have to be very careful to make sure we're discussing *one* idea in depth. If you discuss even *two* different ideas in your essay - even if they seem closely related to you - you simply won't have the room to explore either of them in a meaningful way.;Anonymous, you're welcome.That's a difficult question. I might be able to give you a better answer if I knew what your thesis was, and which facts you used - because it depends how closely your facts were related to your thesis.For example, let's say you wrote about the depiction of childhood in Alice, and you said that portrait of childhood was represented by wordplay, Alice's emotional growth, and the structure of the story itself (Alice's evolution from child to Queen). That would be a very good thesis for a paper that is a page or two long, but it's too much to cover in 270-320 words. In a situation like that, I would narrow the thesis to *one* of those things, and make my thesis:""Carroll depicts the magical aspects of childhood through his vivid wordplay."" OR""Carroll explores childhood development through the emotional growth of Alice.""OR""Carroll uses Alice's evolution from child to Queen as an allegory for every child's journey to adulthood.""Basically, make sure you're not trying to cover too much in your thesis for the length you have available to you.It's also worth noting that there's no pleasing certain peer evaluators, so the best you can do is write what *you* think is a solid essay. :);Unfortunately, it doesn't really get better from that perspective. When I was studying Frankenstein in school, I found solace in focusing on the monster more than Victor. He is an infinitely more sympathetic character, in my mind.;Sean, I had a feeling if I didn't post about this passage, you might be the one who would! I guffawed. I'm not sure of the meaning of ""polyglot"" in this scene either - like you, I can guess, but I get the feeling I'm missing another pun. All of that said, this passage has finally solidified into a decent thesis for my essay, after *days* of trying to find a topic to which I can do justice. Now I just have to *write* the thing... with blood!;Rebecca, that's the dictionary definition of polyglot, of course, but I wondered if Van Helsing's *meaning* might be slightly different. I like Sean's guess - that the captain swore in a way that Van Helsing couldn't translate and/or understand (even if it was in English). That would point to a certain self-awareness in Van Helsing's character that we've seen elsewhere in the book... he would essentially be saying, ""The captain said many other things, and I could infer from his tone that he was swearing, but I couldn't make heads or tails of what language the swearing might have been in - it could have been languages with which I'm not familiar, or possibly he descended so far into slang/dialect that I couldn't follow."" There is a third interpretation, but it's what I've built my thesis around, so I'll post about it after the essay deadline. :);I agree, the dialects are theatrically overwritten, and as many have pointed out, often incorrect to boot. But I think Stoker was aiming at something altogether different in this *particular* passage... I may post my essay on this thread after the review period, for further consideration.;Coming here to voice a general complaint that 320 words is not enough to lay out a good persuasive paper on this thesis topic. Sigh. Oh well. It's not as eloquent as it was at 500 words, but hopefully it's still interesting.;I think every writer will have a different answer to your question. Here is mine:I have always struggled with deep literary analysis; it does not come naturally to me. As you say, I can analyze intuitively, on a general level, but actually deconstructing the text line by line to find other/greater meaning has always felt, to me, almost like unmaking a beautiful quilt. When done, I might have a greater appreciation for the stitching, but I no longer have a nice quilt - instead, I have a pile of beautiful pieces, each interesting in their own way, but no longer *complete*.However, I've been writing creatively since the age of four (I'm 31 now). I write for hours a day, every day; it's my greatest love. And indeed, I write intuitively. When I *re-write*, though, I often go back, look through what I've written, and try to subtly enhance any themes or symbolism which inadvertently made it into my creative flow. I make sure to do so in a way that doesn't ""break"" the story... they're just small elements that a reader can find if they're so inclined. If not, they still have a good story to read.I'm finding my literary analysis skills improving as we move through this course, and the short word limit is helping me crystallize complex thoughts in fewer words than I normally would. Whether that will show in my future creative writing, I'm not sure. Certainly, previous literature courses haven't inclined me to write more obviously or intricately symbolic books... so far, that's just not my style.But I do think a course like this helps writers think about why they write what they write, and how best to say what they want to say. It's not that one necessarily needs to answer the first question (it's perfectly okay for the answer to be ""because that's what I like""), but sometimes pondering those things can lead to interesting flashes of insight. It's always valuable to think about one's craft, even if it doesn't affect what you do or how you do it.;Again, this is just my own personal answer; I often find that analyzing a story so deeply *does* take some of the magic out of it for me. Interestingly, though, it seems to have happened less in this course, and I just put my finger on why this morning.In most ""formal"" literature courses, students are asked to write very long essays, and rarely get to hear the ideas of others (apart from the professor/teacher's interpretations, and perhaps those of other official scholars whose work the student cites). So, the combination of having to write a very long paper examining several different disparate elements, and the limited amount of input in terms of others' views, results in a sort of creative exhaustion regarding the book - at least, for me. I very much feel that way about Frankenstein. Having written a 15 page paper on it 15 years ago, I have less-than-zero desire to ever pick it up again - it is a pile of pieces to me, no longer an interesting story.In this course, however, we are limited to choosing one small aspect of the work, making a brief argument, and then we move on. Additionally, we get to see the brief insights our classmates also have, which are often different to our own, or touch on things we hadn't considered. And, because we are not subjected to any ""official"" interpretation by the professor until after we have written our own, we are free to explore as we will. The cumulative effect of all these small differences, to me, is that I'm not creatively exhausted by trying to analyze the book (because I've had to choose only one aspect and provide only a few examples), and reading my fellow classmates' broad range of insights often helps me ""re-quilt"" the book, while still appreciating it in new ways. So, yes, analyzing a book can ruin the experience of the book itself... but I think doing ""bite-sized"" analyses and having the opportunity to see a variety of other bite-sized analyses helps retain the magic of the original experience.As to a recommended way for authors to analyze stories... I don't think there is one. Because I'm an intuitive writer, I tend to analyze intuitively, too... and mostly subconsciously, at that. If a book touches me as a creative masterwork first - if, in other words, it tells me a good story - then I'll often find myself ruminating on what made it good, just in terms of a general statement that I can file away for future reference. Sometimes it's a structural/stylistic reason, like ""the author writes dialogue that rings in my ears for days,"" and sometimes it's an emotional reason, like ""I related to that character, even if I'm not sure why (and I might think about that further to try to uncover the why)"" and sometimes it's due to a bit of symbolism that I subconsciously latched onto that resonates with me. A *really* good book will do all three. An example of one of those, for me, is a book called Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle. It's about a ten year old Dubliner coming of age in the 80s... and that's about it. There is nothing deeply symbolic about it, but it paints a vivid portrait of childhood that uses language that is true to life (i.e. the language used in the book is the language a ten year old boy from Dublin Ireland would use - a structural/stylistic choice that helps the story work), I related to the characters (as a person raised in the ex-pat Irish community, Paddy's parents and friends reminded me of my parents and my friends - an emotional reason the story worked for me), and, in the end, it is a ""loss of innocence"" story, but it's unique in that that loss of innocence is not presented as dark or sad or tragic... you close the book feeling that Paddy is changed, but that a slightly older, slightly wiser Paddy will go on to discover more exciting things about the world (both a structural/stylistic choice - the presentation of the theme as a positive element - and a symbolism choice, the loss of innocence itself). And having done that brief analysis just here and now, it's still one of my favorite books. Undoubtedly, if I tore it apart line by line, I could find more... but I have no desire to end up with a pile of pieces. :);""When we attempt to answer them as well, we end up with self-indulgent, heavy-handed monstrosities like Atlas Shrugged. :P""I literally laughed out loud. You've hit the nail on the head in more ways than one!I'm torn about Frankenstein at the moment - I loved it when I first read it, but writing that paper on it sucked every bit of life from the book for me. And that was with a very, *very* good English teacher who encouraged class discussion and *discouraged* the notion of any ""official"" way to look at the text. At the same time, I'm hoping that 15 years and the constraints of a 270-320 word essay this time around will help me look at it with fresh eyes. We shall see.;Dawn, good luck! I suffered through an entire year of Hawthorne back in high school because my English teacher had a crush on him. That's not hyperbole - she told us early and often that, ""If Nathaniel Hawthorne came back from the dead, I'd divorce my husband in a hot minute!""I found him *deadly* dull and predictable, but if you like your stories chock full of symbolism, you may have an altogether different opinion. :);LOL! I liked Hawthorne alright for a while, but I eventually burnt out on him and all of his favorite things, and I've remained so, sad to say. I can only take so much sin, hearts, red, ugliness-is-the-worst-thing-in-the-world, and the like. He had a very interesting perspective on the world, and he wasn't an unattractive man, but by the fifth straight month of him, I began to picture him as the nineteenth century equivalent of one of my many obnoxious classmates... the ones who would buttonhole me in the halls to tell me, at length and with great earnestness, that God was watching me and He loved me, but the wages of sin are death and if I didn't convert to their flavor of Christianity, I would never get to heaven. (I was first a liberal Protestant, then converted to Catholicism, and while I *never* discussed religion at school, that didn't matter... it was a small public school around the corner from a massive southern church which 99% of the student body attended, so they knew us by our absence, as it were.) Anyway, after a while,   Hawthorne took on that same feel for me... the earnest, intelligent, interesting guy who *always* brings everything back to the same subject in the end!Poe, on the other hand... rowr. As the kids are saying these days, ""I'd hit it."" :);Scott, that's not quite what I said. There's a reason I included the context in which I studied Hawthorne... the context affected how I saw the text, and I fully admit that. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to completely divorce any text from the context in which we have first read it. Not impossible, I grant you, but difficult, if we are honest with ourselves. Having been subjected to a solid nine months of studying Hawthorne (with no breaks or studying other authors in between), in an environment where my modern peers *were* preaching at me (it wasn't just me, by the way... it's a cultural/religious doctrine thing where I live, and that's okay) made all the religious notes of Hawthorne's work stand out to me. That's certainly not all there is to see in his work - believe me, nine months gives one a fairly good understanding of the breadth of what he wrote. I'm not planning on skipping Hawthorne for this course, so actually, I *will* be re-reading it.That doesn't change the fact that I'd honestly rather have a root canal. I am Hawthorne'd out. But I'll re-read his work, and write my essay, and try to find something new... which is what we are all here for, no?As for Poe, the list of authors who behaved abominably in their personal lives is long and varied. I like Hemingway,   F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Hunter Thompson, too, doesn't mean I do my own writing hopped up on drugs and booze, or that I condone incest. All art attracts a motley crew of sometimes unbalanced characters, and some are more unbalanced than others. But through their flaws, they sometimes find universal truths... for me, that's one of the things Poe's work does. I respect that it doesn't do that for everyone.;Lauren, all good points. I'm reminded of the people who condemn John Lennon for being a misogynist, an alcoholic, a drug abuser, often willfully cruel to those closest to him, and easily taken in to causes he didn't necessarily understand. All perfectly valid criticisms of his behavior. But one can like his work without condoning the darker aspects of what he was capable of, and I don't know how I would have turned out if I'd been asked to choose between my mother and father at age four, lost my only father figure at 14, and then lost my mother at 17. None of those are *excuses* for the times he behaved badly in his adult life, but it is easy to see how parental abandonment played into his tendency to act outrageously.;Again, I never said he was a paragon of virtue - I said that the context in which I was studying his work lead to my finding parallels between the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what he wrote and the ""hell and damnation"" aspects of what my modern peers believed. You have latched onto one word (earnest) and have concluded that by ""earnest"" I meant *virtuous* in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth. One can be very earnest while advocating an offensive, strident, disrespectful, unnuanced, or amoral point of view. ""Earnest"" is not a synonym for ""honest."" ""Earnest"" means ""with great personal conviction."" A person can earnestly tell you you are going to burn in hell, or   earnestly tell you that one person's life is inherently worth less than another's, or earnestly tell you you were kidnapped by aliens last night and replaced with a pod person. It doesn't make what they say true; ""earnest"" means *they* believe it to be true.Do I think Hawthorne had deep personal convictions that he believed to be true? Yes. Do I *agree* with them? No. Which is one of the reasons I am not excited about delving back into his world.;Scott, no worries. I apologize for our lightheartedness, as it clearly touched a nerve for you; I certainly didn't mean any harm by it, and I don't think anyone else did either. This is a pretty intense course, and some of us deal with the heavy workload by being silly on the boards from time to time. I too find both men to be fascinating *people*, in good ways and bad, and I might like both author's works, had we stopped at, say, three Hawthorne novels/collections. Unfortunately, overexposure, the environment in which I first studied his work, and the fact that the teacher in question was far more in love with Hawthorne the *man* than Hawthorne the *author*, and told us so regularly (and, in my mind, to an inappropriate degree) ruined any ability I might have to *enjoy* as opposed to *appreciate* his work. I still *appreciate* it, in the same sense I do any author... but *enjoyment* isn't something I can find in Hawthorne anymore.At least, I haven't yet. We'll see what a fresh look does for me.;Lazy writing. ;) I kid, of course... in my opinion, you've already answered your own question - it is, indeed, ""prepackaged symbolic baggage and shorthand referential stuff from other books."" But by modern standards, using too many quotations and not enough subtle allusion *is* considered lazy writing, which is why books that employ too much direct quoting feel dated by today's standards.;I very much understand your frustration, but keep in mind, too, that we all have varying levels of proficiency (expertise) in English. So, particularly with regard to grammar and spelling, what looks excellent to one peer might need improvement in the eyes of another peer. I know that if I were evaluating essays in my second or third languages, I would miss many grammar errors; being fluent in a language is not necessarily the same as being fluent enough to correct someone *else's* grammar/spelling in print! It's also entirely possible for one to be very fluent in English but not be very good at spotting grammar/spelling errors... there are plenty of native English speakers who have difficulty with spelling and grammar. Ideally, peers would take an extra few seconds to make their position more clear. For instance, instead of ""Great grammar and spelling,"" one could say: ""English is not my native language, but I can find no errors,"" or ""Grammar is not my strongest area, but this looks good to me,"" or ""Your grammar and spelling is terrific - this is coming from an English teacher!"" (or an English major, or a writer, or ""one who loves to read,"" or whatever might convey that your grasp of grammar is strong).It's just a matter of adding a few extra words to clarify where your *own* abilities are on the scale. I know it's a very short peer review period, but if *many* of us make that little extra effort, perhaps peer feedback will become more useful.Think of it this way - if anonymous' comments, instead of being:""Great use of grammar and spelling"" and""Was terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling""Were:""Not good on grammar and spelling myself, but this looks like great use of grammar and spelling"" and ""Terrible and distracting from incorrect use of grammar and spelling. For example, (wrong word) should be (right word) and (incorrect spelling) should be (correct spelling). You need a comma after (word), and a period after (word).""Then the two comments would not look contradictory at all. One peer thought the grammar and spelling was good, but he/she admits English grammar is not their strong suit. The other peer considers himself/herself more confident in written English, and provides helpful examples for improvement. (The examples may or may not be *correct*, but if examples are provided, the person whose essay is being reviewed can then decide for themselves if Peer #2 actually knows what they are talking about!)I'm not saying those of us who are confident in our English skills are obligated to go through and point out every single tiny error - that would take more time than most of us have within the two day period. But if you're going to criticize grammar, provide at least an example or two. If you are going to leave *no*   criticism for form, and it is perfect in every way, then try to be specific about what you're praising. That way, we can all help each other.The same applies to content grading, by the way. Be specific about what you like and do not like, so that we can learn from each other. If you have specific qualifications (English teacher/student of English/voracious reader/writer) mention them. if you have specific difficulties (non-native English speaker/dyslexic/have a hard time noticing grammar errors etc), mention those. Toss that information in the third box for general comments, if you like... that way you can just copy paste that note into each essay you evaluate. Again, providing that information isn't a matter of ""bragging rights"" or self-deprecation... we are *all* intelligent, attentive students, in Dr. Rabkin's words. But providing that information can provide some valuable *context* for what you have said. Keeping in mind, of course, that just because one claims to be an English teacher or a writer doesn't mean they know what they're talking about, and just because someone is a non-native speaker doesn't mean they *don't* know what they are talking about. All feedback is worth considering, no matter who it comes from. But, particularly if you are going to be especially full of praise or especially critical of an essay, context is useful to have.;LOL. As my parents used to remind me, ""There is a bottom 10% to every graduating class and every profession!"" Also, this is the internet, so just because someone claims qualifications doesn't necessarily mean they have them.And before anyone else mentions it, there are plenty of non-native English speakers whose English is better than most native English speakers.So, my general suggestion is that disclosing any detriments or particular talents is helpful... if English is your second (third, fourth, etc) language, but you know you are very proficient in it, then the fact that you are a non-native speaker is probably not relevant - unless you run across an idiom or other construction which is unfamiliar to you, in which case it may be worth mention"

It's far from the greatest thing I've ever written... the word count got me on this one. I had to rework my conclusion entirely in order to fit in most of my  points, and it shows. Audience and purpose cost me words, since not  everyone is familiar with ""bloody"" as an oath!Careful study of Dracula unearths compelling rewards for  those who seek them. While Stoker   s portrayal of different accents and  dialects is often incorrect to the point of parody, in chapter 24, an  account that initially appears to be full of amusing Van Helsing  malapropisms also serves a second purpose;   when carefully examined, it  reinforces the importance of blood in the narrative.Van Helsing  recounts the beginning of his conversation with the sailors in broad  terms     Dracula arrives, requests passage, the captain    swear[s] much,     and later, the captain    swear[s] at [Dracula] in many tongues.    Van  Helsing clearly does not feel the need to repeat the exact words used.Quite suddenly, his manner of storytelling shifts, and he  does relate  the exact language:    the captain tell[s] him that he had better be  quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood,  before the turn of the tide, with blood.    We could interpret this as  Stoker providing his readers with some levity; the average Briton  intuitively realizes the captain   s actual words were    bloody quick,""  etcetera, in the sense of the well-known oath.However, the  discerning reader can also interpret the passage as follows: The captain  tells Dracula he had better be quick with his bloody (unclean) package,  for the ship will leave the ""place of blood"" (England, the site of the  attacks), before the turn of the bloody tide     the tide carrying Dracula  is indeed a symbolically bloody one, having been the route he took to  both begin and end his reign of terror. Van Helsing adds,    The captain swear again, polyglot    (further  drawing the distinction between unimportant swearing and important  references to blood), and relates that the captain does not want  Dracula, ""with blood [upon him], in his ship, with blood on her also.   Throughout  this passage, Van Helsing interprets    bloody    in a deliberately literal  sense, unlocking a wealth of symbolism and implying that the captain  does not desire Dracula aboard his ship for fear that granting a vampire  safe passage might stain his soul, or, indeed, the    soul    of the very  ship itself.;I think Lauren's main point is that some of our peers are using the review process as an excuse to be nasty as opposed to helpful. In order for criticism to qualify as *constructive* criticism, one needs to point out something that could be improved *and* something the writer has done well... thus Dr. Rabkin's instructions.There is also a little bit of finesse required in order for the negative aspect of criticism to be helpful. ""Your writing is not academically fit"" or ""This is terrible"" are not *helpful* criticisms, because they don't explain *why*... where, exactly, is it ""not fit?"" What, exactly, is ""terrible?"" The grammar? (cite the mistakes, and give a fix.) The wording? (cite the awkward phrasing, and give a fix.) The lack of thesis? (provide a possible thesis and explain where the essay drifts from the thesis.) Yes, that takes more time than ""Terrible."" ""Good."" ""I liked this."" ""You suck."" But that's what constructive criticism *is*. Note the instructions again, which say: ""An ideal response would note one aspect of Form/Content that the writer does  well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form/Content that the  writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear."" (emphasis mine). ""In ways you make clear"" is a vital phrase. No criticism is helpful if you do not make clear exactly what was good and exactly what needed improvement. Saying ""grammar sucked"" or ""usage wrong"" or ""essay not clear"" is simply not helpful. The writer knows that you didn't like it, but they don't know how to fix it, or even if they really did something wrong.And I would strongly suspect that some of the people complaining of ""contradicting feedback"" are themselves guilty of not being specific in the feedback they leave for others.I don't have any professional qualifications with regard to critiquing, I'm just a lifelong writer who's critiqued my peers in classroom settings, in writing circles, and over the internet for many, many years, all in non-anonymous venues. I think it's the anonymity of peer reviews and the short time we have to complete peer reviews that's breeding this brand of laziness in some.Note that throughout this post I have referred to ""some"" peers, not all or many - I have received great, helpful feedback, useless, vague feedback, and specific feedback wherein the reviewer clearly didn't know what they were talking about (such as that semicolons should never be used, only ""dots"" (periods)). I much prefer helpful feedback, and even feedback that is incorrect but honest and polite, to nasty or vague feedback. Since the feedback regarding semicolons was quite polite, for example, I am re-evaluating whether semicolons are appropriate for this audience and purpose. Had that reviewer just said ""bad punctuation!"" I wouldn't have known what bothered them, and had they been rude (""Your sentences are far too long. Dots are the only appropriate thing!"") I would have written them off (and been confused!).;Paul, all good points. I didn't read anyone in this particular thread as being unable to live with peer assessment; for myself, I have accepted it as the way this platform works, and it serves my purposes as a low income person who lives in a country where higher education is significantly more expensive than it is in the UK and EU. (One year of uni cost me $30,000 US, and I could only get half of it covered by scholarships, because few people have those sums lying around, so even affluent students compete for aid... effectively pricing out students such as myself, for whom even $1000 US is a princely sum. Needless to say, I am still paying off that one year of uni 15 years later.) I read Lauren's posts as frustrated, but willing to offer suggestions as to how to peer review in a more useful way. That's the spirit in which I made my post, too. Critiquing is indeed a difficult skill, and I doubt anyone expects all of our peers to be able to do so on a ""professional"" level; this course is not geared toward ""professionals,"" for a start, so that would be an unrealistic expectation to have.By the same token, if we wish to improve the usefulness of peer review feedback, there is no guidance or involvement by the professors regarding how to do so. In previous courses I've taken, when problems with the rubric emerged, the professors adjusted the rubric and clarified expectations. The leaders of this course are content to let us find our own way. That being the case, the only way to improve peer feedback is for those of us who are more experienced to explain where the problems are, and, broadly, how to improve them amongst ourselves. That's not just hollow complaining, in my book - it comes from a genuine desire to help everyone get the most out of the course... even, and perhaps especially, those who are struggling with how to *give* feedback.;"

Part of it is because I had to bow out of the Frankenstein essay (life got very crazy all at once, and I found myself both mentally and physically exhausted), and my brain very quickly gets ""out of practice"" at this kind of formal writing. Even when I'm out of practice, though, writing comes very easily to me... I usually glance over my notes, bang out 600-800 words in 20 minutes, and then spend the next few days paring things down and perfecting what I want to say. Revision takes time, but the initial act of getting my thoughts down is almost never a problem.Not so this week! I knew what my topic was, but I couldn't seem to form coherent sentences about it, let alone distill those into a thesis. It's at times like these that I realize what it must be like for people to whom writing doesn't come easily... I can't imagine how they manage, because mere hours of not having my ""writing mojo"" drives me around the bend!With time running out in the wee hours of the morning, my tea going cold, and a busy day ahead of me (effectively eating the last few hours of submission time), I was beginning to panic. Then it hit me... when I come up against these moments of inarticulateness in my creative writing, I put my headphones on and crank up the music... and I hadn't done that in a while. So, I loaded up three albums worth of U2 (Achtung Baby, Zooropa and How To Disassemble an Atomic Bomb, for the curious), turned up the volume, and went to work.Seventy minutes later, done. It's a ridiculous thing to forget after twenty-five years of writing, but the truth is, I always write better with a ""soundtrack.""... and often, when I'm struggling for the right words to put on the page, I do forget that!I once had the fortune to converse, very briefly, with Aaron Sorkin (writer of A Few Good Men, The West Wing, Sports Night, The American President, and Charlie Wilson's War amongst many others). I used my opportunity to ask him the same question in the title of this thread: ""How do you write? The ideas of a fiction writer are ephemeral, but what's your process? When you're sitting down to write something, do you have rituals or need things just so?""Here was his reply:""Story's what I struggle with the most (a handicap if you do what I do for a living.) My parents started taking me to plays when I was very little and lots of times they took me to plays I was too young to understand but I always loved the sound of dialogue and that's what I wanted to imitate when I started writing.          I worship at the alter of intention and obstacle. (Somebody wants something-- something's standing their way of getting it. As Neil Simon says, ""It doesn't matter what the person wants--he wants the girl, he wants the money, he wants to get to Philadelphia, it doesn't matter, he's got to want something."" I'll take it a step further and say that anytime you can substitute the words ""need"" for ""want"" you'll be in even stronger shape. The obstacle has to be formidable and the intention and obstacle will be the drive shaft of your story. Now you can start laying in themes and writing dialogue in your own style. (At the risk of being pretentious I want to recommend a 64 page pamphlet by Aristotle called ""The Poetics"". Basically, he wrote out the rules of what drama is. If I'm writing something and it's come off the rails in mid-draft or something's not working in rehearsal, it's usually because I've broken one of the rules and my job is to figure out which one and how.)       As far as my writing environment, I write in an office on the Warner Bros. lot and I have a small office at home. I play music in my car and hope that something I hear gets something going. I'm very active when I write--jumping up and down from my desk and pacing around and playing all the characters.        Woody Allen doesn't have a desk in his office. He writes on a four-poster bed sitting up on one elbow. Stephen Sondheim writes while lying down on a couch. He writes for 10 minutes and naps for 20 minutes. Stephen King whips off a trilogy in the time it takes me to shave in the morning. Sam Shepard used to drop acid, hop in his pick-up and drive to a cabin the mountains where he'd write True West in a weekend. Write the way you write.          Aaron""  Needless to say, that gracious note of his has survived about three hard drive failures now; I keep it backed up on the same three thumb drives I keep my writing on. (Redundancy is a writer's best friend in a technology driven world.)

What helps you get those essays done... or whatever other writing you have on your plate?;Were I evaluating that essay, I'd be tempted to give it a 1 solely out of pique... I dearly wanted to write an essay on The Cask of Amontillado, as it's been my favorite Poe story since I was very small. If I couldn't use that (and, out of respect for my classmates and their time, I did not!), then they can't use The Masque of the Red Death!(I'm kidding about grading on the basis of pique, of course... but I would be very irritated indeed... and such an essay probably does deserve a 1 on the basis of ""did not follow directions."");I *wanted* to compare the two, but I would in no way have had room to do justice to either... not in 320 words. I am happy with my decision to focus on Poe alone, having now seen five essays that hurriedly summarize Poe and then hurriedly summarize Hawthorne, and end up saying little about either.I'm not saying it can't be done; I'm sure some people did it quite well. But for myself, I would've needed a good 800 words to work with in order to write a compare/contrast essay that was truly insightful. Given that, I chose to be insightful about one author rather than be banal about both.;"

I'm going to have to skim them and be uncharacteristically pithy* in my comments, because I really don't have time to be re-reading more Poe, much as I'd like to. Like everyone else, I've got Wells to tackle.*Said pithiness will not extend to comments I plan to leave regarding the importance of reading the syllabus and following directions. Arrgh.;Patricia, fair point! The Hawthorne section was quite well done, so I may give it a passing grade, albeit grudgingly. I suppose I was thinking about re-reading the unassigned stories because I like to leave thoughtful feedback even when the essay doesn't meet the requirements. In this case, though, since the author of the essay made no effort to follow the syllabus, it's reasonable for me to not put much effort into feedback. I guess I just don't like to appear as though I'm engaging in tit-for-tat, even anonymously, since peer feedback is the only form of feedback available to us in this course.So I wish I could afford to be more generous with feedback, if not the actual grade... but in the interests of time, I'll be taking your advice.;Essays are definitely improving. I gave my first 6 this time around, and was thrilled to do so. It was a truly flawless essay.;I really should be getting to grips with my Wells essay, but I can never resist a Who thread... Indeed, my Doctor is asexual. I can be persuaded to see him as asexual romantic (i.e. not interested in sex, but occasionally forming intense relationships that have romantic undertones)... that's how I interpret his feelings for Rose, and even Sarah Jane Smith. He's capable of forming very deep emotional attachments, he just doesn't want to shag. ;) ;I'm fairly sure that statement is just clarifying that the grading process is peer based. Put another way, it's saying ""Your grade according to a random sample of your peers is ___, but it may have scored higher or lower with a different peer group, or if it had been reviewed by a professor.""It is probably phrased that way for a few different reasons. In addition to clarifying that peer review is subjective, that statement may be pointing to the fact that the professor does have the option of recalibrating the grades or making certain portions of the assignment extra credit after the grading period has ended. Dr. Rabkin has chosen not to take advantage of any of these features, so in this class, the grade we receive is the final grade. In other courses I have taken, there were various avenues to improve your grade, if the professor retroactively decided to ""grade on a curve"" (because no one in the class did well), or to make part of the assignment extra credit (because most of the class forgot the second part), or by submitting your peer reviewed paper directly to the professor for a recheck, etc. All of these things are quite time-intensive for the professor, to my understanding, which may be why Dr. Rabkin opted out. In any case, the answer is that in *this* class, the grade listed is the final grade. In other classes, the grade listed might not be so permanent (usually in the sense that you may have ways to bring that grade up).;Anyone want to discuss ""The Country of the Blind""? As a person with a congenital disability, I found the story fascinating, and it reveals certain truths about the disabled community that remain today, both good and bad. If I write my essay on this one, I think my greatest challenge is going to be how to discuss it without putting it in too much of a modern context - per the instructions to avoid discussing non-literary matters.;@Mussarat, that is a fascinating interpretation. The idea of nature vs. technology hadn't occurred to me because of my own prior knowledge. In modern society and with modern advancements in science, we now understand that blind people, deaf people, and th;I think that is a great interpretation too. To be honest, having never read the story until now (I'm not sure how it escaped my notice for so long!), I was prepared for either a purely allegorical tale, or a moralizing tale about how disability turns people into savages, as the world often seems to fear even to this day. (It is difficult to organize an event purely for people with disabilities, because non-disabled people are for some reason always concerned that we will trash the space and have never learnt how to function in society... and then it is difficult to get disabled people to *attend* such events, as many of them are equally afraid that a large gathering of disabled people cannot politely conduct themselves, or will otherwise be a ""bad influence"".) So, I would not have blamed Wells for taking such an approach, as the strange fears and misconceptions still exist today; but I was gratified that he did not tell quite such a simple story.;Masako, true, and yet in the end, it is the sighted man, Nunez, who dies in the mountains. The Country of the Blind survives.The revised ending portrays the reverse, which raises an entirely new set of questions.;It is a ""pit"" to Nunez. Not so to the inhabitants, who praise its water, land, etc. Your interpretation is completely valid, but I think one of the things Wells is saying in this story is that the value of intangible things (like sight) depend upon who is doing the valuing. What is the value of sight if you live in a place where no one has ever seen, and sight is not necessary to accomplish any task? Nunez's sight *has* no value to the inhabitants. That is why he cannot become their King. What to him is priceless enough to risk his life for, is useless fancy to them. Similarly, the community does not find Medina-sarote beautiful, because she does not feel beautiful to the touch. To Nunez, she is beautiful, because she looks beautiful. The two societies (sighted and blind) value things differently, and those valuations affect how they see the world and each other. Nunez sees the blind as deprived and less than (recall how he can't bring himself to strike a blind man, insinuating that to do so would be morally inappropriate because the blind are at a disadvantage - a misconception he then finds to be untrue). The blind see *Nunez* as ignorant (""newly formed"") and less than, because he is bad at living as they do. There is no real ""right side"" or ""wrong side"" to this story, in my view. It is fundamentally about two societies who have completely different experiences of what the world *is*... and what happens when those two societies come together.Just food for thought... I can only walk a few steps, and that is all I have ever been able to walk. I have never run, and will never run. I feel no desire to ever do so, because I can travel faster than the average runner in my wheelchair, anyway. Thus, I don't consider myself ""deprived"" of anything. Ablebodied society does, though, and because ablebodied society *assumes* that I am deprived and unable, I have often found myself deprived of *opportunities*, on the mistaken belief that I am unable to avail myself of them. So, did the deprivation come about because I am disabled, or because other people make assumptions about what my disability means to *them*? Most ablebodied people would say that that deprivation is caused by my disability. I would argue that the deprivation in fact comes from erroneous *assumptions* about what I can and cannot do. In an accessible environment, or with a little time to devise my own accessibility modifications, I am often *more able* than most ablebodied people. To *me*, disability is not the problem, assumptions and prejudice are. To ablebodied people, their assumptions and/or prejudices aren't the problem, the problem is that I had the temerity to be disabled in the first place.Neither view is empirically wrong or right; it all depends on one's point of view.;I understand what you were saying. No worries, I am a fan of civilized discussions, and this is one of those. :) I agree that robbing Nunez of his sight was not the right choice. That, to me, was one of the most interesting parts of the story, because I see a similar attitude in disabled communities today. At gatherings of disabled people, I am considered ""not *really* disabled"" because I can stand and walk a few steps. I have been disabled all my life, and do a lot of advocacy work on behalf of all kinds of disabilities, so that attitude is both amusing and irritating... but the fact remains, many people consider me ""not one of them"" because I can bear weight for short periods. Of course, the ablebodied world doesn't consider me one of them, either, so I often have one foot in both worlds. It's not a bad way to live one's life, and for me, it has worked well... but it does occasionally make me feel like I don't ""belong"" in either world.So to me, the scene where they decide to remove Nunez's eyes had a special resonance, because the disabled community as a whole still does suffer from this idea that only when we all have exactly the same disability can we work together for equality! This attitude is exactly why the disability rights movement in my country (USA) has stalled. We spend all of our time arguing about whose needs are ""more important"" or who gets to be ""first"", and end up accomplishing little for anyone.But that is, of course, a very modern interpretation of the story, and thus, such an interpretation is outside the scope of this course.;Thanks, Sean, I'll check that out!Hmm, I can see the religious perspective. Starting to wonder if I should go within a million miles of this story for my essay, as I'm afraid I might get penalized for interpreting it ""too literally""!;I'm still debating... I've got what I want to do blocked out, and it won't by any means be an exhaustive traipse through the history of disability rights/culture (because I've no room for that, it's off topic, and I'm not terribly inclined to do so). My hesitation comes mainly from the fact that this course *is* subtitled ""...our modern world,"" and I'm probably one of few in the class who brings this particular lens to the discussion, so it could, if written well, certainly enrich the reading for some/most, if handled through a modern lens *but also* from a literary perspective. I'm reminded of the essay I saw on the Hawthorne/Poe thread about ""Refrigerator Women,"" a concept that had not yet formed as a crystallized, titular literary phenomenon in Hawthorne and Poe's day, but which certainly applies. That, to me, is an example of a valid way to apply a modern concept in a relevant way, and I think I can follow that path.However, if I do go that route, I run the risk of peer reviewers thinking I willfully omitted or was blind (no pun intended) to the standard literary metaphors that blindness brings up... and that's not so, of course. It's just that that sort of thing has been done and done again, and this particular story said something different to me. With the revised ending (rocks fall, everyone dies... except the heroic sighted man, of course), the symbolism would have leapt at me first. With the original ending, and knowing that Wells had a penchant for using his writings to muse about how societies function (and fall into dysfunction), I see very different messages - not all of them good, but all fundamentally more interesting and more rarely encountered.You're correct, I've got plenty of room to hang a potential albatross around my neck on this one, but I like your idea of writing two and posting my preferred take on the forums, too. I think that's going to come down to time, so I'll see what happens.;(Warning, this may be outside the scope of this conversation - it is certainly outside the scope of the story!)I'm finding the discussion of proprioception vs. vision interesting because, due to my congenital disability, my experience is *entirely* different! I didn't even catch the error, because although both my proprioception and my vision are fine, my ability to walk depends on proprioception *and* vision *and* something else I've never been able to pinpoint... and, in fact, scientists are still trying to determine what that third something is via medical studies. Briefly, if I look down at my feet when walking, I will fall (immediately, straight to the ground). This former mystery has been solved due to research on the elderly; as one's balance decreases with age, vision becomes more important to compensate for balance (because visual input tells you how close you are to upright). Elderly people who look at their feet as they walk suffer more falls because their brain does not have enough visual input to tell which way is up!If someone crosses my path while I'm walking, I'll fall (again, the effect is immediate). If I plan to walk from point A to point B, and someone is standing in my path, my body freezes up and I cannot take a step - even if I can see that I have room to go around them. Because these issues have nothing to do with proprioception or vision, this is what scientists are still trying to figure out... what about that particular form of visual input causes the brain to short out the motor functions, even when the person can see that the person will only temporarily be in the way, or that there is room to go around? This happens to people with very specific medical conditions - multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, cerebral palsy (what I have) and some, but not all, stroke patients. The conditions share some common clinical signs, but each is a very different form of injury/malfunction in the brain... so modern medicine is still trying to figure out what's going on.;I find it somewhat amusing that in previous weeks, my reviewers all said things like ""I would have liked to see more about ____, but I appreciate we're all working with a tight word limit."" And this week, my reviewers all said, ""This would have been better if you had contrasted it with (between two and four additional works)."" Well, yes, of course it would have, if I had had the space to do so....;"

And I'd like to take this opportunity to see if any of my reviewers see this, if they can develop their comment. It would be great it there was a full discusion: I have no way of responding to the comments.My essay:When a character wants to perform a certain deed    magical or otherwise- in a fairy tale, they generally announce it. It is through their voices that we get to know the character   s intentions -we don   t generally have access to their thoughts. Given this situation, the importance of the speech is enormous, especially regarding its relationship with action.                                 If we analyze ""The Three Little Men in the Wood    we can see the performativity lies in the speech.   This doesn   t mean there aren   t actions without words, but that the phrases spoken have a material effect. This can be more direct, like granting a wish (the words become true: the reward the men decide to give the heroine), or more subtle (like when they ask for bread).                                 We can go further and hypothesize that the importance lies in the literal words and not so much in the intention behind them: the step-sister speaks her own sentence doubtlessly ignoring she is condemning herself.                                 Words becoming true not only happen in this story, but in many of Grimm   s. The fisherman calls the fish with verses (   The Fisherman and his Wife   ), the tailor saves himself from the armed guard by stating he knows they are at his door (   The Gallant Tailor   ), the robber   s bride relates the story of what happened to her in order to accuse her husband-to-be (   The Robber Bridegroom   ). And all spells are casted by incantations, which are in the end speech.                                 There are many examples where the spoken word has a great relevance. But perhaps the most important role it has is the constitution of the story itself. We have to take into account these tales were originally narrated orally: such situation is the first example of words bringing things to life. So, it shouldn   t surprise us much that in a world built by speech, words have such power of creation.  Comments:Formpeer 1      Sentences structure and usage are correct and well-written. At times it's difficult to follow, but the writing comes back to the main idea in the end.peer 2      Form is well constructed, easy to follow. I myself forgot division in paragraphs, but it looks more neatly this way. I'm not sure about typping space before, but not after - bothers me.peer 3      The overall basic structure of the assignment is quite good, and there is a continuity in thought between paragraphs. However, at several instances the use of incorrect word choice has resulted in ambiguity. Sometimes, the use of simple words can lead to better crystallization of our thoughts on paper.peer 4      This essay is gramatically clear. The exposition in this case is laid out quite clearly. He/she uses simple words in order to explain a complex theme in Grimm Brothers' tales, which I think is good, because not only scholars but everyone can get what she/he is trying to say. I consider that his or her ideas can be synthetized better next time.peer 5      The language is not very clear and do not really understand the basic reasoning or argument, perhaps would have made more sense if he started saying that stories are an oral tradition and hence the importance of words...Contentpeer 1      An interesting idea to focus on speech. Given the extremely short word limit, I'd like to know more about how you'd analyze more deeply by looking at fewer examples more closely.peer 2      If ""it shouldn   t surprise us much"", when why bother. Why write an essay on the obvious? The task was to enrich the reader, but if writer him/herself doesn't see meaningful insight, how can I see it.peer 3      The concept of the ""power"" of words is certainly interesting. I especially like how the writer has connected the importance of storytelling and the use of words in different contexts. However, I think this essay would benefit with the use of topic sentences to help the readers understand the writer's point of view better.peer 4      I think the content developed on this essay is interesting beacuse it deals with the basis of the tales: language. He/she gives examples in order to sustain his/her ideas, which is good and bad at the same time. It is good because I think examples are always quite didactic, but it's bad because they fill too much space in this essay that could be used in the deeper development of the ideas.peer 5      the arguments are very complex and not very clear, The idea is interesting but should have been developed in the context it is difficult to follow the logical argument of the essay.Other commentspeer 1      Overall an interesting writing piece!peer 2      I might not be good judge and I'm worse than the writer of essay, so feel free to ignore comments. Sorry for my english.peer 4      I consider you're in the right track, just try to balance the amount of developed ideas with the amount of examples given.peer 5      May be you can consider the possibility of investigate the nature of language in myth or the way of language is received by us through the myth determines what we think like Nietzsche said...;Poulomi, thank you very much! Specially about the structure of my essay :)As to the ""underground"" selection, I fail to see how can that be of importance: whether I've chosen non mainstream tales, or you've chosen one of the most known ones, that shouldn't matter to the analysis. I have to say I DON`T agree with your peer. As long as it's a Grimm tale, it`s worth writing about it (and valid).;Thank you Anonymous (who I take to be the person who posted their essay after Poulomi). Even if my peer 2 response may have been a little arrogant, I actually agree on that point: my choice of words was not the most happy one. What I meant to say was ""In a world built by speech, it makes sense/it  s coherent that words have such power of creation"". Anyway, this correction wasn't suggested by peer 2, he didn't suggest anything at all-that's the disappointing part.;Anthony, our essays were very similar! In content, I mean. It is clear that to power of the spoken word is fructiferous topic.  Just one small thing: you quoted The Fisherman and His Wife in italics, and then in normal way in another line. Actually, as it is a tale (and not the whole ""book"", that would be Children and Household Tales), it should be between double commas, as in ""The Almond Tree"", which you wrote correctly. You also forgot the double commas when naming ""Rapunzel"" the story, to set apart from Rapunzel, the character. It's a detail concerning form, but I thought it may be useful to point out, specially for unit V's essay.;On your essay: I think your main idea was interesting. However, the results looks more than a recollection of ""Red Riding Hood"" different versions. Even if you do mark the differences, the conclusion that states that the story remains the same seems to be lacking the other part of the argument: the similarities. Since you're dealing with various versions, a search for a common core would have been the path to that conclusion.On the comments you've received: It looks that your peer can't tell the difference between content and form. ""Your conclusion is not supported by the essay"" is a content critic, not a form one. The same happens the other way around: ""  I would avoid using overworked words"" is in regards to form, not content.And in a personal note, I totally support you on your choice of the expression ""In conclusion"". It's clear and pertinent, not ""un-college"" at all. But I guess that depends on the different backgrounds we come from.;I agree with peer 4 on his comment about form-the last sentence needs some kind of articulation. Other than that, form seems to be adequate.  In content, I think the most insightful comment was  from  peer 3.  By the way, I love that you posted your essay in a blog!*edited for grammar mistake;I can't explain the misuse, sorry, you'll probably have to wait for a native-speaker to do so. But I can point at other formal mistakes:""exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence""> put them, as ""them"" is the direct object of ""put"", not the subject (the subject is ""numbers"" that comes, obviously, before the verb).""The other numbers appears""> appear, as the subject (numbers) is plural. I'm surprised no one remarked on this, even if they are non-native-speakers. It's about the first thing one learns in english. A typo from your part, probably, but definetely something that should have been noted by the peers.Another inconsistency: you wrote the essay mainly from ""we"", but at some point you said ""one"": ""One can suppose..."" Perhaps you did so to set that bit apart, since the supposition wouldn't be yours (and therefore, not our). But from the structural point of view, it sounds weird to start with a grammatical person and then change it. I respect it if it was intentional and a style decision: I wanted to point it out in case it was a slip-mistake.I'm not sure about the word Antiquity. I've looked it up and it does appear on Wikipedia, but I'm not sure if it's used... may I suggest Ancient times? Again, a native-speaker can decide on this point.""  ancient folks believed that exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence""> would. It's like undirect speech.;The beginning is a bit confusing. A tension is a struggle between two points in conflict: life and meaning wouldn't be in tension. You may say that life is in tension between meaning and a lack of sense.""A secondary binary element"", which one is it? The only binarism seems to be voluntary association and family ties, which don't seem to me as forming a binary. Are you talking about different types of human relationships (friends vs family, the opposition based on the fact that we don't choose our family)? It is not clear. Neither is the pertinance of this secondary binarism, or what is it secondary to (life vs meaning? But I've already said why I don't agree with that opposition).After the first paragraph, however, the essay becomes clearer and easy to follow (maybe not for a 3 year old, but that's an exaggerated criteria, if you ask me). It makes a thourough examination of the tale. I particularly liked the comparison between the golden beginning and the opaque ending.  The thing I disagree with the most is closing the essay with a moral. If you watch video 01.02, you'll see a moral analysis of the Grimm's tale is unadequate: to a literary-essay-reader, it is of no use what moral can he/she extract from a fairytale. I want to point this out because the same case appeared on two of the essays I had to evaluate. I didn't grade them ""1"", though, if the arguments were presented correctly-there is value in that too.I don't think 4 is a harsh grade, it is in fact the most expected one, since 2 is what most essays should be. About the rhetorical questions: I'm not sure I agree with that choice (particularly the ones on the second paragraph), but I would never mark them as mistakes, I consider them to be part of the writing style, and they are not functionally wrong.The idea that a 3-year-old should understand your essay is plainly ridiculous. In fact, he shouldn't: it is suppossed to be an academic work. Which also means, you shouldn't write as you speak. Even if the subject you're discussing is oral, copying or approaching that form isn't beneficial; you should apply the academic conventions.  I hope you find my comment useful, if you have any questions, do post them. I'm open for discussion of course, so if you think I'm mistaken in any of my corrections, please open the debate.;Rosevarte, thank you for taking time in explaining further. Unfortunately, the issue is still unclear. You say ""Whenever one has to decide between two sides, then there is tension"", a statement I totally agree with. But then how can you see a choice to be made between life and meaning? As to the other binary, I still don't know what you mean by voluntary associations, in opposition to family ties. My previous question ""Are you talking about different types of human relationships (friends vs family, the opposition based on the fact that we don't choose our family)?"" was not answered. In any part of the story does Hans have to choose between family or anything else, so you can see why I'm confused.  About the morality analysis: my main critic is that it's not a literary analysis. The problem with  argumentum ad auctoritatem is when you use an authority expert on a certain subject, but to argument on a different thing: if I'm an expert on cooking and from that place I recommend you what color to paint your room, for instance (a very gruesome example, indeed). Appealing to an expert on the subject you're discussing is a tool used in almost every academical essay: you yourself quoted Barthes to support your theory. Still, I know you may disagree with Proffesor Rabikin's point, you're completely entitled to your own opinion. I won't argue with that.  I will argue however that a morality analysis of a fairytale isn't enriching the reader of the essay. Just like stating your opinion (the story was nice, it was aweful, etc) isn't relevant in an academic literary discussion, pointing out the moral learnings you may get from reading a tale isn't of pertinance either. Why? In the end, it's all a matter of opinion. If I disagree and think the moral is Don't wish for more than you have, for you may end up with nothing, we would have reached an impass: there is no possibility for discussion, since it is our believes (and not the text interpretation) what is at stake. On the contrary, the fact that Hans' travel back home takes the form of numerous trades is undeniable, it's in the text. Then, you may analyse how comercial activity and travelling work in the story. Remember: it's literature what we are suppossed to discuss.;I don't know what you should have got, since we don't get to see your essay, only your forum posts, and, as Paul John Morris remarks, these are generally written more casually.  In any case, I don't know if a spell check is a good tool-specially seeing the results. I advise you to re-read your essay carefully and look for mistakes yourself: it will always be better than a machine that functiones authomatically without reflection. I would never ever consider a spelling check an authority in spelling. Grammar isn't dissociated from meaning, so the person reading or reviewing must understand what is the subject in discussion in order to judge the form. Even if we talk of form and content separately, they are deeply connected.  If you think you won't be able to spot mistakes on your own work, make someone else read it before submitting it.  ;Paul, I'm very interested in reading your essay, would you mind posting it, along with the comments?  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=284If you aren't comfortable with that, it's ok, I'm just taking a shot :);It's 20% of 3s top.""you should look not only at grammar looking for mistakes, but at IDEAS, ARGUMENTS, CONTENT, STRUCTURE and so on"". I want to point out that both are required for evaluation, that's why it's divided in form and content. Grammar matters, although when thinking about the most enriching essay, I would definetely weigh it regarding the content section.;Indeed, I've solved the puzzle thanks to your clue. There are five possible distributions; what Suzan posted below is just one of them.;It won't necessarily help you with your essay. But it may awake in you things concerning puzzles, numbers, word play, etc., that can be found in Alice... and Through... I don't think solving the puzzle will help you in the essay, but it's a nice thinking exercise.  ;That would be a Wonderland creature response! Or maybe something like: They are both part of the riddle (tautological answer);Yes, I've watched and loved it. It is clear from the title of the movie that Lewis Carrol's books work as the hyppotext to the film. In my opinion,  Phoebe in Wonderland  has a far more interesting vinculation with the text than Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland-which I hated, no, suffered from beginning to end.  ;Suzanne, I supposse you don't have much experience in reading literature.  I have to agree with your daughter. Crimes is not what fairytales are about, which doesn't mean they are excluded.Think it this way: when you see a film, a fictional film, do you always like what you see? Do you always wish such things happened in read world? I'd guess not. That doesn't mean that a piece of fiction, either a movie or a book, can't be entertaining and enriching if it pictures war, mysery, cruelty, etc.Still, if you loathe reading about violent issues so much, I wouldn't recommend this course to you. Like Luis Felipe said, you can always quit it, if you feel uncomfortable. Dracula, Frankenstein, Poe's stories all have dark topics.  And finally, to answer your question as why aren't more people outraged: it's because most of us can see past the violence and darkness in fiction, and can tell the difference between fiction and reality. It doesn't mean we like or accept ""thieving, and beatings, conniving, child abandonment, abuse and lets not forget the cannibalism"" in our daily lives.;Fantasy's most common sub-genre is undoubtly fairytales, such as the Grimm brothers'. I understand that if you took wikipedia's definition of Fantasy you're disappointed. I must admit I was a little confused with the term myself. I was thinking about fantastic literature, as Todorov understands it. Instead, here what ""Fantasy""   refers to is closer to what I know by ""maravilloso"" (which means ""wonderful""). ""Wonderful"" stories are those where the time and space are unidentified, and different from our own, which means the worlds portrayed have their own laws, accepted as natural by their inhabitants. For instance, magic would be supernatural in our world, in ""reality"", but it's common in most fairytales. The fantastic story would be an in-between: a world much like our own, where strange things happen, making it hard to decide if there is a supernatural event or being, or just a logical explanation behind. The best example for this is, in my opinion, ""The monkey's claw"" by Jacobs -I think it was mentioned in one of the course videos.  ;Suzanne, I have not read ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", and it doesn't ring a bell either. Who is the author?You mention Andersen. Have you read ""The Little Mermaid""? Don't you find it as cruel and shocking as Grimm's tales?Bruce, I don't agree with ""I don't think it is possible to have an emotional reaction if we don't have a psychic connection"", unless by psychic connection you don't mean empathy but simply understanding of the psychic situation of the character. But even so, I've had emotional reactions to characters I don't understand.  About Oedipus: the greek tragedies are meant to cause admiration and horror (see Aristotles for that). In order to do so, the hero (Oedipus here) must have virtues worth admiring, so you feel empathy in a level, but flaws so you don't identify yourself completely: the horror would be too much, unbearable. Aristotles explains it better, I'm just stating what I can remember.;""this very bitter, rude and ignorant person is also taking just about every course Coursera has to offer."" How do you know? If they posted as ""Anonymous""... please share your way of knowing this with the rest of us!By the way, when I say they posted as Anonymous, I mean to say I don't know if it's a he or she, not that there's more than one troll. All the other anonymous -including the one I quoted- weren't trolling at all.Also, I want to appologize to Stephanie for turning her thread into an anti-trolling section instead of debating the femininity...   the troll issue awakes indignation so strongly, it seems everyone has to express their concern.;I prefer books, in general, but that's not always the case.  Movis I prefer to books:The 39 stepsTies:A clockwork orange*I'll edit as I think of more.;I loved your two mirror theory!The quote ""And if he left off dreaming about you..."" is used as the epigraph in Borges' ""Las ruinas circulares"" (The circular ruins? I don't know how it was translated), where a person dreams another person without telling him he's been dreamt. I won't tell you how it ends in case you haven't read it (it's awesome), but there's a nice twist.Of course, Calderon de la Barca writes on this topic on his play La vida es sue  o  (Life is a dream? again, not sure about the translation). This work dates from 1635.  And to finish with literature references, an Unamuno quote (Mist): What is the real world but the dream we all dream, the common dream? (I translated because I couldn't find an official translation);At first I was confused, as I hadn't read about anything you've said. Then, at the end, when you say it's from Tim Burton's film, it made sense. Please keep in mind for your essay that we're supposed to analyse Carroll's work, not film adaptations.  ;Of course not, I was just pointing out that focusing only in Tim Burton's film isn't analysing Alice in Wonderland. If you want to examine the meaning of the vorpal sword in Carroll's book, you can't refer to Burton's production, you must use Carroll's text. If, on the other hand, you are comparing different versions, that's another story. What I meant to say is, don't loose sight of what must always be part of the essay: Alice in Wonderland and/or Through the Looking Glass, by Lewis Carroll. I didn't dismiss your comment, it is of course a valid forum comment: but forum material, not essay. Just thought it should be clear.;Exaclty, epistolary novels were common at that time. If you wanted to convey the story using the characters' voices, what best way to go than letters? And diaries. They are excuses to make the different characters ""talk"". It also makes the story more integrated, as well as varied. We have different points of view, different experiences, but not different stories told separately: they gather the material and put it together.  ;True. Even so, justification is usually provided: they say that writing calms them down, that it is important to document everything that happens, etc. It's a way to make it more believable. The activity of writing is always justified, and that caughts my attention enormously.;I'd advise a middle position. While I do believe the author's intention doesn't matter in your reading, considering only your interpretation can be misleading too. What I mean is, always work on your analysis rather than the author's-but don't invent something that the text doesn't say. That's what I mean when I say you shouldn't ""read what's not there"". Always work with the text. Looking for threads in a book will mean supporting your theory (audience participation) with quotes (textual work). This is in fact what Barthes does.  ;The movie Nosferatu (reference here  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/?ref_=sr_1) is a great film production on the vampires subject.  I have never eaten Count Chocula, but I know him from The Simpsons. They also have, that I remember, two halloween vampire stories: The one with Mr Burns as a vampire (that parodies a movie) and one that parodies Twilight.;One thing that caught my attention was that Alice says all poems she's heard that day (In Through the Looking Glass) are about fish, in some way. I fail to see fishes in the Jabberwocky (although one can argue she has read it, not heard it).  ;Hard to choose! I think the perspective is a powerful tool, and first person allows operations that the third doesn't (and the other way around too). I think I prefer first: to discovering the story along with the narrator, even if there are clues in advanced ( in the text itself, prolepsis if you will). Multiple narrators in first is awesome, an option fully explored in many books already, but that doesn't wear out.;If I had to choose a favorite book, it would be In Search of Lost Time, which is in first person. But it's a curious first person. The text also tells the story of Swann, for instance, in detail, from a time before the narrator was born. It even says what Swann felt and thought: in that part it seems really a third person. For pages, and pages (I don't know the exact number, but 100 wouldn't be exaggerated) the first person is erased... sometimes ""my grandfather"" appears, reminding us who is talking, but it is uncommon. Swann's story has even been published separately.  For those who can't decide between first and third person, Proust's book is an interesting case to examine.;Over two hundred? I only came up with five. I don't think there are that many number combinations. Maybe some of the responses derived out of the mathematical aspect.  ;I've just watched the last Unit II video, and the two hundred responses were for the raven/writing desk puzzle, not the 24-pig puzzle! I thought it was exaggerated...;Well, the cat's quote would be a possible argument for Alice's madness. But I see a progress rather than a losing her head (yes, word play intended with the Queen of Hearts) throughout her adventures in Wonderland. Even if she doubts of her identity, she becomes more and more sure of who she is:-After getting bigger for the first time, she questiones her identity, wondering if she's Mabel.-Later, when meeting the caterpillar, the insect asks her who she is, and she still cannot answer. But at least she can say she knows who she was that morning.  -Then, another enlargement happens, and she encounters the pigeon. She denies being a serpent (an affirmation of the identity, although through a negative way), and guesses she's a girl, with some doubts.  -When she meets the Queen of Hearts and is asked what's her name, she answeres Alice without a question. All her previous doubts have vanished. And even when later she suffers yet another enlargement, she doesn''t question her identity either.And about the cat's view: Alice at least doesn't seem to think it proves anything.  ;I am looking forward to Dracula, but not so much as I was looking forward on the first two units.;I must have missed the gay people thing... can you quote, please?And about stereotypes: think that this is Johnathan Harker's point of view. He's in a far away land, an exotic and mysterious place, so reasonably, anything that's different (and there are a lot of things) catches his attention and he describes it through his western european perspective. It won't necessarily be a negative aspect, but it's not strange that he points out the differences of cultures.;I'm definetely happier than with my first one. I hope I do better with the grade, too! But no matter the number, I know I've done a better job in this second instance.;That's great! I'm previewing peers' essays now too, and I'm really enjoying them, much unlike the Grimm experience!I hope you'll do better with books you like more. I think it's something that you wanted to ""say so much"" about a reading you didn't enjoy. That shows you're an objective critic! Or as objective as it can get...;Haha, self-boost confiden"

And the comments weren't very detailed. I suppossed it can happen for the first time, but for the secon time you have to evaluate, you should have learned the requierements: point out something positive and something to improve, and provide ideas for the improvement. In general, there wasn't much of that in the one-sentence comments I received.;If wouldn't be so bad if they told you those reasons, as you can improve from the remarks received. But when there is little constructive critisism, the same grade as the time before can be frustrating.;Post-modernism or post-structuralism is a critic position, whose most important exponents are Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. While I'd never quote wikipedia in an essay, I don't mind refering it in a forum:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism  (I'm not the Anon who first posted about postmodernism, I just joined in);I really liked this essay, it definitely enriched my reading of the book.I spotted one or two grammar mistakes, I think you should know which:""Alice's recitations of school geography and arithmetic while she falls through the rabbit hole in the beginning is equally incorrect,    but fun."" are equally incorrect, since recitations is plural. And it should be funny in the end, you're describing a noun, so you need an adjective. Like ""incorrect"", which is an adjective.""This also reflects the nature of Carroll, himself"" the comma is out of place.""compare thier own levels"" their. Typo, surely.  Keep up the good work!;yeah, do post it!;I loved it! Most perfect essay I've read so far. You did deserve a 6!;haha Javier. Because you are joking, right?;People may cite Freud to let you know they're taking him as reference and support. Whether you agree with it or not, you have to judge that IF taking Freud's point of view, the anaylisis makes sense or not.  ;It's not only right-left. Since a mirror is two dimentional, like a paiting, even if there is perspective, it  s not easy to calculate depth. Try to grab a single hair of your head. You  ll probably see your hand get closer and further from ""the line of the mirror"" (where the glass and the reality would meet). Ugh, I was probably not clear enough. Ok, see in Though the Looking Glass when Alice tries to reach the hill. Distance is inverted: close is far and far is close.;If you can think of counter-examples (specially obvious examples, that just pop-up by reading the text, such as word play), then you  re justified to dismiss the essay that ignored those things. One thing is to interprete differently from you, another thing is to ignore what the text itself is saying. If an essay can't see meaning in a literary book, either the author has not read it, or he has not read it. That's what I've said. We are suppossed to be intelligent and attentive readers, if I read a book at full speed and miss the meaning, I'm failing as a reader.  ;Laurie, I finally read your essay! Overall, I liked it very much, i think the metaphor of chess for growing up (from pawn to queen) was well supported by quotes. Maybe some further comparison can be added. For instance, chess is a game, which means there are rules, there is a winner and a looser. What do these things mean if we think it in correlation to growing up? You clearly mark how Alice defends herself against the Queen's questions and demands. Can we read that as a generational struggle? A new generation (represented by Alice who has just been made Queen) that has to fight with the old regimen (Red Queen) in order to get the place to rule. But maybe it's not so simple. If there is a struggle for power, why did the Red Queen explain to Alice the way to become a queen?I'm not so sure about the Harry Potter comparison... Harry is not a pawn, neither he nor Ron or Hermione become ""queens"" and since it's Ron who is deciding the moves, I can't see how the game can be taken as a metaphor for growing-up, like for Alice. You stated that the board is a series of trials and tribulations for Alice, like obstacles we may say. But the whole game of chess is one big obstacle towards the Philosopher's Stone, and it's not structural in the text like Alice's case. (Another detail there, remember to put in italics for the titles of books).If the thesis is that chess not only structures the text but also works as a metaphor for growing up, I think it's proved in your essay and that means it's a successful essay. However, I would be careful with the ending. By talking of the joy of Alice, while it's a colorful, innocent remark, it may be confused with the conclusion. In such a short essay, the conclusion may be found in the very last sentence, and I'm guessing that's how most readers will see it. You don't want people to think your essay was aimed at saying Alice is the most joyful of literature pieces that includes chess.;Stephanie, I liked your essay very much. I think it was interesting, well researched and it did expand my reading of the text. I did find it a little difficult to read, however. Not because of the technical terms, as one of your peers said, but because of other things. I'll try to see if I can identify the problem.-Alice stories could be descibed: described. Obviously, a typo.-There ARE casual models (a mistake found by Laurie too).-changes in 'natural order' into  a scientific world. I don't understand what you meant by ""into"" a scientific world. A world seen by the eye of science would not be ""unnatural"", so I can't see how a change in the natural order relates to scientific world. I supposed you meant to say that these changes respond to scientific theories (because you later talk about Theory of Chaos and so). But the way you put it, it seems ""nature"" or at least ""natural order"" is the opposite to science.-  The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.  I suppose ""this story"" means Alice in Wonderland, although you referred to both Alice's books before as Alice's stories. It's a little variation in the singular/plural form, but it matters. Because in the same sentence you use an ""it"" and a ""this"" whose referent is unclear. Both (changing singular to plural talking of the same thing and an unclear referent) are problems of text cohesion, and I think that's what makes the essay difficult to read. I think the ""it"" had an unclear referent because the previous sentence was  At the time, such changes were rampant and may have seemed random. Is the whole idea of the sentence the ""this"" and ""it"" of the next sentence?  The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.T  he last thing mentioned with ""this"" was ""this story"", so to use ""this"" to point to a previous idea is not the most adequate form.  -  look at Queen of Hearts and the White Queen.  Article missing for Queen of Hearts. The White Queen does have the article.-from seeming silly.  SeemingLY silly. Even if one of your peers disliked the -ly terminations, if they are required, they should be used. Silly is an adjective, and so is seeming. In order to make ""seeming"" modify ""silly"" you have to transform it into an adverb: ""seemingly"".-There are two examples of alternate models of causality that are also suggested. These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant. The first sentence promises the examples, which are never delivered.Why mentioning there are alternate causalities if they are not specified? If they are suggested in Carroll's books, where is that suggestion? If word count doesn't allow you to go into this, don't even mention other models and work on the one you've just talked about (the inversion of sentencing and verdict with the political meaning it portrays). About the second sentence I've quoted from your essay... again there is problem with referents and cohesion. I assume ""his"" means ""Carroll's"". In order to use the possessive adjective, you have to have mentioned the referent (Carroll) not too far away, definitely in the same paragraph. Also, you can't say ""these models"" since you've never said what the models were. Maybe you explained them in a sentence of two that were placed between the two I've copied, and you had to erase them due to having too many words. Remember when you cut things from your work to re-read it to see if it makes sense without the things you've omitted.  -Chaos Theory implies that inital conditions causes differences in outcome.  It's spelled initial, and the verb cause should be in plural (no ""s""), since its subject is ""conditions"".  -Each time, the conditions of where she falls asleep has an effect on how she experiences Wonderland.  Again, conditions is plural, so the verb should be ""have"". Can you remind me the times she falls asleep? I can think of only one, the dream that produces Wonderland. And there would be two with the second book, but then it's not Wonderland there, so there wouldn't be two different experiences of Wonderland. Maybe I've missed a second sleep in Wonderland, if so, please remind me of it.-Should these conditions have changed in the slightest, then the experiece would also be greatly changed. Experience, you've missed the ""n"". Here you're supporting your argument by assuming a change in the story that doesn't happen. That's doesn't make a very strong point. I would have preferred if you compared two specific situations that lead to two very different outcomes just because of a small alteration in the beginning (chaos theory indeed). there isn't a textual example of this in the Alice's books. I would like to provide some, but I honestly can't think of any. I think your other analysis of  quantum indeterminacy is much more supported by the book than this one.-The King and the executioner both argue.  ""Both"" shouldn't be there. An argument already requires two people involved. The situation would be different if they both ""talked about"" something, because they can do it separately.-It would only when they attempt to kill him that it would be known. It would only... and there's no verb! Maybe a simple ""be"" would have been sufficient. Also, for ""it would be known"", I'd change ""it""for something else. You're talking about whether the cat is alive or not. However, you've just used ""It"" for the impersonal first bit of the sentence (""It would only be""). Using two ""it"" in the same sentence to talk about different things is confusing. Try replacing the second one by ""the result"", for instance.-we can interpret that some things follow the laws of probabilty and not laws of causality.  Another typo: probability, you've missed an 'i'. I also wanted to copy the sentence to praise it: the idea is clear and it persuades the reader of your point. In another organization of thoughts, it may as well have been the conclusion: that's the level of clarity and pertinence it has.-It is a  story that attracts us to changes and dismisses them as nonsense as even having a few examples of non-typical causality implies that these changes are as mad as a hatter.  Up to ""nonsense""the sentence makes a lot of sense (ironically). I'd cut it there and then talk about the non-typical causality in a new, final sentence, as an opposition to the ""dismissing"". If the examples are the ones who ""imply"", then it should be ""imply"" and not ""implies"".  That's all! Again, I liked it very much, specially the cat analysis, which I found enlightening. Work on your cohesion and coherence, and you should be fine!;""The red queen explains   to Alice the way to become a queen as a parent would instruct a child. Children grow and challenge their authority figures as Alice starts to stand on her own and challenge the Queens"" I like this explanation :);Glad you've started this thread, Laurie. I'm exhausting from evaluating my peer responses. It took me a lot of time and dedication, and I received under-developed comments in turn. So unfair. I'm not saying all my peers were lazy, but most of them wrote one sentence in Form, forgetting to tell me the mistakes I needed to improve. Content was a little bit more commented, but just about.My essay:It is generally agreed that  Alice in Wonderland  and  Through the Looking Glass  are works of non-sense. The logic that applies in these lands isn't the same as in our reality. Focusing on the subjects of time and space, my thesis is that, while our normal standards don't apply to them, they are still not arbitrary.On the other side of the mirror, things work inversely. Distance (spatial issue) is not reduced when one approaches the object, ""I should advise you to walk the other way""(1). Similarly, the memory of the White Queen refers to the future: an alteration concerning time. To go backwards either in space or time is to go forwards, and the other way around.In Wonderland, Alice goes through numerous size changes. Since size is a spatial aspect, her shrinking or enlarging would be a spatial alteration. A possible significance is that Alice is maturing. The growing up of her body can signify her own growing up as a person. Even if her actual age remains the same, Alice does acquire experience and wisdom in her stay in Wonderland. But the process of maturing isn't straighforward, there are backsteps: she gets bigger and smaller alternatively. Growing up is related to time, but it is represented by a spatial form: size modifications.  Change can lead to question the identity. After saying goodbye to her feet she wonders who she is. After her neck stretches, a bird believes her a serpent. Both are cases of enlargement, and Alice learns on the way (2). Maturing can be unsettling (this strangeness is experienced in the fragmentation and deformation of the body), but in the end she answers to the name of Alice (3).The representation of time and space has its own law in Wonderland and the Mirror Land. In this last one, they adapt to the parametres of the glass: they work ""upside down"". In Wonderland, their relationship is metaphorical (the alteration of size/space means an alteration in maturing/time). In any case, there is no arbitrarism in the non-sense of space and time.Works cited:1.

Comments and grading:FORMeer 1      A very well-written essay, I believe.peer 2      Well written prose that flows smoothly.peer 3      Good structure, you have the point and go on describing it using cited examples. I also like how you ""save the words amount"" by putting sentences in cited work area.peer 4      Your structure makes sense and everything is clear in your text. The only thing that doesn't feel right is how you explicitly say ""my thesis is"" instead of working it into the text.Grade:2CONTENTpeer 1      A very interesting claim! You should have looked for outside references to support your claim, though. Or you should have looked more closely at ONE example in the text.peer 2      I like the way you spell the word ""non-sense"". It seems that we totally agree that Carroll has written some of the most sensible nonsense! Your discussion of space, time and maturation transformations makes a very interesting read.peer 3      You do make good point with Alices wisdom (represented in size), search of identity(""Who are you?"" question from the Caterpillar) analogies. Good examples in order to prove the point. One thing- first sentence is a little bit striking. It is too extreme. I don't think people who ever got to stop and actually think about Alice stories are able to call them ""non sense"". Those must be the ""non attentive students"". So just change the first sentence, think for the ways to show this idea in a more general, objective way. For the rest- very good.peer 4      I really like your thesis. I think it is quite insightful, although I find it a little reducing that you limit the notion of space in Wonderland to body changes. I get that you want to make a point, but I think one could counter-argument your thesis by asking about the spaces Alice travels to in Wonderland and how rooms and pools and gardens seem to appear and disappear. Isn't this arbitrary? Addressing that and defeating the counter argument in advance would have made your essay outstanding.Grade:2.;Laurie, thank you for your comment. Now that I think about it, it was indeed ambitious trying to cover both books.Jae Hee Kim, I understand what you say about working something less commented. I just thought I was going in a different direction by using Alice's growing-up as an argument rather than the conclusion. I still needed to explain it, in case the reader hadn't taken part of the forum discussions concerning the topic.;I think what peer 4 meant was that the opening sentence is an affirmation you're taking as granted, and that you should prove with a quote.;Wow, the idea of Russian dolls where the smallest one also includes the big one (Red King-Alice) is amazing. It is all said in the second paragraph. I think you can add the Dodgson-Carroll level, but, as one of your peer said, stating we are all the Red King may be taking it too far... it's not that it's wrong. I just think it's perfect in the second paragraph and that adding to perfection is impossible, so you'd be falling to imperfection again. Still, I think you could have got more than a 4.;I liked the analysis on the literary devices. One comment, though: mise en abyme is when you have the same structure/plot within itself. The classic mise en abyme is a portait within a portrait.So, when Alice falls asleep, a mise en abyme would be that she dreams she is dreaming (Nemo in Slumberland is this, in fact). Maybe there are examples of mise en abyme in Carroll's books, we just need to look for them.  The metafiction and self-reference are well identified.;I applaude your choice of subject: limited and therefore well-developed. You provide enough evidence to support your thesis, I think this is a very complete essay.;It's so unfair, I feel so outraged by this!I read five essays and wrote down on a notebook my thoughts on them. After watching the unit videos,  I read them again and commented them. It took me three hours to finish.The arithmetic mean of words used in my comments is 509 (I've calculated it). I know it says to leave a comment of 30-150 words, but if it needs to be detailed, I write more. It doesn  t hurt anybody (except me, apparently).The comments I've received are 325 words in total, from four peers, counting form and content (there were no final comments).  It wouldn't be so bad if those 325 words were detailed and specific. But most of them weren  t. So, naturally, I'm very angry.  ;I would prefer people to answer with useful comments, if they can do that in 30 words, I'd be perfectly happy with it. Most of them didn't point a positive and negative aspect, so they weren't following the rules. I've expanded my comments -I'm not asking they should do that, but merely state to the minimum required. What I think it's unfair is that in the end I've done more, and received less.;The fact that ""I did more"" only stresses the injustice of other people ""doing less"": that's the unfair part.Again, I'm not judging size. I counted the words to explain my point in numeric form, because I wasn't going to copy the comments all over (they're in another thread). Glad to hear we agree on the point I've made: thoughtful comments are wanted.;In order to achieve 1.85 of average, you have to have a total of 26 between seven of your best essays.;I can understand you don't relate to Frankenstein. My question is, why do you need to relate to any character to enjoy a book? Maybe that's not what you meant, but it's the impression I got from your first post.  John Graham, I love how you twisted the normal interpretation of the story (which would be the monster is not such a monster... well, what if he is?).;But Van Helsing approached the castle to kill the lady vampires.;Dracula, not particularly erotic? Are we talking about the same book, Bram Stoker's Dracula? I don't know if homoerotic, but most definitely erotic.  ;One correction: it's la petite mort, no noir. Noir is black, mort is death.;I was confused too. I suppose he is 6 years old, and tall for his age. Not older than 9, I'd say.;But were these contradictory comments from the same peer?  It's not unusual to receive different impressions from peers. As someone in another thread said, you can't please everyone.;Both Lucy and Mina open the window for him, so it works like an invitation, even if they do it in a state half-sleeping half-awake.I also want to   check a fact: does Johnathan say he would become a vampire for Mina? that if she becomes one, he would be willing to become one too just to be with her, or something like that. I don't remember that   part...;"

Your thesis seems to be in the first sentence, but I don't understand what do you mean by ""newbie of society"". I know what ""newbie"" means, but I don't get how is it applied to Little Red Cap. You also state other ideas, like the grandmother filling the place of the godmother, but I don't see how it is related to the main point, unless I misunderstood such main point. You have ""thoughts"" about the story indeed, but pouring them all together in an essay without connection makes the essay incoherent.  ;In Spanish we also have two words, one for blue (azul... it's arabic origin, if I recall correctly) and one for light-blue (celeste, although I don't know where it comes from). We also say that the sky is ""celeste"" more than ""azul"", like in Russian. In fact, the flag of Argentina, my country, is ""celeste y blanca"", that is, light-blue   and white, because it is said the sky was the inspiration for it (Think of a cloud strip across the sky and you'll have the Argentine flag).;Uh, I really don't know. I just knew there was a Chinese version, where the tiny feet representing beauty   make more sense, and I thought that was the oldest Cinderella version. I would very much like to know the greek myth.  ;Thank you Amber! I hadn't interpreted Johnathan's words in that sense, but now that I think about it, they do mean he would become a vampire for her.Joseph, I did remark they did it in a half-sleeping state. That doesn't seem to stop Dracula.;He said ""child figure"", so the children Lucy attacks don't really count, they are not characters. A figure would be someone who plays an important role in the text, I think. Like Greg said before, even the wolf was more important.What does catch my attention from the video is that Prof. Rabkin says the children are attacked by Dracula, when we all know they are attacked by Lucy. Dracula would be the ultimate cause, but not the author of the attacks: the bloofer lady. Maybe I heard the video incorrectly, please mark me if I'm wrong.;If Dracula fed on them, why was Lucy covered in blood when they encountered her in her vampire form? And why were the marks on the children's necks smaller? I interpreted that as being made by Lucy, a recent vampire and hence, with smaller fangs than Dracula, THE vampire.;i like your idea Kim, it's convincing.;Um, Anonymous, this is not an essay, it's a forum discussion.;How are they similar?Wormtail is a traitor, he sacrifices his hand for his master, he can turn into a rat (Reinfeld eats rats among other creatures), he owns his life to his master's enemy. I don't see any of this in Reinfeld.Reinfeld venerates Dracula, is confined in an asylum, is obsessed with gaining life, but is worried about souls. He is murdered by Dracula. I don't see any of this in Wormtail.If you only take into account that they are both servants, this item is not enough, because Voldemort has many other servants, all the death eaters. Wormtail doesn't stand out among them, except as the one who helps him re-gain his powers and his body (although again, he's not the only death eater involved in this operation). Dracula, on the other hand, has all his powers when dealing with Reinfeld.;I agree that they are attracted by the power of their master, but once again, so are all death eaters. I understand they don't have to be the same in all the details, but just in one or two key items. The idea of servant that worships the power of his master doesn't seem enough to me, since it's too general.Maybe if you take the Wormtail case just when he's the only death eater by Voldemort's side? That would be between the third and fourth book. If you limit it to just that, it can be justified since Reinfeld is the only assistant of Dracula we know individualized.By the way, I love this discussion and I love that there's debate!;The first point -I agree.  The second, not so much. Lucy as a vampire is seductive, not disfigured. Also, her transformation is caused by an external source (Dracula). Tom Riddle (That is his name in English [and paragraph within paragraph: does Denem mean Riddle in your native tongue? I'm curious]) changes his appearance, but for his own accord.  And three-I also agree.;I get it now;I liked the article and agreed with it except for the last part, where it says that if people don't notice the intertextual references, you've done right. I think it's the opposite. Being able to compare, contrast and acknowledge the different inter-texts enriches the reading, it doesn't spoil it.  ;Cool, I didn't know where Horcrux came from, thank you!Also, vol de mort would be flight from death. It makes more sense :)Voldemort is a Lord but he invented that, Dracula's title is legit. Just a difference I think worth remarking on, because Voldy has humble origins, but not Dracula, who represents aristocracy.;It still makes sense, but I don't know if  more. Voldermort's main aim was to conquer death, so to flee from it would be the most coherent meaning.;It seems we have different views regarding Voldemort. I do think that he sought immortality, not power in itself. I can see it now from your perspective, and it's a valid one. But I still think his goal was to conquer death, not to be the most powerful. I don't agree on the point that he already has immortality when he chose the name Voldemort, nor that he ever achieved it. He had horcruxes, yes, but these could be destroyed, as they were in fact. If he had indeed achieve immortality, he would never had died. He was the one who got the closest to get it, but still didn't have it.  Why I think his battle was against death? Somewhere in his fight with Dumbledore (book 5) he says something like ""there's nothing worse than death"". He lost all his powers -or almost all of them- when he tried to kill baby Harry, but he was not defeated then. His ultimate destruction comes when he dies, not when he is powerless. That's why I state that his main issue was with death, not power.;haha, I thought the same! I told my family, I've just read the story that inspired Poison Ivy! Although I don't know if that's true.  ;It makes more sense that she links the horrible monster described by Johnathan to that apparition in her bedroom, than to link his supernatural apparition to a (true, mysterious) man she saw on the street. It seems she connected the impressions on Dracula (her present impression and her husband's past one) more than Dracula's physical aspect, which by context would differ from the stranger on the street.;How bad people were rude to you. I always point out the mistakes I find, but I've never insulted anyone, in fact, if I mark exactly what the mistakes were, it was with the idea they can be corrected and the person who did them can learn. What a horrible sentence. As you can see, English is not my first language either, but luckily I haven't encounter insults in my corrections (although neither have I found the specific mistakes I've made in form... hard to correct them if I don't know them).;I think the problem with stating your opinion is when you tell if you liked the book or not in your essay, and this is not productive. However, if you take ""opinion"" to be a literary interpretation of the text, then it's ok. How can you tell the difference? By being able to support your statement with textual evidence (quote or indirect citation).  An essay for an intelligent, attentive reader is supposed to widen the interpretation of the book. This will mean you shouldn't summarize the plot, but also mean you must base your affirmations in the literary work, not your assumptions alone.The idea, I think, is that if the reader of your essay later reads again the book, they can interpret it with the key you've provided, and that would produce a new reading. Think it this way: after reading your essay, will my reading of Dracula be altered? I know my reading of Grimm's stories have changed after watching Prof. Rabkin's videos, as Alice's reading has changed after some of my peer essays (two of the ones I reviewed were brilliant). If you can accomplish this, you will have succeeded.That being said, take into account there is a great variety of people here, and just like each of us have a different reading of the same book, it's not unexpected that each peer will have their own reading of your essay. Try to take advantage of all comments and all points of view. Contradictions may help us re-evaluate our parameters of writing and reading, and this, at least, has some value. So I thank you for opening this topic, it's always useful to think things over and not take them for granted.;Laurie, I started to read your essay just now and it sounded familiar to me... I was one of your reviewers! Since this time you haven't post the peer's comments, I can't tell you which one I am. Yours was the first essay I got to review, but I don't know if that means I'm your peer number 1.I'm surprised to see you got your lowest score yet, unless you scored all outstanding before... I gave you two 2s, which I think you deserve.;No, I was the one who commented on the abundance of the connector ""as"".  I don't understand why the other peers gave you 1, maybe the other essays they evaluated were 6s and they tried to compensate? If that's the case, it's really unfair. I graded two 1 this time, both in content. One of the essays didn't talk about the book, and the other interpreted all facts wrong and didn't even linked them to their thesis. These are serious problems in an essay. Yours, on the contrary, did provide with a clear thesis, arguments and a new perspective. It may not be outstanding for everybody, but definitely not worthy of 1.  ;Wow, Laurie, thank you!;Nice and attentive reading, Laurie. My critic on Kasey's essay was going on the same direction: it's a bit reiterative. The  entire  third paragraph could be eliminated, and the essay would still make sense.I think the remark of your peer, Kasey, was really unfair. Just because they decided to work on the same topic doesn't mean the essay doesn't provide with new insights. In fact, if they consider the topic didn't provide anything new, that means their own essay didn't provide anything new, since it's about the same thing.;My essay  In order to defeat Dracula, the characters arm themselves with knowledge. There are of course material weapons as well, but the ultimate weapon against the vampire is knowledge itself. Before confronting him, they investigate his nature. And when they start to chase him, they need to know what path Dracula is taking, if he changed transport, etc. Once they corner him, that is, once they know where he is, they win. There is a physical struggle (against the gypsies more than against the Count), but the victory is already decided.Powerful as it is, knowledge must be handled carefully. First, Van Helsing doesn't communicate his suspicion that they're dealing with a supernatural being to anyone until he is sure that is the case. He veils the information he has, but only to uncover it later to the rest, at what he considers to be ""the right time"". Later, when Mina is under the influence of Dracula, they need to be careful in telling her about their plans, lest the Count should discover them. Information and knowledge are always something to reflect upon before transmitting.Since knowledge is so important, it mustn't be underestimated, in any of its forms. Superstitions here have almost the same status as science, and both are used by Van Helsing. The scientific way would be a procedure of their own class.  Dr. Seward is a specialist, but all of them have the cultural background of the middle-upper class. Superstitions, as beliefs of the common people, would be related to lower class. The result is an interesting inter-class kwoledge, one which takes the superstition material and process it through the scientific matrix.Dracula is frightening as long as he remains a strange, mysterious creature. Once his nature is revealed, he can and is defeated. Knowledge and the recognition of its importance from all sources are   the requirements to destroy evil.  My peer reviewsFormpeer 1      The text is clear, the words are used wisely and there are almost no typos. The only thing that I missed was the use of direct quotes from the book to support your thesis. I know that in this case is a little bit abstract, but it could be used especially when you wrote about the superstitions of common people. Anyhow, well done.peer 2      Minor punctuation error and spelling error, but they don""t detract from the reading or understanding of the paper. Not sure if Dr. was really supposed to be italicized. If it's to emphasize that Seward is a doctor, why not also mention Van Helsing?peer 3      Your grammar, spelling, and word usage are all good. You make a number of very vague statements like ""they arm themselves with knowledge,"" and a number of meaningless statements like ""since knowledge is so important, it mustn't be underestimated."" Overall it's somewhat well written, but it's kind of hard to write a good essay around a thesis that is so vague.peer 4      Spelling, grammar and structure are correct.peer 5      This essay is grammatically accurate and the structure itself is very good. Although there are a few punctuation mistakes in the speech marks area, the rest is good and that note could be a note to be improved on. Overall, an average good form - essay.Grade: 2Contentpeer 1      I understood clearly your thesis and I can relate to it. It's well demarcated in the book the fight between common knowledge and science. The way both have to cooperate to defeat evil it's a clever symbology. I particularly liked when you wrote: ""Dracula is frightening as long as he remains a strange, mysterious creature."" In other words, when people have no knowledge of him, no information, when they are ignorant, that's when Dracula has all the power. This can apply to so many things in our lives and in our world...peer 2      The paper has no clear thesis, which would have helped hone and focus the paper. You talk about knowledge and then you jump to saying that victory is already decided. Many readers would disagree. In addition, you do not explain that point in your body. Why must knowledge be handled carefully in order to get the Count? You don't actually explain that in your paragraph. You also don't explain how they work with superstition of they are all upper-class members of society. You leap over too much info there and lose your reader. How does knowing Dracula's nature guarantee his defeat? You never explain that. It is another leap you make without helping your reader understand your position. Thus, you fail to persuade your reader of the validity of your position.peer 3      It really is not clear to me what you are trying to say. It seems like you're just recapitulating the plot of the story and highlighting places where people use their ""knowledge"" to fight Dracula. Have you ever met anyone who DOESN'T 'use' their 'knowledge?' It's not a bad essay, but the content is practically non-existent. If you had written about the narration style and how the story is told from the perspective of characters with limited knowledge, that could have had decent content. But instead, you don't really say anything of value.peer 4      Good thesis and argument. A few more quotes would be helpful.peer 5      The interpretation is very good and clearly explained, thus deserving a three. This essay could be improved relevance-wise, and if it was stuck to the point more it would be better. Overall, a great and clear piece of writing.Grade: 2Commentspeer 1      As I said before the only thing missing in my opinion is the use of direct quotes from the book. Having said that, I will put here some of the quotes I believe could be of use to your essay: ""...and taking a crucifixfrom her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous,..."" (p. 12) ""But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not - and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am like the rest, ..."" (p. 33) ""Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help."" (p. 43)peer 2      You need to include specific examples and explain your position better. It starts with a clear thesis.peer 3      You write reasonably well, but you should think a little bit more about the essay topic. If you have trouble coming up with a topic, just look it up on the internet. Google: ""Dracula essay topics"" there are hundreds of hits. I realize that time is very limited, especially with a long book like ""Dracula.""peer 5      The content is very good! This could generally be improved grammar wise, since the content is very well written and the interpretation of Dracula is clearly explained. A thumbs up!My thoughts on the peers' commentsFirst of all, thank you, I received thoughtful feedback this time. Thank you for taking the time to write the comments.I'd have liked if they had pointed out the spelling mistakes. By the way, Dr. was supposed to be emphatic, but I take into account the suggestion to mention Van Helsing as well.About the content, I received contradictory feedback, peer 1 found it clear, peer 2 failed to see any thesis at all. I must work on being clearer with stating my thesis, a hard thing to do (I've been marked down for saying ""my thesis is"" in previous essays. The balance is hard to achieve). Peer 3 also had difficult in grasping the point, so again, I should have stated the ideas more clearly.Still, to say that the content is practically non-existent seems exaggerated and harsh.Peer 4 didn't elaborate much, but he did mark a positive and a negative thing. And peer 5 surprised me! A 3! Although that means another peer gave a 1. Was it really so valueless?  What I've learned: include quotes, referring to the book indirectly is not enough. Try to find a way of saying My thesis is without saying My thesis is.;Oh, and particular thanks to peer 1 who took the time to look for useful quotes!;Celine, it absolutely helps. You have clearly explained what went wrong in the essay. I thought that by taking one topic (knowledge) I was reducing the analysis sufficiently, but now I see I should have focused in one point concerning knowledge. Knowledge alone is too much for a 320 word essay.;Tan, thanks for your contribution. I like it as a possible discussion issue, but as you can see from the other comments, the problem was reducing the topic, not enlarging it. If I had expanded with Dracula's use of knowledge, I would have aggravated the problem. I do believe it  s an interesting thing to discuss here, however. Thanks for pointing it out!;Celine, I loved your essay! It was indeed mind-blowing. Things to improve? I suggest the following.>Don't forget to put in italics the title of the book. Particularly in this case, to separate  Dracula the novel from Dracula the character.> In preparation sounds weird... did you mean ""As preparation""?>""Instead""always followed by ""of"".>I don't think the Enoch comparison is well explained. By the Bible quote I only get that Enoch walked by the side of God... how is that like Reinfeld? Maybe it's my own ignorance of the religious text, but I fail to see the connection here.>""Stoker uses the idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christ to add an unfinished note to the story"" You don't really know if it was Stoker's intention, and in the end his intention doesn't even matter. You can point to an unfinished note, but not from Stoker: from your own interpretation, from the essay's development. ""The idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christian results in an unfinished note in the story"", for instance.  > Your peer 2 is right in pointing out that by the end of the book, Mina is no longer stained, the mark on her forehead is gone, and that means Dracula's blood is no longer in her. This doesn't make your argument collapse, but it does require correction. The threat of the vampire resurrection (well remarked in your essay) is cancelled in the end by the erasing of the mark in Mina's forehead.  ;Theo, I liked your choice of topic, it  s quite specific. However, there are possible counter-arguments you should consider: Mina can be seen as the ""New Woman"", something that has been thorougly discussed here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=180Also, Dracula's victims are not all female. Reinfeld is a man. The sailors were men. There was someone else, but I can't recall his name, one who was hired by Dracula to receive the box in a port.  It's not Stoker who makes the point that if Van Helsing hadn't been there... the narrator (who, in any case, would never be Stoker) is never a third person. It was either Van Helsing or Mina who concluded this.  I think that's all!;Hello. No, I don't think the essay was so bad, but there were grammar mistakes. If you wish me to point them, tell me so and I'll do it gladly =)The problem, that may have been due to little practise in writing in English, was that some points were contradictory. For example: ""Such details would normally not be omitted from novels written in the conventional manner, as they are superfluous and not necessary for the progression of the plot."" If they are normally not omitted, why are they superfluous?I thought that an important thing was missing, that later the diaries are read by others and therefore not written for the author of the diary alone, but on a second reading of your essay I realized you did consider this, by stating:  be read by either the writer themselves, or their closed ones. I still think you should have marked this more clearly, how the writing of the diaries would change (or not) once they are meant to be read by the team. But I know there's little space too.;I also do not recommend Google Translator.As for grammar and general form mistakes:>""By choosing to divide the chapters of Dracula into various chapters"". The chapters are not divided into chapters. It would simply be ""By choosing to divide Dracula into various chapters.>Like Sean Tobias noted, it's not immersed, but immerse. Basically, make readers immerse into character's thoughts OR make readers immersed in the character's thoughts. The first is like ""make someone do something""and the second ""make someone something"", that something would be an adjective, hence immersed.  >""the authors of such entries are often (...)  as they knew that..."" Don't change the verb tense.  >Harker's name is spelled Johnathan. You've missed the first h in the fourth paragraph.>If you take away the ""not"" of ""not omitted"", the sentence makes sense.>""Add to"", not into: by adding such intimate details to the novel...>""Bram, by adding such intimate details into the novel, it makes...""  Here you start with a subject (Bram) and then change it (it: it makes...). If you feel that erasing the ""it""after the comma is separating the subject from the verb too much, I suggest moving the clause between commas before the subject: ""However, by adding such intimate details to the novel, Stoker makes..."">You don't close a distance. You can make is smaller, you can reduce it. But ""distance"" is not something open/close, like a door or an issue of discussion.  >You tend to use the word ""by"" to mark cause. While this is not entirely wrong, it sounds weird sometimes. The phrase ""by their nature, diary entries..."" would work better with ""because"". ""By"" is used in the passive voice for the agent, or for a way of doing something: he defeated the vampire by cutting his head, for example. There are other uses as well, but these two were the closest to the idea of cause; I thought of pointing them out in case you were mixing the concepts.>based upon no: based on.  >""diary entries and journals lack the omniscient narrator, and are based upon the memory of the author themselves"" Themselves here is a bit confusing. I suppose you used it referring to author, neither male nor female. However, since you have a plural referent close (diaries and journals), it can be read in that way. Specially since the next sentence says ""their accuracy"" and ""their"" refers to the diaries. I would erase the pronoun ""themselves"" altogether, the idea is clear without it.  > it's just like how human nature is. A subject, even an impersonal one, is always required.>""Precisely due to their imperfect nature and reminiscence to reality, Bram, has succeeded in making the readers feel that the story had really occurred in real life"". If you talk about ""their imperfect nature"" it seems the next subject will be the ""they"" ""their"" is referring to. If it's too confusing, simply change it to ""the imperfect nature"" -you've already stated what is this imperfection and what does it apply to. ""Bram, has"" NEVER. I don't mean to be rude, just emphatic. Never separate subject from verb by a comma. And since he's making the readers feel, i'd say it's ""that the story has really occurred"". The past perfect is only used to mark a past action that happened before  a previously mentioned past action. Basically, if you don't have a past simple or continous before, don't use past perfect.  >""make them feel more for the trials"" make them feel more what? Sympathetic? Horrified? Sad?  You need an adjective.  That's all I've seen. As I'm not a native speaker, I can have missed other things, or judged the mistakes wrongly. But I tried to justify each correction. Hope this helps, please remember it's not meant to be rude, but to help you improve on your English :);Interesting indeed. I agree with peer 1 here ""man, as unevolved, conquers vampire, as evolved, which is directly contrary to Darwin"", except it  s not contraty to Darwin. I just think the essay needs to cover this point: if Dracula is ""more evolved"", what does it mean that he is defeated in the end? Evolution as a series of changes doesn't automatically mean the survival of the ""last one to transform"". The fittest may be one who hasn't ""evolved"" or changed. Darwin's theory talks about a struggle to survive, and changes are experimental, they may work or not. Dinosaurs didn  t. I also feel compelled to remark that peer 1 made this comment in ""Form""... out of place.Peer 5 final comment was the most attentive one, we all can learn from him/her.  ;Well, a 3 stands for outstanding. It doesn't mean perfect grammar and syntax, that would still be a 2. I think a 3 in form is the hardest to achieve. I have only graded one 3 in form last time, and it was superb. I mean actually outstanding, it looked like a literary author had written it. It was catchy, fluid, it was absolutely pleasant to read.  ;Claire, it seems your peer 2 didn't read your essay ""focused on one episode"". Just because you start with one episode, but there is another mentioned: Mina as a God's woman. Even if there was only one episode, it is possible to make an essay analysing just that.  While I was reading it, I also felt it was diverted, but since you connect all the arguments in the end, it's a complete work.  ;This is very common in literature. The oldest ""nested story"" I can think of is A thousand and one Nights. Also, at the top of my head,  The Golden Ass, Wuthering Heights, and Ethan Frome.Cloud Atlas (a book I highly recommend) is described as a set of Russian dolls, because you have many stories within stories. And it gets more complicated, because there are links between the narratives, threads of meaning, patrons that repeat throughout the book.  Jeremy, what do you mean by the monster's great great grand-daughter hidden in the core of the book? I've read Cloud Atlas, but it's been some months, and maybe I forgot the reference.;Ahhh, got it. Yes, from that perspective I can see it.  ;Why Christ against Marie Magdalene? I don't see how they're antagonists.I also can't see how the gypsies can be seen as apostles. Jesus taught lessons to his apostles, Dracula hired gypsies to carry him around. There were affectionate bonds between Jesus and the apostles; Dracula is egotistic and works alone.;Hello, Javier. Maybe you haven't noticed there's already a thread on this, under the assignments part of the forum.

He has been naked all along. The notion of fertility appears here because Adam and Eve realize they are naked, nakedness is linked to sex, and therefore, to reproduction. So, the disobedience would be leading to this particular form of gaining power.""Because we dont know for sure what would have happened had Adam not been cast out of the garden, he probably would have had more kids and of stronger form (had he obeyed)"" how can you state we can't be sure of something and then make an assumption of it? It's true that there is no way of knowing, I as well may believe he couldn't have had any children at all. After all, the first mention of  labor  (woman having children) happens as a punishment for the disobedience.I do agree on your analysis of Cain. The fact that he would live forever is no reward, but a punishment, since he won't be able to enter Paradise. Cain is punished for his disobedience.The eating of bread as cannibalism... it is linked, at least in a literal reading. But just as you can interpret the passage metaphorically, you can take the cannibalism metaphorically as well, as a communion for instance. But you can't ignore the cannibalistic sense: it says ""eats the bread, for it is my body"", so if the bread is his body and he's compelling them to eat it, he's compelling them to it him. (I didn't quote it directly from the Bible, I don't even have an   Bible in  English, so if I'm too far away from the text, please correct me).;There is a bit of a contradictio in the Bible concerning Adam and Eve's immortality (I do not mean to offend here). Apparently, they become mortal once they sinned and cast out from Eden: death comes as a punishment in The Fall. But God also says that if they had eaten from the tree of Life, they would have become immortal like him... so that means they weren't immortal to start with.  ""As for the cannabilism linked to the story of Jesus imagine we live in a world where everything is taken literally, well that would have been a total mess"" I didn't say you should take it literally, I said it is always a possibility, you can't erase the literal meaning, so you shouldn't ignore it. That means you can't say there is absolutely no link with cannibalism.  ;??

Specially the Aubepine analysis.I can see the Rapunzel reference inverted (going down instead of up), but I don't get why there are echoes in the name. Do you mean the title ""Rapaccini's daughter""? Or Beatrice's name?;Ah, OK, I thought Rapaccini came from ""rampion"" in italian, or something like that. I've just looked it up (in Google, I'm so lame), and ""rampion"" is ""raperonzolo"" in italian. In any case, there is the connection in the plants: Rapunzel is named after a vegetable, and Beatrice Rapaccini is well connected to plants, since her birth. The origin of both is green. :P;hahah, ok, thanks again for your contributions :);Walton too? But then, how did you explain the letters to Walton's sister? Frankenstein doesn't even read those.;But how do you support this theory? For example, it is possible that the monster never existed because there weren't many witnesses apart from Frankenstein himself: this fact is in the text itself. what element or elements in the letters make you think they are invented? if you imagine Victor made up the whole thing, why not imagine he's not Victor at all? Check Greg's Fishbone comment.  I don't mean to be rude, I just think that if you question something in a book, you should have a basis for it, specially if it's an essay and not just an idea casually suggested in a forum.;Interesting outcome, Andreja.  I'm a little confused at the structure. The first paragraph details the story  too much. By simply stating that Victor was under stress and with deteriorated health when he created his monster you would have provided the same idea, without using so many words. Contrastingly, the second paragraph seems to be interpreting some ideas, without explaining so much where do they come from: for instance you say ""He blames the books he read in his formative years for his madness"". Where is that said on the book? If you interpret it that way, you should justify it.  I'm wondering, did your peers noted this too?;This comment was much more interesting and enriching than any of the 6 essays I've read so far.I don't actually agree with you on the final point about the issue being outdated, but before that you make some very persuasive remarks. The analysis if eros and thanatos was amazing! You could write an essay just on that, and it would most definitely be worth a 3 for content.;It's a good idea, but there's a problem with it. The essays we do here concern books we've all read. You have to have the unit's readings ready when looking at a peer's essay. If we do an essay about any other book, you risk the chance that the person hasn't read it at all, and therefore, you would have to waste a lot of space in telling the basic things, or that they have already read it, in which case they would get bored with a plot re-telling. If your aim is to suggest new readings, why not try this thread:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=92? And if you have more books to recommend that don't fall in the category of fantastic, well,you can always open a new thread.  Maybe you could put one book per comment, along with a short essay/analysis afterwards? So those who have already read the book can take a look at the essay and comment it below.That would enable the writer of the essay to suppose a knowledge of the text just like our essays on the units of this course.;I can't believe it, Laurie, I reviewed another one of your essays! It was the first non-obligatory essay I graded. I'm the peer who said ""Good job :)"" in the final comments section.My essay   You have made me wretched beyond expression   . This is said by the monster to his creator. Excuse me, the other way around. The inverse accusation does occur, with different words:    All men hate the wretched, how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!    The emphasis (beyond expression/all living things) is put on the misery suffered: the word wretch appears in both discourses. Moreover, it is the term Walton (the only one who meets both monster and creator) uses to describe Frankenstein (1) and the monster (2). The relationship between Victor and his creation can be read in the usage of this word.Wretch  can either mean someone miserable, worthy of sympathy or an unpleasant, evil person. Both meanings are present in different forms of the term.    Wretch    the noun appears more associated with the second meaning, whereas    wretched    the adjective is more linked to the first.   The pair of meanings has a common core: they can be thought as    causing unhappiness    and    caused unhappiness   , noun and adjective respectively.Up to the first half of the book, when the main voice is Frankenstein   s, he himself is wretched. His unhappiness precedes the creation of the monster: when obsessed with his laboratory practices, he   s is not merry. And the arrival of the daemon    the evil one- only makes him more miserable. The first construction has the monster as the wretch and Victor as the wretched.But then, it   s the monster   s time to speak, and in his tale he is the offended:    what a wretched outcast I was   .   His accent is put into awaking pity in his listener, like Victor with Walton. Later, the monster insults Frankenstein by calling him    wretch   , reversing the first construction. Which one is the right one?The wretched man creates a wretch.  Because  he neglects him, and causes him misery, the creator is the wretch himself and his creature, wretched. The circle closes: the monster   s actions make Frankenstein wretched. The two constructions are not just two points of view; they complement and explain each other.  Works cited1)              His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.    pg 265.2)                 Wretch!

Peers' reviewsFORMpeer 1      It seems this assignment allows each of us to submit our writing quickly without editing and rewriting. I was able to pick up some good thoughts from your essay, but I'm sure they would have been easier to understand after one rewrite by you.peer 2      Your essay was an absolute pleasure to read. Its form is near flawless with well-structured sentences, supportive and concise paragraphs, and an interesting tone. I think your tone is what I'll choose to highlight here as it's an intriguing mix of conversational and formally analytical. That's hard to pull off, but you certainly have. I only find one mistake (""he's is"" in 3rd paragraph) and I'm pretty sure it's just a typo rather than a usage error. So I guess my suggestion for improvement would be a more careful proofread before submitting :)peer 3      All good.peer 5      The exposition and argument are very clearly laid out. There may be a few awkward phrasings, but overall good form.Grade:2CONTENTpeer 1      There is certainly an interesting juxtaposition between the monster and his creator - each sometimes the victim, sometimes the villain. It was interesting to identify the term ""wretch"" as symbolizing this.peer 2      Very interesting look at wretch/wretched! Your analysis and support absolutely serve the assigned purpose of enriching the thinking and reading of your fellow student. I think in less capable hands this thesis may have been a more limited vocabulary study, but your writing kept it closely tied to and deepening of the text. I'm afraid I won't be helpful in offering suggestions for improvement, because I think you should just keep doing what you've done here, making interesting connections and writing about them in a friendly yet informative tone. I think starting with a quote is quite effective for this piece, and all the quotes you use are seamlessly integrated.peer 3      Interesting argument with mightily interesting angle of evidence by using the word play wretch and wretched. Well thought out.peer 5      This argument is very interesting and provides some significant insights. My only hesitation is that it seems to me that wretch is usually used in the sense ""someone who is miserable"" and wretched as ""someone who feels miserable"" -- at least in modern English. That may not be the case in the English used at the time of Mary Shelley. Nonetheless, I think this essay provides a useful and insightful argument.Grade:2Well, I'm a little dissapointed with the comments. Unlike last time, there wasn't much detail about what I did wrong or needed to improve. Peer 2 did provide feedback, but 4 never appeared and 3 didn't feel like writing much. I still don't understand why peer 1 thought I hadn't read the essay before submitting it. He/she didn't provide any example for this impression.;Thank you very much, Jeremy, that was really helpful!I thought about the wreck thing, but since the essay space is scarse and I was marked down before for not being focused enough, I decided to stick with just wretch.I particularly appreciate your etimology dictionary link, I love etimology!;Sean beat me to it, I was going to point out that if you got all 2s and the average wasn't 2.5, they must make it approximate to 2.  As to giving feedback on my essay, do as you please! I would like yo know your general opinion, but I wouldn't demand a thorough examination.If someone corrected your   its   of ""its bonds"" to ""it  s"" they weren't paying attention to your essay, so don't take their remarks into consideration. People can be so lazy at reviewing...;Not late at all, it was helpful indeed. You illuminated me about the passive voice: in Spanish, we are encouraged to use it (or a variety of it) in academics essays. By the way, it's passive voice, not tense ;)I'll keep in mind the rest of the corrections too.;I don't know of any. Find an impopular thread, maybe :);I've also compared Birthmark with Oval Portrait! I hope we'll get to see different things and so enrich each other. The comparison I've thought was part of a larger theme (art and life), where I talked about ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""Rappaccini's daughter""as well, but I had to reduce it... it was too much considering four short stories.;I think it's OK, but I prefer after the evaluations close because you can post your peer's reviews as well.;haha Sean, you're hilarious!You didn't misinterpreted me at all. In fact, I understood Laurie's comment after your clarification.  The main Mexican what is named Santa Ana? If you don't mind me asking.;There is so much about the history of Mexico (and other countries for that matter) that I don't know! Thanks for the info.;Well, the form is a little ""shaky"", but the essay is readable. What peer 1 remarked I think can be solved by simply changing the order: ""by creating life themselves"". There were some puntuation mistakes (no comma in ""He demands, what all humans want""), spelling (""They sepend [spent] their last days""), grammar (""he shows that there's [are] no boundaries"").As to content, there were one or two details that you got wrong, such as the ""eponym"" referent, or the fact that Frankenstein is not a Doctor, the chasing each other at the end (Victor chased the monster, but not the other way around. Not in their final days, at least). Otherwise, the analysis of the inverted paralelism of Frankenstein and his creature seems all right to me.  ;I think your peers have said it all. The main problem was that it was unfocused. I found the gender role analysis to be very interesting. It would have been nice to have seen it developed.  ;I think the idea of the parent-child relationship is very interesting and well spotted. However, the essay doesn't do much more after pointing out the abandonment. The new insights I get from this are the fact that the abandonment doesn't reduce itself to the case of Victor and his creation, and that the destruction of the monster bride can be seen as an abortion. What goes in between these two ideas isn't much. And while these thoughts have a common topic, they are not related towards a main idea, a thesis that should be analysed or proved.  My advice is, first of all,  pay more attention to form. ""I found the parent-child relationships..."" You find something to be of a certain nature, for example: I find your essay interesting/plain/deep, etc. An adjective is wanted there.  Secondly, watch out for repetitions. ""he does not want to bring another creature into the world. This is reason some women seek out abortions, because they do not wish to bring a child into the world and raise it."" If an idea is clearly stated, then there is no need for repetition.  And finally, organize your ideas towards a clear end. You have some very interesting ideas, and I'm sure you can do this.;Awesome essay! So sad you didn't receive enough feedback, I'd be outraged if I were you.Regarding form: it is generally smooth, but there are in fact some issues to work on. ""influence of her parents"" influence on, not of. ""  Initial there is"" Initially. ""  As with the revolutionaries"" Like the revolutionaries. You can construct a comparison with ""as"", but scratch the ""with"", otherwise it seems like saying ""concerning the revolutionaries"".Regarding content: I think it was a very well thought comparison, and well justified as well. You base your analysis on Shelley's parents, but focus on the novel, not Mary's life: bravo. There is one arguable point, however: ""In the end, the ideals of the Revolution burnt out"". This is not true. The French Revolution has consequences even nowadays, it was a turning point in the History of Humanity. There is a before and after the Revolution. Even if there was indeed a drawback to ""the traditional fold"", it was never the same.I'd have graded it a 3 in form without a doubt.;You manage to support your thesis properly. But there could be counterarguments. Frankenstein isn't the only one who finds his creation repulsing. Think of the villagers he encounters, think of Felix, Agatha and Safie. But the monster does mantain a conversation with blind DeLacey. What can this mean? Do eyes deceive about real beauty? Are eyes an opposite symbol then from the traditional eyes>knowledge? Interesting topic to discuss about.;Hi, Jeremy, I liked your essay and found it interesting. I sincerely don't understand your peer 4, who commented about grammar in ""Content"", and didn't even justify his critic. Don't let this bother you and continue with your good work!;I've used quotes in the cited work section since essay n  2 and have never been marked down for it. I was even complimented on that once!;Interesting take into the monster's readings. Maybe you described these readings more than you analyzed them. I feel like the conclusion ""They result in the extraordinary eloquence, sentiments and understanding"" doesn't follow the argumentation, it is just presented and not so well explained. Maybe I'm reading it too fast. In any case, I can make a suggestion concerning form: (suggestion, not correction) use more connectors. The third paragraph comes a little disenganged, a connector just before ""Empathising with Werter he weeps"" and ""He manages to put humanity into perspective"" would make the text more fluid.;Yes, I thought about re-writing some of my essays, the ones I'm not happy with.;The discordance in the video also caught my attention. Because the Professor says ""Sydney"", but when the poem appears on screen it says by Edmund Spenser.;Querido An _nimo, soy hablante nativa de espa  ol, as _ que intentar   revisar el texto que posteaste reci  n, y despu  s comentar   sobre la evaluaci _n de los ensayos.""I go several trials I've done"" No se entiende.

Lo que sigue lo parafrasear _a ""From this I understand/get/interpret that the gradings are assigned taking into account just that part and not along-with the central thought(s)"" Record   que en ingl  s el adjetivo va antes que el sustantivo y que no existe concordancia de n  mero, as _ que nunca ser _a centrals despu  s de thoughts.""[I'm not trying to complain or even justify] the humble ""4"" or ""3"" I've bee given"" O si quer  s conservar el impersonal, ""It's not a complaint...""

Like they rival in energy, they rival in depth. The ""and"" is not linking two adjectives for ""energy"", but two nouns.;If you're worried about this, think it this way: you need 26 points in 7 essays to pass.26/14 (seves essays would mean 14 grades) = 1.85;I agree with Anna, the logic may be immoral, but it's not without any justification that the narrator kills the old man. What strikes me from his cause of murder is that it is similar to the cause of his own condemnation: the overacuteness  of the senses. The eye (visual) bothers him and he kills, then the beating (sound) torments him, and he confesses. The root of both is an hipersensibility, like Usher's. Even if you argue the beating is in his head (because we knoe the dead heart doesn't make any sound), they way he feels his guilt is through sound.;When it says we should seek counter-arguments, it means we should test the thesis. If you don  t find counter-arguments, then it  s a safer thesis. Seeking counter-arguments would be defending yourself against possible critics, because a counter-example may be pointed out by some peer. You shouldn't include counter-examples in your essay, unless you can explain them, but if you find some, you may want to revise your thesis.;I think it's meant to call your attention. If you see a thread or post with many points, you'll probably want to read it.  ;Same thing happened to Anna and me; we're discussing it here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=614;Maybe we have the same essay to review: I  m reading one on the Masque of Red Death right now. I decided to come here as well and discuss the matter.  One of the other essays I have compares the Tale-Tell heart to one of Hawthorne  s stories that are not included in the course. Since the Tail-Tell Heart is included, I let it pass. It's not different from comparing some of the unit's readings to another work, be this the Bible or Don Quijote, or whatever.But if it's ONLY about the Masque of Red Death... I  m sorry, but I think the person has failed to complete the requirements for the assignment: they didn't discuss the unit's readings at all. If in unit 4 I had analyzed Mathilda by Mary Shelley, I bet I would have been graded a 1 in content.;Why except those? Why isn't a comparison with any literature work valid?;Yes, it  s hard to judge what should be ""assumed knowledge"", as Emma put it. Because the course supposes inteligent, attentive readers, but intelligent doesn't mean widely read. One can be highly intelligent and haven't heard of Greek myths. I'd draw a line in the texts quoted or referred in the videos. If Professor Rabkin has already discussed The Fates, for instance, then I can name them without explaining the whole story.  ;I agree, wikipedia is not academic-like, but it's not so grave.;I agree, they shouldn't take for granted that everyone knows that story. Even if it is widely known, but specially if it isn't. If Hawthorne's most known work is The Scarlet Letter, I understand you can omit certain pieces of information about it, but if you talk about a short story...chances are the reviewer hasn't read it.;it is clarified in the before you read video of the unit.  ;Mm, didn't God forbid them to eat from the Tree of Knowledge only? I think he didn't even mentioned the Tree of Life, so Adam and Eve didn't know it had effects like the other one.;"

Not always the case, I'm afraid.  In last unit I graded some 3 (either in form or content). Sadly, I had none in this unit.  ;Javier, I agree with the general comment that your essay focused too much on Poe and not so much on his stories. I wish to have seen more textual analysis.  As I starting reading your peer's reviews, peer 1 response sounded familiar to me. We must have got the same peer because   HE WROTE THE SAME WORDS TO ME, BOTH IN FORM AND CONTENT. I'm so sorry, but that means the person wasn't reviewing the essays at all. If you take a closer look, you'll see that his comments are too general and never speak of your or my particular essay: they can be applied to any essay. SHAME ON YOU PEER 1. (He was my peer 1 as well).;I like how it proposed a different reading than the usual, but it's true there are several grammatical mistakes that may difficult the reading of the essay. If you want to, I can do my best to point them out... I'm a bit lazy right now.;I agree with what Martha said about peer 3 and 4 balancing each other, and I think the right view is in the middle point of their comments (in my opinion). Like the rest here, I didn't feel like the quotes were too much or that they were on the way of the analysis. But I do think you lacked further development. Even if you don't simply summarize, you spend a lot of words re-telling the parts of the story you want to highlight, and there's not much space left for your own thoughts. The idea of Nature vs Science is a clear theme, as you say, and worked fine as a starting point. But you need to develop further/deeper, not simply stating in different words what was  already  clear in the introduction.It is, of course, a very well done essay, particularly in form.;Your essay isn't like any other I've read... the very definition of outstanding! You deserved a 3 in form without a doubt. If must have taken you a lot of time and effort. Bravo.Regarding content, I have to say that part suffers the geniality of the form. There is not much new analysis, just a comparison of two stories in the surface. Still, you managed to say something, so it wouldn't be worth a 1, but a nice 2 that means approved!;Oh, I think a conclusion can be poetic! And as long as there is textual support, it will be correct. Anonymous, remember it's supposed to be an interpretation, you don't have to agree with it, you have to judge whether it's consistent with the argumentation and relevant to the course's readings.;Uuu, I loved this essay! It certainly enriched my readings! But whereas it talked about an outside concept, it kept coming back at the literature. Complete success.  I don't think you needed a title, and even when the first person singular at the end was somewhat out of the blue (I doubted if it was a comment you added here on the forum or part of your essay), I think it works just fine and I would most definitely not mark it down.;The Women in Refrigerator's Syndrome doesn't really apply to two of the three stories you cited. If the idea of killing a woman is to ""further the plot"" as you said, how come both ""Rappaccini's daughter"" and ""The birthmark"" end with the death of the woman? I agree there is sexism in killing the woman, but I don't think it's explained by this particular syndrome you tell us about. It can work with ""Dr. Heidegger's experiment"", though. If you had only analysed that story, the essay would have been correct.  And I don't think considering the narrator in ""The Black Cat"" a male is ""male default"" (although this phenomenon does occur in many other ways, and a lot), because it is said the narrator has a wife. No gay marriage in Poe's time, so the narrator is doubtlessly a guy.;Risky form, and as you can see, some people find it great and other people disapprove. I like it, but just like with many cases where the form stands out, the content is left out. You do arrive at a conclusion (the heart of the title is not the old man's, but the narrator's), but the arguments don't necessarily lead there, simply beacuse there are no arguments but an attempt to reason with a madman. Again, I think this idea of talking not to the reader of the essay but to the narrative work you're presumably analysing (or its narrator) is very original and should be congratulated. But then you run the risk of lacking argumentation, which was the main problem here. I still think your essay was a successful one, and I would have graded you 3 in form and 2 in content.;The only correction regarding form I would make is not in fact a correction as a suggestion: always put the book titles in italics. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818). I assume you mean the book, not the character, since you referred the year and have put it along Hawthorne's works, not characters.  And the other thing I'd comment on is that Aylmer is not described ""as having a    love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy.   "", but the times when he lived are described with those words. I don't think it invalidates your point at all, but I think precision is needed.Oh, and answering your peer who suggested that instead of Shelley you could have analysed Poe: I don't agree. In Poe, the artist falls under the same fate as the scientists in Hawthorne: in ""The Oval Portrait"" the woman dies because of the painting.  ;I liked it very much, it offered a solid comparison. An article is missing in the opening sentence ""[The] beautiful garden..."" same with ""[the] creative efforts of a man"". Also, ""feel"" is just a verb, not a noun, so it should be ""along with the feel[ing]""""  Beatrice's unnatural talents, and the way Giovanni appears to be lured into the garden makes us associate her with a poisonous snake. Indeed, akin to an animal, her deadly ability is only a natural instinct she cannot be held accountable for, while her inner nature is pure."" Loved this. I felt I had to compliment as well as critisize and this part was particularly good, both in form and in content.  Great essay.;My essayBoth ""The Oval Portrait"" and ""The Birthmark"" end by telling of the death of the female protagonist, and the responsible for this is her husband, obsessed with his work. The woman rivals with the obsession (1) and looses, but at least ""the loss"" from this perspective takes the female figure as an active subject. Actually, the actions of the husband put the woman in a rather passive place.The action that results in death is scientific on one side and artistic on the other, but both of them deal with the concept of beauty. When the woman is seen under this restricted point of view, she becomes an object. Aylmer considers her wife as a matter to be moulded, like Pygmalion with her sculptured woman, and treats her like any other experiment. Even worse, the painter trasforms the image of her wife into a painting; the object here is tangible.This concern for the beautiful taken to the extreme links death to perfection: the perfect complexion, the perfect portrait. It was not enough for Aylmer that his wife was beautiful, she was to be perfect, just like the portrait simply resembling the model wasn't sufficent, it had to be Life itself. Nevertheless, this perfection is reached by different means. While the scientist erases an imperfection (negative work), the painter adds brushes and tints (positive work). Even if by doing this, he is drawing the life out of his wife, the action that concerns the canvas is by addition, not sustraction. When there is sustraction like in ""The Birthmark"", the result is a reduction: one life lost. On the contrary, the operation by addition results in a ""more"", and a ""less"" that compensates it: the portrait in exchange for the life. In Hawthorne we only have death (-1), but in Poe we have death and a new creation (-1 +1). There isn't a profit in any case. All the concepts are related: this economic analysis derives from the vision of woman as object or property.  Works cited:1. Poe: ""hating only Art which was her rival""; Hawthorne: ""it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman"".  >>>I was expecting critics on the structure and maybe an unclear thesis, although I assumed that anyone who could take the time to read it carefully could understand all points perfectly well. This was not always the case:Peer reviewsFORMpeer 1      The essay is well structured and easily read, attributing to its form.

That was something I didn't consider when reading those two stories, but in retrospect it makes total sense.Thanks to all who found the essay interesting or useful. The positive criticism is encouraging. I wish the negative one would have been more constructive.;Thank both for your comments. Loose and lose is something I've always had trouble with. Let's see if this time I can learn it properly.With ""women rivals with ---> women are rivals of"" I think you must have read the sentence too quickly, because it says ""woman"" not ""woman"", so the ""-s"" is appropiate. Rival is used as a verb, not a noun.I clearly didn't know how to write substraction and inserted a spanglish term there... oops.  And you're of course right about ""protagonist"" and ""character"".  ;Emmanuelle and Daniel, it is possible I reviewed both of your essays.

The one on the Masque of Red Death was really interesting, I don't know if it was yours, Emmanuelle, but I did comment that it was a shame the author hadn't analysed one of the stories in the syllabus.For the essay that compared Poe and Hawthorne I didn't mark it down, because Poe's story was in fact listed.Like William said, there was a thread discussing this very same topic, but even before that one, there was another that asked which short stories we had to read for the unit:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=527;Emmanuelle, yep, I was your peer 1.

I want to explore in explicit detail the subject that I am totally passionate about.

Kudos to her for standing up for what she believes in or doesn't believe in despite all the adversity. This is my first Coursera course, but I am an art student and we do peer evaluations all the time at my normal school. In fact, for every project. I think everyone puts a lot of effort into the evaluations. Sometimes, we take an entire four hours to discuss the finished projects of us ten students. Our teacher, I'm sure, takes what we have to say into consideration, but he makes the ultimate decision when it comes to a grade. I know that's not possible with thousands of students, but it seems like there could be a better way to make a class like this work.From a grading standpoint, I worry about how to grade a 16 year old who is still learning what a thesis is and then turnaround and grade a 75 year old retired professor, whose written six academic books in his life. Furthermore, with all of the speakers who have English as their second, third, or fourth languages, I worry that I might not be able to distinguish a sophisticated idea because I'm distracted by the spelling or grammar or what have you. I feel that I could learn a lot from my peers through comments and I feel that I could help others out, but I'm not sure it is a just system where strangers of a variety of ages and academic levels and skills decide, points wise, whether another student passes or fails.Also, I just wanted to make a point about those who post Anonymously.

What I was trying to say is that there are many more people writing today than there were before, so it seems like there's a bigger percentage ;I've never read that, but I wrote it down on my list, thanks. Yeah, I'm not always the best at expressing my thoughts in words, either, so, no harm done. I totally agree about ebooks, btw. I've read some that actually have decent plot lines, but the writing is terrible (not just riddled with errors, but very juvenile, and that's being nice).;Hi Sean,I agree, it makes for a great discussion! :)  In the case of Frankenstein, I often consider the time period it was written (early 19th century) and the place (London). That was an interesting time indeed, when early advancements in science still intermingled with many of the old-world views of magic, the occult, etc. Romanticism was on the rise (which sought to critique both the Industrial Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment). One might think of it as an in-between period, a phase connecting the supernatural/alchemical/magical paradigm that came before with the technological/scientific/materialist paradigm that we are in now. Perhaps because so many things were in flux and transition, this is why it is difficult to define the genre of Frankenstein with such hard and fast rules? Gothic Horror might be one category. Fantasy (of the Romantic period) might be another. Science Fiction might be another. Perhaps they are all correct?  ;wow you guys good thoughts, Just a thought how many of our good fantasy/science fiction authors were under the influence like Edgar Allen Poe, who drank?   Ancient ancestors came up with fantastical creatures under the influence of 'shrooms,   when did man start adding in depth references to sex, to their oral/morality stories?   When did others start seeing these subliminal ideas?;Greg, I love your read of Six Soldiers. That made me laugh in my morning oatmeal. And funny as it is, it is a viable reading....;The expectation is that you'd read all of them for the course. Other translations/editions have many more (or different) stories; the Crane edition is the particular set of stories we're focusing on. Happy reading!;Nice answer. I learned something from that. Thanks!;I agree with you, William, and thanks for writing it. I couldn't seem to get the words out in a way that made sense. I shouldn't post at bed time.The question of fairy tale vs myth has been sloshing around in my brain. There is a clear difference. I was going to mention American Gods but decided that was more myth.... Disney hits up the fairy tales, more often... I'll have to look into if there is much adult-oriented fairy tale re-writing.  Anyone seen Grimm (isn't that what the TV series is called?). I haven't, but it seems that based on the name that would be worth a watch. We'll see.;Magical Realism, as I understand the term, is more subtle than urban fantasy. This is my personal interpretation, anyway. Magical Realism is where ""impossible"" things happen but no one blinks an eye - or just accepts that this is expect-able (yes, I just made up that word). ""The House of the Spirits"" by Isabel Allende would be an example - as, I think, much of the writing by Haruki Murakami (""Kafka on the Shore"" and ""The Wind-up Bird Chronicles,"" for example). These don't quite fall into the realm of fantasy (though maybe someone could make the case for Murakami edging toward fantasy... I don't think so...) but clearly they aren't ""real."" Special people see or talk to spirits, or know things, or talk to cats, or make journeys into pockets of other-worldliness, but they mostly live in the world as we know it. They just have some special rules that the rest of us don't necessarily experience.I haven't read much urban fantasy (I am thinking Neverwhere, American Gods (?), and something set in the Seattle Underground but I can't remember for the life of me the book... something about a devil.....), but my thought is it's basically gritty fantasy set in a ""hidden"" part of a city... kind of Alice-in-Wonderland like? Gotta take a trip through a rabbit hole to get there?But that's just conjecture.....;I wonder if a ""fairy tale"" by definition is a tale that has centuries of telling behind it? I'll have to chew on that. I don't know that there is a hard and fast definition of fairy tale, actually. I just did a quick search and found a wide variety of descriptions of what a fairy tale is.... how would you define it?That said, there is a large body of work out there using fairy tales (or myth....) fast-forwarded into modern times.  ;I was just doing some reading about the history of these tales, and found that even the Grimm brothers changed/sanitized/adjusted the tales for a variety of purposes. They published multiple editions in their life time, with a wide variety of religious adaptions, for example.... so it's not just translations but initial editions, too. I think the tales themselves are not a reliable record of what was actually passed from generation to generation.Interesting:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms'_Fairy_Tales;Interesting comment, Shaun. I've been thinking about the tales and how they reflect a peoples' thoughts on authority (maybe specifically royalty?) - and it made me think of red shoes, in general. Once, kings wore red heels (yes... HEELS!). So one could read Grethel's red heels and her subsequent ""great airs"" as a royal reference.  I've been tossing around this idea in re: the essay that's pending, and your comment helped me make some connections. Thanks!;I find myself increasingly interested in references to royalty, specifically stories that indicate an uneasiness with/distrust of royalty.  Six Soldiers of Fortune clearly has a king's untrustworthiness as a core element of the story. Clever Grethel has red heels, which makes me wonder if she's a stand-in for royalty (and she certainly steals and covers her theft through trickery); also, the red silk in The Death of the Red Hen may be relevant. These are just a few allusions and I haven't finished thinking about this.Of course not all tales involving kings or royalty qualify... but some seem to lean that direction.Anyway, any thoughts on this? If many of these stories are rooted in the experiences of the ""common man,"" then it seems that some tales would reflect an ambivalence toward those in power.;I wonder if the idea of ""common royalty"" is as oxymoronic as you think... once upon a time, kingdoms were small and plentiful... so the idea that there would be multiple realms (and multiple kings) close to one another isn't all that far-fetched...;The idea of royalty as a parallel to modern celebrity is intriguing...  ;The way women live within these tales is a huge part of why I dislike them so intensely. I understand historical importance, a part of the times, etc...but that doesn't mean that I have to like it. I'm thinking hard, but is there ever a ""warrior woman"" in here? Even the best of the women in these stories are at the mercy of men.  Not all ""classic"" folklore has women wordlessly agreeing to marriage simply because they were asked.....;The Raven is a good example, though this story, too, has a girl wordlessly marrying a king because he likes her looks...I think originally these tales were told by men and women. Yet they were collected by men, and subsequently rewritten by men.... so I would consider that they are heavily influenced by a male perspective.(I am in no way male-bashing, by the way...);Excellent resource. Enjoyed the reading immensely, and would love to read this collection! Would be interesting to compare/contrast with Grimm...;I think you're right on the money, Ann. I have been thinking about similar things (of course I start really getting my brain in gear AFTER I've written my little essay......). The idea that a woman's ""power"" - her ability to fix a problem (ie, brothers who are geese....) lies in her willingness to shut up, stick herself in a tree, and sew shirts of flowers... well, that is much different than going on a quest to find a golden apple.;I think that's a solid essay idea. These essays have a very small scope (holy cow they're short!), and this seems like a nice, confined-yet-interesting topic. Enjoy writing!;Interesting thread. Thanks.  So I'm in on the line of thought that the queen of hearts represents ""society"" at large - unpredictable, arbitrary rules that change on what seems to be a whim, crazy consequences always threatened but not really executed (excuse the pun...)...I especially like the comment of being ""too big for some things, too small for others."" I remember struggling like that as a kid, too.  ;I thought about that, too. I'm enjoying the video lectures a lot - and would have enjoyed the perspective. That said, I bet if we'd seen them before we would have read many essays that were variations on the videos' themes..... and, speaking for me, anyway, it could have made coming up with a thesis more difficult because I would have been afraid of ""copying"" the lecture....A tricky balance!;I just checked - they're still there!  ;So this was brought up in another thread, but it's interesting in its own right - so I wanted to give it its own thread....Identity. As I read through these two stories, I was struck at the concept of identity. Alice's identity is in flux through these stories. She forgets who she is (in the woods...), she is easily convinced that she doesn't exist (such a mean trick,Tweedledee and Tweedledum!)... She forgets the words to poems she knows and struggles to explain who she is....I'm interested in others' thoughts (as well as examples that I've failed to write here... bedtime!).....;I guess I hadn't thought about it much before; I'm not really an Alice aficionado. Thanks for the heads-up on that... I'll check out some materials!  ;In chapter 5 of Through the Looking Glass, Alice tells the Queen: ""I'm seven and a half, exactly."";I found them hard to score, too - even though I've graded hundreds of essays in the past. Only one of the five essays I read really ""wowed"" me, and I was very disappointed with general form. It was very hard to follow the logic of most of the essays, and I read them multiple times to give them the benefit of the doubt. I felt like a scrooge in scoring, but if it simply isn't understandable...... I'm curious to see what my scores are, now that I've seen others' essays.....I think people are struggling with the concept of a single, contained thesis. People are biting off too much topic and struggling to do anything with it....;I think you have a great point, Florencia - it's important to separate form from content. While that can be difficult to do when form interferes with meaning, it's worth working through....;"

Now - I enjoyed the novel (a lot, really...), so this isn't coming from a position of sour grapes.... but: it seems to me that Stoker takes every opportunity for Mina's intelligence and strength to be surprising, or unusual... and the male party members all seem to *need* to see her as something to be protected. They walk on eggshells around her!  Not sure where I'm going with this, except that I don't know that I could consider this to be a feminist novel at all.

Women have always worked, have always done the ""man"" things (whatever we want to say about that distinction....). And it is interesting that in the end Mina ceases these activities, even though in the course of the novel she many times states that she enjoys those intellectual and professional activities....  I, too, gave up with the ""sweet, sweet"" tally. It's there that I think Mina really gets short-shrifted. She may be vital to the story (We must clear the stain on her forehead, Rah!), but she is more an object than otherwise. She gets the occasional moment to shine, but ultimately she ends up just a piece of sleeping luggage to be toted around...;Anthony - your comment reminds me of a thought I had as I read (and then, of course, forgot...) - specifically about Caterpillar's mushroom.

Every once in a while I come across one that is improved by illustration, but generally I find them distracting. Either I skip them altogether (honestly - I overlook them) or they get in the way - pull me out of the story in my head. Unless I'm reading a graphic novel, I'd rather keep the pictures to a minimum.  I can appreciate the love many have for the illustrations in Alice, but me... well, they don't add much for me.  ;Oooh, nice Joshua. That little tidbit of a post made me think.

Then he tosses in the occasional news article to give you a sense of what's happening in the outside world - stuff the individual ""narrators"" may not know or realistically mention in their diaries.I love this format in Dracula; it makes the novel feel very real to me.;I've always been partial to the Reader Response method of criticism:  Reader-response criticism  is a school of  literary theory  that focuses on  the reader  (or ""audience"") and his or her experience of a  literary work, in contrast to other schools and theories that focus attention primarily on the author or the content and  form  of the work.Although literary theory has long paid some attention to the reader's role in creating the meaning and experience of a literary work, modern reader-response criticism began in the 1960s and '70s, particularly in America and Germany, in work by  Norman Holland,  Stanley Fish,  Wolfgang Iser,  Hans-Robert Jauss,  Roland Barthes, and others. Important predecessors were  I. A. Richards, who in 1929 analyzed a group of  Cambridge  undergraduates' misreadings;  Louise Rosenblatt, who, in  Literature as Exploration  (1938), argued that it is important for the teacher to avoid imposing any ""preconceived notions about the proper way to react to any work""; and  C. S. Lewis  in  An Experiment in Criticism(1961).Reader-response theory recognizes the reader as an active agent who imparts ""real existence"" to the work and completes its meaning through interpretation. Reader-response criticism argues that literature should be viewed as a performing art in which each reader creates his or her own, possibly unique, text-related performance. It stands in total opposition to the theories of  formalism  and the  New Criticism, in which the reader's role in re-creating literary works is ignored. New Criticism had emphasized that only that which is within a text is part of the meaning of a text. No appeal to the authority or  intention of the author, nor to the  psychology  of the reader, was allowed in the discussions of orthodox New Critics.from  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader-response_criticism;I enjoyed the book, a lot - but did anyone notice that not ten minutes after the group discussed that Dracula can take the form of a bat, Quincy took a shot at a bat that had been sitting on the windowsill? (Mina Harker's Journal, September 30, chapter 17) And no one made the connection?And how did no one notice that Mina then suddenly began having symptoms suspiciously akin to Lucy's?I admit I read with a 21st century perspective, but sheesh!

I think these novels still have much worth, though - they may not meet our modern sensibilities, but they are powerful in their own way.  I had read Dracula before, and recently read some Dickens and his contemporaries, so perhaps that made this read easier for me. I think it would be more difficult to really enjoy Dracula within the context of this class given the tight time frame. In college, when I first had to read Dickens, I absolutely hated him. Now, when I get to read at my leisure, I find  Dickens wonderfully rewarding... some novels are best savored rather than consumed.  So Dracula was an okay read for me, and I enjoyed it.

Did he contemplate the life he sparked, then abandoned? Memory may not serve me right, but I believe he wasn't overly concerned until consequences began knocking at his door.The being I have more sympathy for. Yes, he is vengeful, and willing to murder the innocent, but he, at least, has the lack of parenting to partially blame for it (Would I have grown differently if every contact I had with others was negative, dangerous, and hurtful?

Are they lessons that success does not necessarily go to the good, merely the more clever?

And for that matter among others, I think they will last. But what about adding new basis vectors? Have all of them been already done?Thanks;Hi Lucia,Yes, exactly, that's what I suspect I see too. They have changed form. And I'm afraid this change is more dramatic than the change we see in let's say horror genre, or mystery genre, or romance genre for that matter. I have read very old romance stories that pull on the very same strings that modern stories in the genre do. It doesn't seem to be the case in fairy tales.Thanks;Hi Kimaya,Very good point. Child care methods and philosophies have changed dramatically. Instilling fear and obedience are not among the things I want my stories to deliver to them. Inspiration, dreaming big and going for it are. And yet, I see great potential for our very own homemade fairy tales to deliver these values. So, could the genre stay  alive and be used still at bedtimes, new tales, new values for new societies, but the same bare and non-complex structure?  Here's a book I came upon (I have not read it) where a Freudian psychologist explores the use of fairy tales for children.http://www.amazon.com/Uses-Enchantment-Meaning-Importance-ebook/dp/B004FGMPHG/ref=la_B001IODKGS_1_1?...Very good point. Thanks.;Thanks for the information, Elle.  ;Hi Crystal,Have you tried the public library? They should have them, and if not, they can always bring them for you through inter-library loan (I'm not sure if you are in U.S. or not) but in any case, a public library or a university library near you should have them for free usage. Good luck!;That is a good question. There is this issue that the emotional impact of story on the reader is among the most important aspects of it as a book, and while reading, we only have our own emotions to watch and report. So from that aspect, I think it is valid. A deeper validation would be perhaps using the discussion forums to get a vote from other students on the type of emotion being delivered, making it a more scientific approach.  ;I think, yes, you may. I for one, find the personal experiences of readers very valuable insight. It's what I cannot access with just myself as reference. It would definitely enrich my reading, and I would definitely appreciate your sharing.Thanks;Aschenputtel (Cinderella) and some other fairy tales have middle eastern versions, different names, slightly different setting and plots, but essentially the same stories. Did they develop independently or did travel and trade spread them throughout the globe?If they developed independently, does that mean the human culture was more uniformly developed a long time ago? Is the culture more heterogeneous now than before?  ;Thanks everyone, for the insight into this.;I feel this intense effect after finishing the tales, an effect that I cannot quite put in words. I guess immersing that intensely in anything is bound to generate new brain networks, or change the existing ones. The feeling is of these tales having touched me on a deep subconscious level. But on the surface I cannot word the effect that I feel.  Naming emotions has always been my weakness.  Can you put it in words if they changed your brain, and how?;Hi Michelle, I agree. Also as a writer, I found it easier with these tales to watch for when and how the emotion is evoked in the reader. I think it may be because of the simplicity of the strings they pull at. But the simplicity does not prevent us from combining the effects into more complex cases. It just makes the analyzing of them easier. It was a great experience from that aspect.;Hi Greg,I find the simplicity of characters a useful learning tool, if one is into writing fiction. These one dimensional characters, in my view, make the building blocks, basis vectors if you will, of the space of human motivations. This way, they are easy to analyze and understand, and also easy to combine, to make more complex multidimensional beings.Thanks;Hi Katy,I found the experience of writing very different from what I had thought. While reading, I had noticed something that I wanted to share and decided it would be my essay, and that I would just write it and be done with it. But when I actually sat down to write, it made me review the entire reading in my mind and it brought some of the aspects I had learned on a subconscious level to a conscious knowing. The writing became an integral part of my learning, without it the impact would be much less. So, now, I am looking forward to the next essay and the door it will open to me.Marvelous experience.

I was going to ask that question. But, with your permission, I will ask that one in a separate thread. In connection with this thread, though, you said you did not care for Alice herself. Would you say it was the world-building that made you love the book, or was it something else?Thanks;I totally agree. Word-play was definitely lost in the translations that I had read. However, I fancy even more was lost. I somehow had never gotten the feel of the atmosphere Carroll is drawing here. But, then again, the entire world is built through that word-play. And, now that I think about it, even the hook for me was the word-play (Alice talking to herself.) How amazing! I think you pinpointed the answer to the other two threads that I had started. I think I got my answer for all of them: The word-play. Thanks.;Hi Megan,  Now that I have finished reading this unit, I wanted to add a small note.   I begin to really see what this course is about. It is helping me grasp what makes these masterpieces, masterpieces. And the beautiful answer this course is leading me to: that the answer is not entirely inside the text itself, but in the impact these works have had on human culture. It became crystal clear to me, once really grasping Alice, that one could not possibly remain the same after reading it, and that in fact, going back to history, one did not remain the same. Fiction   s contribution is a concept I   m seeing in a totally different light with the aid of this course.   Human mind, modern world, this course it every single bit, what its title promises.

As for kids and adults, I believe the dreamy world appeals to kids but the deeper message is for adults.  ;Hi William,Thank you so much, for the clarity of your response about the place where you were hooked. It's very helpful. And I agree about the 'who am I question, too.'Thanks.;Being originally from a part of the world where English was not the first language, I had come upon many translations of Alice in Wonderland. Later in here, I watched movies, and other renditions of it. And having never really encountered the original text, I deemed the book 'boring.' It is so NOT boring. I can't wait to return to Wonderland when I put it down.  So, is it untranslatable? And even in English language, what is it about the book that seems so totally lost in movies and other renditions?;I agree, Megan. I think that's the reason. I remember reading a translation of Voltaire's Candid and wondering why it was so famous, and where was the humor, until I read the French original and absolutely fell in love with it. Carroll is definitely in that category, as far as translations go.  Thanks;Thanks for the insight into Russian language, Olena.

You mention quite a few things that I had not thought about. Thanks again.  ;Hi Gustavo, yes, exactly. I do sometimes feel like I'm reading too much into the piece. But the reality, perhaps, is that a strong image can bear many meanings.

So wonderful.;This essay is on Rappaccini   s Daughter and the possible themes which can render different readings of the story. The image of a    poisonous human,    with its dimensions of science and humanity, is a powerful and timeless one, making various readings possible.Reading one--Battle against science: yet another tale of pursuit of science gone awry because of man   s disconnection from human concerns. Professor Baglioni   s final words, denouncing Rappaccini   s research, support this reading.   Reading two--Battle of sexes: Misery brought upon women by men. Beatrice   s father, her lover, and the professor, are all men. And although she had the poison weapon, as her father put it, so no one could do her wrong, everyone did. The final image of her falling to the ground at their feet resonates with this reading.Reading three--Battle of men over ownership of women: the human root of the father   s reluctance to part with her daughter, his plan of keeping her away from the world, and then fashioning a bridegroom for her support this reading.Reading four--Battle of generations: The older generation destroying the younger generation with their good wishes of living their lives for them. This appears not only in the relation between Rappaccini and her daughter, but also in the words of Baglioni to Giovanni, that he would not let the son of his friend fall prey to Rappaccini.Reading five--Battle of love against religious beliefs: Giovanni is torn between his love for Beatrice and the religious beliefs that tell him if her breath extinguishes life (monstrosity of physique,) then her soul too should be monstrous, the beliefs that lead him to contribute to her demise with his harsh words.More readings are possible. A clear and powerful image makes a story capable of bearing various themes. Further, such a story is able to evolve with time and support content relevant to new eras.peer 1      Great.

That way when the course comes around again I'll already have a solid insight and be even better prepared for it.;Hello,This is Nandini from Chennai, India.  are there any other Indian students to form a study group?;Bear in mind, Casey, that the Grimms did not 'write' the stories, as in, inventing them. These tales were around for a long time, as folktales, as warning tales, etc. The Grimms were simply the ones who wrote them down in a collection to be published and studied many years later. A.S. Byatt, in the introduction to my version points out that ""the Grimms' narrative style moves from the impersonal oral to the 'authored' story with psychology."" Meaning, they started just writing down the tales that were told to them, but at some point, they began to change little details of the story for better flow and other reasons. Like myths, there were also often many different versions of the tales, too.;As for the title of the post, I don't think it has. Science Fiction is every bit as awesome as it's ever been - but we progress in actual science so quickly that it's hit a sort of literary uncanny valley. In the 1950's, the projections of future technology had a lot more wiggle room than they do now, since we have the technology (and even better, often) nearly as soon as the story's been read.Also, in the 1950's-1960's and some of the 1970's, we had a very strong Space program, and inherently more reason to look forward. I feel like we need to be actually exploring new territory in order to do it in our fantasy. ;I certainly see what you mean about the uncanny valley.  I sketch a lot, and most of my drawings include mythical and fantasy characters and creatures. Consequently, I end up looking up and studying other people's work for the sake of self-improvement. I find that if I ever do too much of this research in one day (more than 20 concepts), my own imagination freezes up, rendering me unable to draw anything new, anything I hadn't already seen before.  There is an infinite number of ways a green dragon can be drawn, but few differences in those green dragons.  Perhaps, because sci-fi is now all around us, we (both creators and consumers of sci-fi) have hit the same sort of saturation point? It hasn't necessarily lost its awesome, but rather hit a point where all new ideas seem pretty much the same.  I hope I haven't gone off topic or misunderstood your point, Casey.  ;WOW! I love your post. It really got me thinking. Your right once you have been so saturated with a topic it is hard to come up with anything new. I'm a young adult science fiction writer and coming up with some completely new is very hard because so much has been done already. Sometime it feels like I'm just rewriting the something in different words. That's when I have to stop and make an adjustment to what I'm doing.; So the artform became science in a fiction setting instead of fictional science  Wow, that is an excellent observation! But I wonder where the line is drawn (or if it can be drawn) between these two? A little bit of science in fiction can help to suspend your disbelief and drawn you into the world a bit more, but fictional science can be more fun and escapist. I'd hate for a book to be a slave to either end of the spectrum, but I do like a little bit of science fact in my SF and, done right, I don't think it gets in the way of the fun and escapism. One technique I enjoy in SF books is taking the technology of today (or maybe a few years from now) and exploring the ramifications of it. For example, Halting State by Charles Stross looks at online roleplaying games a few years from now and how they are being used by criminals. The technology in that book feels like it could exist within the next five years and supports the plot without getting in the way. ;The awesome of this topic is filling me with nerd fire. I'm not entirely sure how to quote other posters on this forum so I'll try my best to not mangle too badly. Firstly, Casey you're right. Sci-fi has become a derivative of itself, but only because it's the natural evolution of a genre that has been around as long as it has. And the spawning of sub-genres is what iteratively brings us back to the Hard v. Soft Sci-fi as Pradyumn observed.  But I think what Gar said points to an even more astounding possibility, one I've thought of exploring for a while now. That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.  ;Theo, I'd wager you're better versed than I am in Sci-fi lore at this point, as I have yet to make the acquaintance of the good Doctor. I've just had a little more time to distil my thoughts on the matter. But I concur that using theoretical science as a means to explain fantastical elements is simply the next progression in the evolution of Sci-fi. Just taking the Grimm Bro's stories and thinking how the Dr. would explain talking animals, would bring in whole new elements of fantasy and Sci-fi as a duo instead of opposing forces.;I am with you Casey. I also disagree that in the more to learn section just tossed all comic books aside. All comic books are not super heroes. Even novels such as Ender's Game ( one of my favorite novels of all time) has been adapted into comic book form. Popular SF franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars have ongoing comics.... And I would definitely would argue comics such as Swamp Thing, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (that's right, they were comic books before they were movies) may beg to differ, but that's just me and my opinion. ;My belief about science fiction is that we have evolved from stories about the glorious, technologically advanced future, to what happens when all that goes wrong. My new favorite books and stories are dystopian novels, such as Brave New World, and that have had new young life breathed into them, thanks to the success of series like The Hunger Games. There is a plethora of dystopian series out there now, such as my favorite, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and others, such as Delirium by Lauren Oliver, Partials by Dan Wells,   The Maze Runner by James Dashner, and Across the Universe by Beth Revis (which is more of a pure sci-fi leaning than the others). I don't think sci-fi has ""lost its awesome""; I just think it has evolved and changed over time.  ;Possimpable! Love it! lolBut are dreams not fantasy's in themselves ...;SF as a whole is some sort of fantasy on its own, but I meant dreams more as a metaphor for ""humanity wishing for this or that"", not precisely dreaming while sleeping. Gibson ""dreamt"" of the cyberspace and built it up in his Sprawl Trilogy as well as his distopian corporate-controlled society where slums are the places where more ""freedom"" is possible.Humanity ""dreamt"" of traveling to the Moon as well as through time. Those dreams have fueled SF and as Casey stated: we need more problems to be fixed and IMHO the fast-progress technology and science that exist nowadays should create some kind of a new ""era"" or at least ""trends"" in the SF genre.What are your thoughts?;Maybe I am a little bit off topic with this but anyway... Have you read Argentinian or Latinoamerican sf? Because there you'll find a lot of awesomeness that it's missing in Anglo sf. Of course, there's not much techno-awesomeness in it but there a lot of focus in what could be called social, anthropological or metaphysical science fiction, plus a lot of humor and ""uncorrectness"" (in form and in language).If you are interested (and can read in Spanish, of course), I recommend you to go to Axxon, the greatest and oldest sf magazine of Argentina (24 years old and it was always digital, it was first distributed in floppy disks and then online). The url is axxon.com.ar.Also check Cuasar  (also long lived, 25 years old), Pr _xima and La Idea Fija (which is not strictly a sf magazine but it is sf friendly);I am Mexican and have been struggling to find latinamerican SF. Thanks SO much for the recommendations, Gabriel. I'll check them out.;""Sci-Fi is there to come up with the ideas, not the actual working technologies.""Yes, thank you.As for the point about Penn Jillette. Interesting. One can marvel at explained things as well as unexplained ones... if its done well enough. So, in order for an explained and detailed Sci-fi to generate 'awesome', it needs to be written/presented even better than otherwise?;Thank you, Casey. Point well made, and taken.And Cheri just simplified what I was trying to say. Thanks.Going back to Casey's point, the part ""if done well enough"" is what's bugging me. Let's leave aside how deeply Sci-fi goes into scientific explanations.

Star Trek gives the science and renders a mystery ascertainable while The Lion, the  Witch...  retains the mystery, offering no explanation, relying on our acceptance of the created world working according to its own rules. In Fantasy we accept the rules of the new world and maybe just judge based on how consistent the rules  are in their application. In Sci Fi there is an expectation that the explanation has some anchor in reality, some point of  connection to the  world we know. There is a plausible line of extrapolation from the real to the  scientific fiction.  A sense of awe is evoked when a particular reader is gobsmacked and enthralled by the story presented, where his mind finds the spark of childhood wonderings. An unexposed person, like any unknowing child, may be awed by newness, the strange or the unexpectedly unique in any of the elements of Literature: plot, character, setting, conflict, dialogue, style, diction or narrative technique once the new element finds some resonance. The source of awe can be from any of the elements of a novel, play or poem.Has Sci-Fi lost its awesomeness? It depends on the exposure of the person reading it. Someone new to Sci Fi may still be impressed, but for someone steeped in the genre, it will take a paradigmatic shift or, as per the Penn Jilllette comment, a masterful presentation to create the sense of spectacle.Unless technology gives us something new to consider, or, some innovative writer finds a unique idea linked to our current reality but so strange it sets the mind a wagging, then, for the seasoned Sci/Fi consumer, Sci/Fi would have lost its awesomeness.Loss of awesomeness? Depends on who is reading and their exposure and the who is writing and their content.  Because of the monochromatic nature of Sci/Fi content  arising from  the monopoly of ideas created by Hollywood and the resultant variations on the     themes, to the exposed consumer, there may be less awesomeness. Maybe the surfeited reader of Sci/Fi needs to take a break and fast a little from the genre. Give it some time to become unfamiliar. Then, maybe it would still offer some awesome in its current forms.;While there is nothing excluding them from falling with in fantasy or scifi, in of themselves I would say they belong to the larger Speculative Fiction category rather than belonging specifically as Fantasy or SciFi.;Interesting! I always felt like Omelas was a classic dystopia, because of the horrible reason that it is so great there. I still tear up when I read the line that is something like - 'it's because of the child that they are so gentle with children'.

You can do video chat, but I've found that to be too much hassle.I definitely would be interested in a study group, feel free to email me geralyn.lance@gmail.com :);When I reflect on fairy tales and how they have affected (and continue to affect) me, I can't help but contemplate the unique rhythms of organization and occurrence which are common within fairy tales (a rhythm that is rather at odds with that of the real world or the methods used to develop plot in what we might typically think of as ""literature""). The idea of straw or coal choosing independently to make a bridge of itself and then dying is outside the bounds of a more literal application of reality to writing as is a myriad of other happenings within the realm of the fairy tale. What I have learned from fairy tales then is that ALL things can be made to do ANYTHING when imagination has been applied sufficiently. I think that's a bit closer to how I saw the world as a child, how many of us may have seen the world in youth. Through fairy tales, an adult can reorient their mind to a time when they hadn't compartmentalized the universe into ""this does this"" and ""that does that"". It's like being able to access a new brain, but it's really just an older, dynamic one that somewhere along the line got put to the side. Anyway... yeah... lol.  ;Hi Vignesh! Thanks for including your essay for review (it's good people are doing this; I think it will help to get us into the proper mindset for when we submit on time in the future). I'll try to approximate the normal grading structure, similar to Samantha above --  Form 2 - The writing is acceptable, flowing from one topic to the next in what feels to be a sensible fashion. That having been said, there are certain levels of evidence lacking to lend your assertions strength which, had they been present, would have given a better control of the flow. Keep an eye on your capitalization when you are converting nouns into proper nouns (ie. Coal of anger should be Coal of Anger as it exemplifies the concept).Content 2 - While I don't think I completely agree with the symbols you interpret from the text, I do think that what you've presented here is enough to make me interested in learning ""why"" you interpret the images as you have. Hooking me with your content is almost as important as making me believe it, so congrats. I also think that ascribing those interpretations raises worthwhile questions for us as an audience.Overall, I would like to have seen more from the essay. Your premise is good, but lacks the support necessary to sway your audience as effectively as one would hope. As a suggestion, one trick for making the essay a little longer and helping to lend strength to your argument would be to highlight text that shows why you are labeling an element from the story as particularly symbolic. I think you did well and I hope to see more of your work in the future!;Hi Andres! Thanks for sharing your essay with us :) I won't belabor the point of getting an additional set of eyes to look over your drafts as everyone has mentioned that already. As far as subject goes, I think you're observations concerning vice and virtue are correct. It seems like many of the fables we enjoy (and see represented in this book) have something to teach us concerning conduct that is rewarded or punished. My only real critique on your chosen theme is that, while your audience is likely to agree with and appreciate your findings, it's not a point that we have to stretch ourselves to understand. Feel free to expound an idea that is a bit off the wall (as long as you can support it). We are scifi and fantasy fans, after all -- we like unconventional :P I think you did great on the first essay and I hope we get a chance to see more from you. Cheers!;Hi Martha :) You were kind enough to comment on a number of other people's essays (including my own), so I'll try to return the favor. Hopefully, not ineptly, lol.I like your writing here, I think you do a great job of separating your points and tying them back to the original thesis. One way that you could strengthen the essay is to add more transitioning material at the closing of paragraphs so that you move between points with increased ease. As far as content goes, you pull from a lot of sources, laying a good foundation for your points. I think some of your prongs could actually stand alone well as their own essays and would have enjoyed seeing the ""We see in... unequal relationship"" paragraph restructured and expanded upon to be its own essay. Nice topic, writing, and content :)  Thanks for sharing your essay with us! It was enjoyable to read and I hope to see more of your writing!;Well... this is disheartening... I had remembered my due dates incorrectly. At least I am in good company and it is okay to miss an assignment! I suppose I can go ahead and post what I'd intended to submit tomorrow night (as I had thought incorrectly Thursday was the due date for our initial responses). Though it's not eloquent, I hope you find it useful for something (even if it's just hysterics):In    The Death of the Hen   , many objects and animals are engendered with anthropomorphic qualities by the authors. Given the recurrent use of the writing tool, it is of interest to the reader that within the text exists two separate brooks, one which is ascribed the qualities of human desire   (coveting silk in exchange for water) and the other which is never noted to have human characteristic at all. As the reader compares the culpability of the first brook in the death of the hen versus the second brook in the death of all the other woodland animals (and, arguably, a piece of straw and gleed of coal), one realizes that the tale is built in a manner which creates a space in which the audience itself may reflect on their own values regarding accountability.  The text confronts its reader with a question:  Which is more at fault for death and destruction     the force which chooses or that which acts without choice?  Inanimate objects provide causes for death such as the nut which chokes the hen and the brook which drowns the mourners. However, it is the choice of the hen which causes her to eat a nut too large for herself, the choices of the brook and the bride which forces the cock to take too long in getting back to her with water, and the choice to follow the cock in a funeral procession which leads the grieving animals to follow the deceased hen to her fate.  Ultimately, the story appears to identify    the force which chooses    as being the primary party responsible for death and destruction as at the end the cock himself laments so sorely that he himself dies at the mound, but one is left to wonder if the authors have also proven that the emotions which compelled all of the choices leading to so many tragedies is itself an act which occurs without choice. And, if so, is life itself at once a collision of choice and action where the two forces are themselves inextricable from one another?;Thanks, Martha, for your critique! To be honest, I think I'd have to weigh against using a question at the end of an essay (even though I did it here). Had I gone back through to revise it, I believe I'd have blended the question with the last sentence or simply jettisoned it altogether. Since I was already late though and was on the verge of being late for the midnight deadline in this very thread, I decided that the essay would stand as is. I appreciate you giving it a look and even more so your willingness to offer your thoughts :) Once again, thank you for your time and effort!;"

With the Fall, that one tiny act of disobedience brought death into the world, condemning ALL people.  Course, that's just how I saw it.;I think it can be wholly difficult but then again, I exceptionally worry about it in my writing. Does writing something hideous make you that? In Will Self's The Book of Dave, the titular character is basically the quick guide to casual misogyny, homophobia and racism. Does that necessarily display any quality that the writer has? I don't think so.  Whilst there are some writers that it is DEFINITELY a reflection on, can this be fully extrapolated? I mean, theoretically I can write a story about say...a man who hates women. Indeed, I did write a...very disturbing story of a male porter sexually assaulting a catatonic woman in a psychiatric ward. Is the very fact that I wrote it and he didn't get away with it mean that I think it was a perfectly acceptable behaviour or does it mean something else.There are a lot of shades of grey to consider with this sort of thing but I know I've read quite a number of books that i have had to stop reading and return to after kicking a door or calming down.;Apparently we don't need to do ALL the essays in order to pass but I wonder if this will mean that there may be a bit of a change to how clear it is when and where these will be submitted for the rest of the classes...I'm in the same boat. Cocked up the time so I'm gonna take my time since it doesn't matter anymore.There is a thread to give each other feedback though if you missed the deadline but I'm just incredibly vexed at the moment and can't think properly.;That's what I thought. Whilst there is 'regret' with growing up, it seems it's far more tied to mortality than anything else...;I wish it was made clearer when the deadlines were...I miscalculated by an hour and this is wholly frustrating and I'm just incredibly self-hating right now. I will post the essay promptly but I need to compose myself first.;Ahh...right.  It's still isn't incredibly clear but I guess I will know for next time...;I felt that it was an incredibly interesting interpretation for that story. Whilst as a psychologist, I am a bit iffy about using the word 'psyche' as it's a bit wishy-washy, I think there is a good basis here. However, I felt like some of the conclusions felt   a bit unsupported.  It does seem to be a story about grief and bereavement but you could afford a little more explanation since you're just over the lower word count.  Structurally speaking, you have a clear intro, middle and conclusion. I didn't like the ""there once was a pair of brothers"" thing at first but it's grown on me as I've written this! But the middle seems a bit muddled.    If you changed the order - you should have the description of the hen, the cock,the brook and the like before the other animals crossing the brook. It would make it flow better.I'd personally separate the three with a new paragraph them out for clarity.Overall, I think it's a pretty good essay but I hope I've made it clear where to improve. It's been pretty informative but you could explain a touch more and make it flow a bit better. However, that said, it's not a bad attempt and it would take incredibly little editing to make it brilliant.;This is my essay...In the Grimm   s Fairy tales, there is a continuing emphasis on cloth. It is my hypothesis that it   s a running metaphor. In Greek mythology, thread was the symbol of life used by The Three Fates (Perhaps the source of The Three Spinsters). Thus, fate and thread are entwined.   In Snow White, the Queen cuts herself embroidering and wishes for pregnancy and it is fulfilled. In Mother Hulda, the spindle falls and the girl must retrieve it and this is clearly a near-death experience parable     the good are rewarded and the bad are punished. In the Sleeping Beauty, even when the spindles were burnt, Fate could not be stopped. Clothing is used to either attempt to change Fate (e.g. The Six Swans) or to ensure it (e.g. The Goose Girl). In all of these, clothing is used as a way to hide the true nature of a person but it always fails. The only story that does not follow this is The Rabbit Bride as clothing successfully changed Fate. However, considering the    unnatural    arrangement of the wedding, exemplified by the crow and fox, Fate could be changed.   Generally, only three types of people change Fate: tailors, spinsters and Rumplestiltskin. In    The Gallant Tailor   , he caused his own fate through embroidery. In The Table, the Ass and the Stick, the magic gifts are related to parts of life but without the cloth accompanying them, these are meaningless. In the Straw, the Coal and the Bean, they all fail to escape their Fate until a tailor saved the bean. In Rumplestiltskin, alchemic and unnatural spinning and changing of Fate had a price       life itself.   Fate cannot be altered unless they are a master of the art     and in this context of Fate, this would be in terms of gods and demons and thus attempts to change it by mortals are doomed to fail.;I think you've got something here. There is definitely a dichotomy between vice and virtue within the tales. But if I am being honest, there are some spelling and punctuation errors. Your grammar is generally okay (a few minor errors) but there is need for improvement. For the next assignment, I would get someone to beta or proof-read your response so that those errors do not impede your overall mark. I could highlight the errors that you had but I wouldn't wish to impose on you or anything considering I think you're doing a pretty damn good job in writing an essay in a non-native language! However, if you wish me to, I'd be happy to oblige.  You do bring up a good point though and I think your essay has promise. I do think you would need to delve a little deeper though. It might be an obvious conclusion to arrive to so I think you could go into more social/religious/political sides of it. Why would people tell children these tales especially when some of these had far more adult beginnings in the oral tradition. Of course that might be too general for the essay in question so it definitely is tricky!One thing though, the conclusion doesn't seem to follow from the rest of the story. It feels like there is two different ideas - of vice and virtue in the stories and the alterations between oral and written traditions and the transitional nature of the stories over time. It was a nice conclusion, don't get me wrong, but didn't reflect on the rest of the essay. jsut something for next time.You have good ideas but you need to ensure that you keep to one idea. I'm not taking spelling and punctuation in this instance to be a huge detriment but I would get someone to have a look over it before you hand things in.;This essay is pretty well done! It has a clear idea, is well argued and relatively well structured. Femininity and beauty are such discussed aspects of the Grimm's Tales that it's one of the most common things spoke about it. As such, to ensure that the essay covers all the available points, there are many factors and levels that are going on. I think you have covered most of them but since you concentrated on feminine beauty, there was little discussion of female characters who did not fit into this. You did discuss beautiful person/horrid personality but there was nothing really about outside that... However, I fully understand that space is a huge factor (honestly, beauty in the Grimm's Tales could easy hit a few thousand words without any of it being irrelevant) and thus it's not a huge criticism but it's wise to acknowledge it further as it could be used as counter examples.  As for the structure, it's very well done aside from the conclusion. I feel it's a bit lacking but I could be biased since I've been told for years that my conclusions have been pitifully short. What is the thing you need to go over is word count. You only went over by two little words but I'd just keep an eye on it since it could become a problem with a more stringent marker?Overall, I think this was a tip-tip essay but you need to watch out for counter-examples and to make sure that you're within the word limit. They're not big issues at all though.;Aha, I wasn't aware of this! What a neat system! Usually these systems would accept anything and thus the word count thing was up to the marker...although in my last classes, they would stop reading after the permitted word count so...;Good essay attempt! It's an interesting look at the power dynamics - that social movement is only really permitted when the upper hand is perceived as being unfair or bad. It's the David and Goliath effect, essentially.However, there was a few characters like the fisherman and his wife or the sausage, the mouse and the bird who weren't particularly bad people. The Fisherman thing is more reminiscent of Macbeth - too ambitious - and the sausage/mouse/bird thing is more about those easily led. Of course those are my own interpretation but they do go along similar lines as such, I'm unsure about how these would fit into your essay.Structurally, this is very good but...there really isn't any firm conclusion which is a damn shame. The final paragraph is beautifully written, don't get me wrong, but it's not a conclusion, it's still part of your main body of the essay. Considering that you're over the limit, I would look into pruning words were possible to retain a low word count and giving yourself a full essay.  Overall, it's a very good essay but without that conclusion, it lets it down and you're clearly capable of completing it since the rest of the essay is to a high standard.;It's a good attempt as you have taken a slightly more technical approach i.e. concentrating on realism. You're right in that even ignoring the more fantastical elements such as witchcraft and giants, there are some things that are highly exaggerated. But, there is a problem in that you don't especially give us examples of exaggeration. The man sleeping during the race isn't exaggerated, it's just downright idiotic (although the race itself is pretty damn exaggerated). Anthropomorphism again isn't really exaggerating, it's giving a power to an animal, like I wouldn't call giving a human character X-Ray vision is exaggeration, just fantasising, which may be kissing cousins with exaggeration but but innately so. Additionally, I'm a little uncertain as to why you called the tales 'antagonistic'. They're certainly a bit schizophrenic concerning child and adultness (which when you consider the overtly sexual and violent nature of the very original oral traditions of the tales, it doesn't really surprise me.) It is possible that I have misunderstood you.As for structure, it was a little hard to keep up with all the issues. Perhaps because this was under the word limit (by a significant bit), you could expand on your major points a touch to make it flow a little bit better? There's a bit of an conclusion but it would need to be extended to make it really work for you considering how good your introduction was in comparison.  Overall, it's not a bad essay. It brought up some points that I didn't especially think about when reading which is pretty good but essentially you need to flesh it out a touch more to make it flow better and to give it a solid conclusion.;I think you have a rather good interpretation of the story. There are issues with the divide between what the reader knows of the tailor and what everyone else does. The tailor does seem to be cunning and sometimes only survives out of sheer dumb luck (which is how he started this whole mess in the first place!). However, I do think that you can expand quite a bit on it. After all, is there not a juxtaposition between the pride he initially felt for killing the seven flies that is quickly put aside? There could be debate between the trickery that the tailor uses and the trickery other people use against him. Is either morally better and is this implied by this divide? Does he not think of himself as a cheat simply because his trickery is justified where others are not?The structure is there, there is a clear intro, main body and conclusion. But, like I have said before, we need more of it. As it stands, you're nearly a hundred words short of the lower word count which isn't good especially when you know yoru stuff and the rest of the essay is quite capable.  In conclusion, I'd say go a little deeper and go with it! You've got a good idea but you need to expand on it.;No problemo!And yeah. You probably were also being mindful of how short the essay was meant to be too so don't worry about it. :);We are all aware. It still does not detract from the issue that clarity is lacking in the website structure which caused this in the first place.   ;Psychoanalysis is nonsensical in terms of proper psychology but...this isn't strictly psychology. This isn't a science. In fact, I tell a lie.Are you familiar with qualitative analysis techniques? You know, constructionism, phenomenology and all that jazz? It is about the interpretation of speech and text. It cuts a fine line between speculation and interpretation and is knowingly subjective. Why those are used are made clear in their epistemologies, that gaining insights into those subjective worlds tells us a lot about groups and cultures that may surround certain aspects like into LGBT people or into disability...something that couldn't really be found in qualitative methodologies and can give novel insights into behaviours. These are subjective and interpretations are relative and thus not really falsifiable. it implies that there is no real truth to the world which is a perfectly valid philosophical stance to take.  How does apply to this? Well, it's literature. It will have as many interpretations as people who have read it. Many themes and interpretations may coincide and some may not. Quite frankly, the interpretation of literature is not a science and thus the restrictions of the scientific method a la Popper and Kuhn really do not apply. Psychoanalytic interpretations are interesting but in this academic field, the only evidence you need from this is...really from the text. Other sources such as time, criticism and all that good stuff are useful but...think about it this way. The text is your statistics. It's up to you how to interpret them (and you'll know that interpretation of those sweet, sweet numbers is almost as varied and subjective as interpreting literature).Ultimately, you don't need to agree with him in the slightest! I quite often didn't agree with my English lecturers   and so long as you can back it up from the text then they can't say a thing, dude.;...Because referencing something outside your own demographics has never been done? IDK, I fail to see how someone's religion means anything in terms of references. I can reference Christian, Hindu or whatever religious motifs you fancy, even though I am an atheist.  I think you need to get used to the idea that interpretation can go deeper than what the writers actually...err...wrote. Meaning is subjective, to speculate is to apply meaning with no text to back it up. Interpretation is to apply meaning with something to back it up.  This might seem radical but it's not about 'this is right' and 'this is wrong'. It's about arguing your case.  For a daft example. you could argue that Mother Hulda is a male fantasy about females 'beating' their 'bed' until 'white feathers' came out and they would be rewarded with gold, thus making it about prostitution and that lazy prostitutes get nothing and ones who get busy get their money. Of course it's not what I got out of it! However, it's not that difficult to apply any given meaning to any given thing so long as there is something in the text to back it up...Does this mean I am correct and my interpretation is the only one? No. Does this mean it's a good interpretation? No. It's more about how you do it over if it's right or not.;  I'm rather perplexed as to your concerns. This is not science and nobody is trying to make it like that. There's no truth where this is concerned as it is a exercise in determining what you got from a piece and why you came to such conclusions with evidence from the text and other sources. It is a world of grey, a world of could be and may be.I don't see why text will ultimately serve as a mirror of the writer's persona. There are a lot more factors to say why someone would write something than merely just their 'persona', just like personological factors like personality and intelligence will only have so much effect on a person's behaviour.  I can understand that as a psychologist, you're far more drawn to the author and analysing them than the text they have written. However, it is an impossible task (at least without a time machine). Looking into the literature can only give so much about the person. The story however is important to analyse as these stories influence other people and in reading them, they influence us. How they influence us is not in a 'magic bullet' model - there is no one interpretation that is fired into your head and you swallow it (regardless of what some theorists would speculate -cough- General Aggression Model -cough-). These different interpretations may hint towards the life and psychological make-up of the person or may just try to teach us something - try to teach us to be brave in the face of adversity or to not be a thief or that true love is possible. Additionally, they may just tell us much about that period of time, that society and the social conventions (and depending on how these are spoken about by the author, if they agree with them or not).  For example, look at the Harry Potter series. Trying to interpret a huge amount about JK Rowling's psychological welfare from those books is not a good idea (there is a link between dementors and depression but that's been specified by the author). What can be then interpreted? That cleverness and logic are very important? That bravery is good? That interpreting the world as good and bad is far too simplistic?With Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, there is something called double hermeneutics that plays a big role. It's building meaning on someone else's meaning - which is rather similar to the analysis of literature except it's a lot less structured and more vague. Although I get the feeling I have misinterpreted what you mean...I'm sorry that you find this problematic but you do know that you don't need to agree with the professor? You don't need to agree with any of his interpretations or his theories. He isn't intrinsically correct because he runs the class. So long as you can back up your interpretation with words from the text then you can interpret anything you like and fight back against interpretations that you think are codswallop so long as you can back it up with the text or with another source that disproves it (i.e. historical evidence and the like).;Don't worry, you're not exactly alone...There is a thread you can post your essay on to get feedback from others who didn't manage it. However, there is no grade I think. It's possible to miss a few of the essays and to be okay. I'm really unsure though. Stay in the class though.;If you look, there is a thread that those who didn't get it in on time for whatever reason but still wrote the essay can exchange feedback. It won't count towards our marks obviously but it can at least get a bit of feedback.;I know I'd still be interested in what you came up with! You should post it regardless and get a wee bit of feedback.;Actually, those theories are relatively old too...One of the only 'modern psychology theories' that could really apply (and that I recall) is the General Aggression Model (Anderson and Bushman, 2001). It implies that to witness violence is to replicate it - meaning that it was due to their general maltreatment that they eventually murdered the witch. Of course, it also implies that reading such tales fosters violent fantasies in people which is why they only 'deal out' the aggression needed.  Naturally, this is a highly limited theory (and one I despise with every fire of my being since it's riddled with error and misconception which is used on face value by the media and governments to demonise video game users). Any form of psychological theory will be very limited since we don't have any idea about biology or much about the environment, thus drawing any conclusion is going to be limited. I certainly disagree with the idea of Freudian analysis but then again, I'm relatively used to multiple theories being used in interpreting literature so it doesn't especially bother me. I'm used to the idea of my interpretations can be radically different from lecturers and it's fine.  I would fundamentally disagree with Piaget's childhood development being applicable in Hansel and Gretel. In Alice in Wonderland, yes...but Hansel and Gretel...not really.;This lovely little quote from the gryphon (Chapter Nine, AIW) kinda struck me on the head. There's a lot of mentions of growing up and the changes and the nonsense of adulthood that is discussed but this - to me - hit something poignant.Perhaps I am looking too deeply into this but perhaps it's a statement of personality, of the mind? Social roles dictate to us how to act in certain situations - you wouldn't act the same around your friends the way you would in, say, a job interview.  I'm unsure and this is just a gut response from reading the book however, do you think there is something to it? It's most likely tied into the adult world but I will need to finish reading to draw conclusions.

It allows you to develop critical skills and to see how other people approached the same problem.It's can only improve.*((*Subject to terms and conditions.));There is something so utterly delightful about that and I can't especially explain why but it does sound like the sort of thing that would be said during a tense scene with very intense, dramatic music.;What I know about the Alice illustrations from a documentary I watched years ago is that the illustrator was renowned for his satirical cartoons (which is why they can be rather peculiar and strange looking). I mean, if you look closely at the unicorn and the lion in Through the Looking Glass...it's Disraeli and Gladstone! Having them depicted as the Lion and Unicorn (both big ol' symbols of Britain and it's politics) and fighting, it's a political satire on the sly since these two are fighting, nobody around especially knows why and just wants them to stop.

I think that the first two had a pretty big influence on me. Roald Dahl knew that children like the grotesque and the icky. Whilst I am unsure about the anti-Semitism that some of his stories were meant to hold, some of his books held really important messages like...just because someone is your family, it doesn't mean they are correct or even good for you (Matilda). Or that cleverness and ingenuity can win out against poverty(Danny, Champion of the World. That grown ups can be scary but some of them are mad (Willy Wonka) or kind and gentle regardless of what they looked like (The BFG).I think the thing that I got from the Worst Witch was that even if you're a clumsy, scatterbrained and not good at school, you can still be a hero at the end of the day. That and magic schools are awesome.  ;I'm not offended by it. I think I have only been 'offended' once in my life by the violence in a story. That was 'The Penal Colony' by Franz Kafka which nearly made be vomit so I had to stop reading.  There are many reasons why I may not be offended and you may be. Perhaps it's because we could have differing levels of separation between the motion and the act (falls the shadow). Unless I have a deep connection to the characters and I don't know how the book ends, then violence doesn't especially effect or move me.  In the Grimm's Tales, I never connected with any of the stories. I could see parallels and symbolism and hidden meaning but on an emotional level, nothing. There wasn't a character I could have any emotional connection. With Alice, the worry about getting beheaded could be an issue but then again, I've seen the films since I was little. She was always dreaming and thus in no real danger. It does mean it's pretty damn annoying since you've kind of spoiled yourself! There's no peril or anything like that.But for some violence in books (or media in general), it can be played so...unrealistically that I can't feel anything from it. It's why I find horror films so ridiculously funny because it's about as realistic as David Cameron being the avatar of Lord Vivec. That being said, there has been times where it was turned my stomach and made me feel uncomfortable...Fair enough, if an animal is involved then I'm liable to crying. Christ, I cried when they exploded K-9 in Doctor Who.So, what is the point?From what I know of the next couple of assignments, these are not going to be fun topics for you. However, the only advice I can give you is to remind yourself that firstly, it is not real. Nobody real got harmed. Secondly, try to remain objective as you can. Pretend it's a really dull scientific paper that you're trying to understand.  Violence is an unfortunate aspect of the human race...it's something we can never stop. However, if you try and reassess the situation, there is some neurological evidence to suggest that if you reassess the text itself (i.e. look at it as a boring piece of academia than something really upsetting), it will stress you out far less than if you just try to suppress the disgust/anxiety associated with it.;No problemo!Reappraisal does take a bit of effort at the beginning but will make it a better overall experience for you in the end.

There may be other examples but tell me what you think.Carrol was relatively clear that he thought growing up sucked. However, the adult world that Alice was propelled into in the second book had a bit more of a feminine air, specifically for the ageing and 'stages' of life in females.With the flowers, there was something that definitely whiffed of a satire of social butterflies - of beautiful women at parties who seemed to only care about slagging off everyone else. I had always thought that the flowers were very snotty but it's only with this reading that it's very much in the realm of cattiness than anything else. One of them goes on about 'fading' and how hard it was to control yourself and it was just...very parallel to 'letting yourself go' and the vaguely hidden slander that could be being said.For the sheep, it just reminded me of grandmothers. Knitting and the white curly hair. I think Sylvia Plath referred to old grannies like that, could have been someone else. Additionally, the white queen seemed...kind of reminiscent of a dementia patient but I couldn't be certain.But don't you think so?

Whilst I am looking for critique (with counter examples since it is something that was suggested in feedback), essentially saying that these examples are just me applying my own life to the story is a bit over-dramatic and rather assuming considering that one of the biggest interpretations (from reading on this forum) is that it is about the tiresome process of growing up. I simply decided to concentrate on examples that seemed to correlate to big stages in female -specific development (and the exaggerations thereupon.)You're perfectly free to pick holes in theory but you seem to only be concerned with ""spoiling the charm"" of the story...which is pretty damn counter-productive to critical analysis of literature since it is intentionally going deeper than simple enjoyment and pleasure from reading the books.  ;Thanks for the heads up, man.

But hmm, free will versus determinism. It's a tough one to answer...even outside of the confines of Alice. I suppose, overall, it is determined. Since she already knew the prophecy, she willed it to be fulfilled. Whether her willing it caused it or it was just coincidental is a bit hard to say. When we are dreaming, how much can be actually motivated? I think the answer lies in lucid dreaming.

Sometimes you sentences got rather long (e.g. the opening sentence) which made it hard to follow at times. Regardless of that, I think you did rather well! You had good examples and the theme was interesting. :3I'll post everything I got under this:Superficially speaking, the Alice stories could be descibed as nonsensical. However, there is still underlying causal models.  These examples of alternative causality reflect on changes in 'natural order' into  a scientific world.  At the time, such changes were rampant and may have seemed random. The differing models in this story help to reflect this and mock it.  Firstly, look at Queen of Hearts and the White Queen. These reversals of causality (""sentencing first, then verdict"") have implications - from seeming silly to a miscarriage of justice. These examples are made explict. There are two examples of alternate models of causality that are also suggested. These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant.Chaos Theory implies that inital conditions causes differences in outcome, even if the cause is identical. An obvious example is Alice falling asleep. Each time, the conditions of where she falls asleep has an effect on how she experiences Wonderland. Should these conditions have changed in the slightest, then the experiece would also be greatly changed. It draws attention to the fact that even the smallest, unnoticeable factors may influence greater things.The other example is quantum indeterminacy and Schrodinger's Cat. Essentially, if you place a cat in a ealed box in which it may or may not die, it is in a state of flux. The cat is alive  and  dead. Only probability can determine the fate. Ironically, the life of the Chesire Cat is as probabilistic. The King and the executioner both argue about whether it is possible for the Chesire Cat to be executed i.e. whether the cat can die or not.It would only when they attempt to kill him that it would be known. From this, we can interpret that some things follow the laws of probabilty and not laws of causality.Conclusively, whilst Wonderland may seem random, there is still 'order'. It is a  story that attracts us to changes and dismisses them as nonsense as even having a few examples of non-typical causality implies that these changes are as mad as a hatter.Form:peer 1      The structure of the essay is perfect. You have proper beginning, main part and conclusion. However, I don't quite understand the meaning of this phrase: ""These models were after his time so such similarities are coincidental but still significant.""peer 2      You have a very nice style here, with a couple of suggestions for further improvement. You use a lot of ""ly"" words, and these can be overdone so try to use variety. In sentence 2, you have a sv error....there are stilll models. Same with in para 3 with conditions have. And try not to talk directly to your reader (for example with ""look"" or ""you."") Overall, though, this is pretty well constructed.peer 3      I found your vocabulary very difficult to read because of the amount of terminology you used. (which was, however, highly skilled) At times, your essay was even difficult to understand because of this. Besides, I found a few misspellings which I found rather disturbing.peer 4      The essay has cohesion and coherence because it clearly deals with a topic and sticks to it until the end. I feel however that the explanations are a little messy and that organising your sentences might help you. You could use more connectors to make transitions between ideas smoother. The only typo I found was the a missing ""s"" in sealed.peer 5      Good solid structure support this well laid out essay. The opening paragraph opens the idea of the story not necessarily being nonsensical. There were a few spelling issues but I would hazard a guess that these were simple typos. I felt that they didn't detract from the reading of the essay in any way.Content:peer 1      You have the most interesting topic I've read by far, and you prove it with perfect examples. Also I quite like you mentioning the quantum indeterminacy and Schrodinger's Catpeer 2      I like the content; it's interesting and does get me thinking. I like the emphasis on chaos theory esp with your caveat (though he was a mathematician so it's possible). In places, I think you might support your generalities with a specific. I know that's tough because of the word limitations, but if you do so the essay will be clearer.peer 3      Wow, this is really a profound analysis of the story! I would be interested in your other sources (apart from the book itself). I must say that I was surprised at how you analyzed even the smallest details and always found some interesting patterns.peer 4      The content is certainly very interesting and well argued. However, I have the feeling it was too big a topic for such a short essay.peer 5      I loved the content of this essay. The possible connections to Chaos Theory is something that never even crossed my mind so I found this essay to be very thought provoking. The concept that whilst it appears nonsensical but that there may well have been order underlying it actually makes a lot of sense when one thinks about the love Lewis Carroll had for logic puzzles.Other Remarks:peer 2      Overall, this is a good essay. You have some interesting ideas here, and you kept my attention. A question that I have: Are some of these ideas from Paglia? If so you need to show the reader which ones are hers. Good luck in the course.peer 4      I think your ideas are very good, but they would come across as more powerful if you orginsed your writing a little bit.peer 5      Most enjoyable, thank you!

With the transfer of blood symbolizing the act. Jonathan Harker describes the female vampires in the castle as ""deliberately voluptuous"" and compares them to his innocent fiance, Mina, saying they have nothing in common. Pre-vampire Lucy is described as innocent and beautiful. When trying to save her, Arthur states that ""the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride"" and later, Van Helsing laughs at the fact that ""... this so sweet a maid is a polyandrist"" and he himself is a ""bigamist"" since Lucy had relieved blood from all the men, and Van Helsing was a widower. Something about women being tainted by the attentions of men here doesn't lead me to think of feminism. ;Wow, that is crazy. I've evaluated 7 essays so far, and thank goodness none of them were that long. It does seem unfair. I think those of you who have unluckily received the long assignments should absolutely note it in the content section of your grading. If I get a long one on the next assignment, I will mark them down for it. There are guidelines for a reason. ;This is kind of interesting, coming out of Singapore: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/singapore-fairytales-warn-declining-fertility. The government is using modernized versions of older fairytales to encourage the citizens to get married and start having babies earlier. Citizens here meaning ""women"", as one pamphlet is quoted as stating """"the extended  adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women""  and the story ends with a stark warning: ""After 40, [fertility] drops  95%.""But that's not exactly what you've asked. I think today there is a prevailing modern fairytale that we can ""have it all"". There is some mythical family out there that has everything they want; money, kids, exciting and lucrative careers, travel, a healthy bedroom life, and time to do all of those things well without having a nervous breakdown. ;If they didn't follow the guidelines, I would mark them a 1 for content, and tell them why in a hopefully nice and constructive way. Maybe even give them a short example of what their paper should have looked like. ;Ive noticed that in classic literature, such as in Dracula, there is more of a slow burn to the conclusion - lots of exposition and details before the climax, told at a slower pace. Compare that to something newer like The Hunger Games* where the pace is very fast and there are many climactic moments before the big one. Which would you say you prefer?   *not comparing the merits of the literature, just the writing style;I wasn't meaning to directly compare those two books specifically, more just giving examples of the two sort of extremes that I was noticing.

I read his being bitten as what caused his mania. Unlike the women, he knew what was happening to him and almost welcomed it, however, he was very concerned about his soul. The eating of the increasingly larger animals was him fulfilling his hunger for blood, while working up to the inevitable task of biting a human. He still shies away from actually biting Dr. Seward, content to cut him and drink the doctor's blood off of the floor. You can also see that the vampire has some kind of psychic hold over Renfield, causing him to escape.

I was so excited to hear just the things I've learned.for a few months already. Prof Rabkin was right when he said Germany initiated the war. At 1864 Bismarck called to unite Germany by 'blood and iron', so they initiated a war with Denmark and used the way as an excuse to untie the northern Germany countries. Same thing goes for the center Germany countries at 1866 with the war against Austria and same for the southern countries with the French war at 1870. The most amazing thing is that Germany didn't experience even one failure through their national struggle.     ;I don't think the Grimm brothers built the nazi empire.

People had a problem with seeing the little Jew who was always more  inferior than them suddenly grow into an equal position, and sometimes succeeding more than them.  Antisemitism  spread not only in Germany, but also in France and Russian just as well. For example, there were enormous pogroms  in 1881, 1903 and more.

That being said, some people in this thread brought up good points in saying that looking up supplemental information can be useful. For example, if you do not understand the material fully or would like to find a ""starting point"" for your essay and are having trouble, looking elsewhere might give you the push that you need. Although, this could pose a problem in the sense that once you have been influenced by supplemental materials, your essay now becomes less genuine, in a sense, and you are using the ideas of others to produce your interpretation.  So essentially, there are two very strong sides to this issue. I think it depends on everyone's own personal preference. I myself do not plan to use any outside resources but at the same time, I am not totally against it depending on circumstance.  ;Very well said Joshua!;Thanks, Josh.

In today's day and age, we, as entertainment consumers, expect a much higher level of quality and polish from our stories than what the Brothers Grimm wrote in that book.   I know it is a translation done in the 1800's when literacy was still gaining momentum in society, so just having those stories in print was fancy and so the translation was as literally direct as possible.   This leads to storytelling conventions we would accept from a child, but not from a publisher, such as what seems to be an unnecessary continuation of the tale past its natural conclusion. The Frog Prince, specifically, comes to mind as at the end of the story, after he is restored to human form, there is his footman, who was never previously mentioned, has a personal event which, by the way it reads, seems to me like a last minute addition tacked on to the story.   This book gets a pass only on the justification that it is the first printing of these stories which are the basis of many works of fiction today.   If anyone tried to pull something like that in today's world, it would be edited out so fast, it just wouldn't be worth the time typing it.Bottom line: yes.   Fairy tales exist today.

Knowing the culture in which it was written, since it's apparently so very different than mine of here and now, may very well give me the proper mental framework to make sense of the writings.   It's like the book is a big inside joke with me on the outside not getting it.   I need it explained to me in context.;I am not intentionally aligning with anyone but myself.   I speak for nobody but myself.   I do think that telling anyone that they should leave the course is constructive in any way.   I said this book was ""driving me crazy"", not that ""I can't deal with it.""   In fact, I said I would still process it and finish my assignment.   Hiding behind an ""Anonymous"" cloak shows paranoia if you are doing it to avoid reprisal.   I am not a vengeful person.   The worst I'll do to anyone here is...   dum dum DUM...   give your comment a down vote! (Oh the horror!)   I'm not going to tell anyone how to live their life, but I will say that I give ""Anonymous"" posts less consideration than those willing to own their words with an identity.   For that matter, how do I know you are the same Anonymous as the Anonymous three comments before?   I could post as Anonymous just after this post apologizing to myself profusely for whatever reasons I dream up, and nobody would be able to disprove the allegations.   By signing my posts with my login, the credibility of my posts are verified.   Nobody else may post as me.   Anonymous has no such validation.   Those are my thoughts, take them as they are.;Agreed, Stephanie.   Perhaps a unique alias would help the situation.   A screen-name one could use for this course alone and then dispose.   Even a  Student1234 style username would be unique to the setting yet anonymous enough to not fear physical stalking provided you don't provide personal information in any of your posts.   Just thinking out loud.   It's up to the site designers to implement it if they so choose.;I like that there was no original answer.   It fits with the rules-be-damned style of the book.   The fact that people demanded an answer, required closure even, supports my own feelings that this book was intentionally written in a style contrary to common thinking.;Unhelpful, Luis.   She is dealing with processing her emotions.   Help her with explanation so she can be enriched from the book.I hear you, Suzanne.   I'm personally dealing with Alice's Adventures myself if you've read some of the other threads.   It doesn't make sense to me.   However, I'm hearing that you are dealing with an emotional hurdle of the horrific actions of some characters.   I don't know if it'll help, but here goes:   They are only stories.   These events did not actually happen.I say these things not to trivialize how you feel, but to offer a bypass of those reactions to allow you to see and think about the other aspects of the readings.   For what it's worth, I agree with you.   Those actions are monstrous and no civil world would allow such things to take place.   To be offended by it?   It's not worth the effort.   You may not like it, nobody can make you feel otherwise.   But to ask others to feel as you do is just as futile.   I'm sure some others do.   But for now... it's just a story.   Pure fiction.;That's odd.   I suppose the original poster deleted his comment.To answer the title of this thread, yes and no.   The points are for reputation only and can be seen by clicking the link for ""top posters"" at the bottom of the forum's page.   Does it count towards the class grade?   I don't think so.    It's sort of an ego/participation meter.   But there you go.;HA!;I'm yet another descendant of those colonial separatists.   And I freely admit that our english is not  (capital E)  English.I had my share of nursery rhymes growing up, but not so much British literature.   I started out with Encyclopedia Brown books which then led me to read  The Complete Sherlock Holmes and The Lord of the Rings.   Boy oh boy are those dry reads for a 10-year old!   I went back to The Three Investigators series, sponsored by Alfred Hitchcock, which were more appropriate for my age then.   Forced by the then semi-competent public school system to read assorted Charles Dickens novels (he was paid by the word, I hear) I actually grew to dislike the British writing style until Terry Pratchett happened on the scene with his Discworld novels.   Funny story:   I got the first two books of the series by accident when I was late in returning the slip from the Science Fiction Book Club one month.   When the books arrived, I shrugged and gave them a go.   Liking them, I just chalked it up to ""times have changed"".Summed up regarding the Alice stories:   I'm just out of time and place to appreciate them to their fullest.;        I think visual formatting is important too.   I put 5 spaces before the first word of any paragraph.   Only one ENTER after the final line as the automatic formatting leaves sufficient padding between paragraphs.   And try to make paragraphs at least 3 lines (not necessarily sentences) across the page to please the eye.           Solid blocks of text without paragraphing are to be avoided at all costs. I marked someone as a 1 in the first assignment just for that.   It was hard on my eyes and when I had to blink or look away, it took a large fraction of a second to find my place again.   Yes, it's a small amount of time, but it's annoying.   Proper formatting could have alleviated that.   Make the reader's job easier, already!;You seem to have missed the words ""at least"" in my post.   I'm not advocating short packets of information.   Just the opposite.;It was about four o'clock in the afternoon and the lithe and slimy corkscrew-like lizard-badgerswere spinning and punching holes in the grass plot around the sundial under which they made their home.Flimsy and miserable were all those shabby-looking birds with their feathers sticking out all around like a live mopand the green pigs who lost their way home were making some kind of bellowing, wheezing, sneezing sound.(It makes much more sense reading it this way, but it's not poetic.)  ;There does not necessarily have to be an author's intention involved when selecting a theme.   It's just your point of view as a reader.   In fact, there are probably many subconscious themes in most works if you believe the psychologists throughout the ages. Relax and give us whatever insights you have.   If you can defend them successfully, I see no reason you would get bad marks.;@GusThat's two words.   Sorry, I had to do it...   :P;""Never imagine yourself""Do not think of yourself""not to be otherwise"" (a double negative)to be anything but""what it might appear to others""what others see you as""that what you were or might have been""due to your true self""was not otherwise than what you had been"" (another double negative)which would be the same""would have appeared to be otherwise.""unless you looked differently to others.Further condensing the sentence:   Think of yourself as others perceive you to be due to your true self.Further condensing and inverting the of sentence (putting the negatives, double and otherwise, back into it):   Don't pretend to be something you aren't. (a queen in this case)That's how I read it...;Agreed.   It is an intentionally confusing sentence.Likewise, nullifying double negatives does not always reveal the true intent of a statement.""I am not unhappy"" is not the same as saying ""I am happy.""There are going to be numerous takes on what that particular sentence means.;I'm starting to read Dracula.   The approach of telling the story through multiple first-person perspectives is a significant shift from the 3rd person stories we have read in this course so far.   I personally know some people who deride first person narratives as having too narrow a perspective and others who say it enhances the immersion.   The only gripe I have with it is that you know the storyteller will survive the whole of the book, barring any epilogue.   Dracula overcomes this by having multiple narratives, and I applaud this approach.   I'm going to cop-outSo my question at large is:   which style do you prefer best and why?   I'm going to cop-out and say that I have no preference as long as it's executed well.;Most people I talk to who are voracious readers often agree with my description that when I read, I visually ""see"" the scene playing out in my head as I read the words.   I'm so far past sounding out words, that meaning just seems to flow into my brain as my eyes scan the lines.   So yes, first, third, over-the shoulder third (like many video games), etc...   do affect how my mind visualizes the scene.There is a book by John Steakley called Armor that swaps back and forth between 1st and 3rd person.   The author is now deceased, but if done right, I think the book would make an excellent movie.;This sounds like a sales pitch.   You've pitched this once before in another thread that's now buried.   I do not think this is appropriate behavior for the course.   Otherwise, I like your style.;I think you suffer a bit from rushing through it.   I had the same reaction as you, but I finished the reading early on and had the better part of a week to digest it all before I wrote my essay.   I'm better for it, but those books still aren't my favorites by a long shot. But it's all been discussed in this other thread I started:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=288;I assume this class has a high attrition rate early on.   Several posts of the frenetic pace and workload have been made.   More posts are made fretting about the grading scheme or grades received.   If egos are of any concern, I expect the attrition rate to continue at a rapid pace until about the halfway point where it will level off or, at least, dwindle to a trickle.As people fall off the rosters and only those devoted to making the efforts to stay in the course remain, I fully expect the quality of writing to improve by several orders of magnitude.   That's my prediction anyway.;Agreed.   3 of the 5 essays I just graded had no clear thesis.   Naturally, the thoughts were not focused and wandered about.   In one essay alone, I pointed out 3 separate topics that each would make a good thesis, but were not supported with a reference.   I felt a little draconian handing out so many 1's, but that's what they earned.   Hopefully , they will take my recommendations to heart and improve their form and focus.;"

So I think he can get about during daylight hours if he must.;Strange rule.   Even my son's friends know better that to try that!   But then again, I live in a city.   My rule is: unless I gave you a key, there better be some knocking first! (Or doorbell, but you get the point.)But I don't make the rules governing vamps...;I can let a mistake or two go without hurting the grade.   I've noticed that the essay entry box does not flag spelling errors like, say, the forum input boxes do.   But seriously, if everyone would at least cut / paste their essay into a word processor and run spell-check / grammar-check, many of the problems would be fixed.   If someone doesn't have MS Word, they can get Open Office Writer for free.   I'm sure there are any number of free online services available as well.   I just implore that people check their work somehow before submitting it.   Of course, the rub is that there are likely hundreds of people who don't participate on these forums that won't hear my plea...;Agreed.   Prof. Rabkin stated somewhere that the suggested text is considered to be common knowledge and does not need to be cited.   As such, other editions need to be cited if used as they are not considered to be the suggested text because they, like you said, may have supplemental material such as prefaces or annotations not present in the course-suggested text.   (Breathe!) Contrariwise, citing the  course-suggested text, while not necessary, should not be counted against the essay's form either.   It's not hurting anything by being there, right?So just to be safe, I cite everything.;One thing I'm liking in Dracula is the diverse accents used by the characters.   Most of the players are proper British, but there is Dracula himself who speaks excellent English, but has a few syntax flaws (of which he is very aware) to distinguish him as a foreigner.   Likewise, the old fisherman speaks a very course version of English that I'd say is very probable to give some non-native English speakers some trouble when reading it. (And even some native ones too!)   The game warden of the zoo speaks a low version of British (Cockney?) where ""h"" is often dropped from the beginning of words that usually have them and occasionally added to words that don't.   (My Fair Lady explains this phenomenon better)   Van Helsing, being Dutch, speaks his English with the sentence structure of his native tongue which also distinguishes him as a foreigner.   What's hilarious to me, though, is the Texan who courts Lucy.   His language goes way beyond American English into ridiculous wild-western buzzwords so much that it almost becomes unintelligible again.   But it serves its purpose for character development.Not my essay.   Just my thoughts today.;Dutch is a derivative of the West Germanic language.   That, and Van Helsing seems well-travelled.   I'm sure some idioms are naturally favored by him.;Indeed.   Only one commentator of the 4 who reviewed my essay left useful comments.   The other 3 ""phoned it in"" with useless comments like ""Good job"" and the like.   NONE of them left general comments for improvement in the third section.   NONE!   Blank!   It's difficult to improve without meaningful feedback.   I try to give good service to those essays I review.   I write, with examples, somewhere between 3 to 5 lines in each section.   The last section I use to recapitulate the first two sections in what I intend to be a friendly conversational voice.   So yes, please make good faith efforts to give meaningful reviews of essays just as you want the same for the essay on which you made good efforts to complete and submit on time.;I'm leaning toward this train of thought as well.   I do not mind peer reviews, but I'd much rather review and be reviewed by those I consider to be my intellectual  peers and not anonymous people.   I admit it's snobbish of me to think that I'm better than any group of people...   but I am.   I know there are many of my co-students in this course with which I would happily converse and freely exchange essays.   But there are many that I'm sure haven't even bothered to log in to these discussion boards that are still submitting work of which I have the displeasure of reviewing.   Honestly, I will take someone's opinion to heart much more readily if I have a relationship, even if it is just a name, over the faceless ""Anonymous"".   (The above poster does not count as she signed it ""Lori"". Thanks!)As such, since there is no overt affect on my life from submitting essays, (not that anyone else besides Coursera staff would know if I did or not) I am on the fence as to if I will make the effort to submit any more.   I will keep thinking about the readings as if I were to submit essays as that is the point of the course.   I have a decision to make before noon tomorrow...;Joanna, you play to my ego and it is a good move.   I hastily wrote something down for Dracula.   I admit it won't be my best work, but it's still better than some essay's I've read.   If I can be of service through providing examples of well-composed essays (at least in form if not always in content) then I will happily do so.   I'll leave it to my imagination to suppose that others are actually improving through exposure to my prose.Wow!   I haven't written something that self-aggrandizing in...   ever!   I'm going to slink off now and put my ego in check.;You made me think.   I couldn't remember if I used ""I"" in my essays.   It turns out, I didn't.   Scores 4 and 4.5 so far.   As Katrina mentioned, writing with an assertive voice as an authority on the subject will help.   I find that it naturally precludes the use of ""I"".;You could have written: ""The five examined patients..."" or""Upon examining five patients...""  or""Of the five patients examined...""The English language is extraordinarily flexible.   There is almost always a way to rephrase a clause to suit a purpose.;It is the influence of modern times (American?) that stories now climax with a ""boss fight"" like in video games.   It gives a clear rush of action and a decisive victor to the story.   You can usually tell who's going to win, too.   I think the movie dragged out the ending more dramatically.   I'll have to watch it again sometime.That being said: I liked how the book ended.   It said that Drac (he let's me call him Drac) got a look of triumph as the sun set in that instant before he was slain.   Had the men acted an instant later, Drac might haved turned to mist and escaped destruction.   Yes, Van Helsing had sealed his castle from him, but that being his homeland, I'm sure Drac could have found another place to hide and rally.   The story ended about as logically well as a fantasy novel could hope for.;While it has been remarked in another thread that Van Helsing's Dutch accent isn't convincing to someone who knows an authentic Dutch accent, I do like that there is an innocent mistranslation between language and culture.   While ""bloomin"" and ""bloody"" are swear words in the British culture, as an American, those particular words hold little shock value to me.   To see them represented by Van Helsing's quote of ""with bloom upon them and also with blood"" just removes the shockingness of the epithet even more.   Yes, I chuckled when I read it.   I do enjoy a good muddle of the English language when done for amusement purposes.   (Stoker's intent, not Van Helsing's.);Agreed.   I'm down to throwing out *A* point with *A* piece of evidence.   It does feel more like ""food for thought"" rather than making a grand, deep, statement.;From a psychological perspective, I'd venture to say that by including references to famous works of literature, an author attempts to legitimize their own reputation as a person of education and intelligence.   It shows that they are, at the least, literate, and possibly even well-read.   Why re-invent the wheel if you can steal one from an old cart, right?   In any case, in Dracula, all the parts are told in first person perspective forcing a certain point of view.   This means that all narrative comes from the mind of an individual character at any given time and can be used for character development.   If that character cares to quote from an earlier work to show familiarity of it, then so be it.   I think the references are used effectively in Dracula.;I did not detect any ""homo"" angles in Dracula.   That's more than can be said for anything by Anne Rice, though.   She took that angle and owned it in her books.;I admit, it has been a while since I read those chapters.   The last chapters are still the freshest in my mind.;Good discussion!   Even Van Helsing obliquely acknowledges that vampires predate Christianity in referring to his research of old legends.   So it follows that the articles of faith used to ward of Dracula gain their powers from the devoutness and certainty of the people placing the articles.   So...   If Van Helsing was an atheist (he wasn't, of course) and did not believe in the authenticity of the sacraments he was using, would they still have worked?   What articles of faith worked BEFORE the rise of Christianity?I have mentioned Terry Pratchett in other threads as a favorite author of mine.   The book Carpe Jugulum deals with faith most humorously in relation to vampires.   (Carpe Jugulum  literally translates to ""Seize the Jugular"" and loosely translates to ""Go for the Throat"".) Enjoy.;Is there something wrong with that photo at the top of the article?   It looks like his head is sliding up off the top of his beard...;"

I know, he  s supposed to have been a genious, and me being Argentinian and everything maybe I should like him more. I don  t. I just don  t. And I  m well-read. But I don  t fancy Borges. Just like some people don  t fancy Alice in Wonderland. And that  s ok. Just try to keep an open mind though. I know I do... even with Borges. :);genius... not genious... Dear me, I  ve forgotten how to spell... It  s all downhill from here. :);Hahahahahahha!! I agree!!;If they are already in the pens move around with one pig   until you go full circle.

You will always be closer to ten the more you turn. Until they are all in the pens  That  s my guess. It  s probably wrong, I don  t know.  ;I found this on the web.

I felt sad for Lucy, and also very frustrated as I watched her struggle to live.   I feel really sorry for her. I also feel very sorry for Renfield too. In a way, Dracula, for me, is a novel about what evil can do to people and how when you least expect it, something bad happens and clouds your happiness.   ;Mary, you are right! You talk about speed and that  s true! I marvelled on how very fast-paced and packed with excitement Dracula is. And I like what you say about science and faith. Very romantic period, isn  t it? I read the other day that Dracula is also considered an invasion novel. I liked that idea, even if invasion novels deal more with the invasion of armies and the like. But I thought it might be an interesting idea. It shows a fear of foreigners and what they represent.   What do you think?;That  s ok, horror is supposed to do that! In a way you live the story.

Your overall grade is the average of your highest seven essay grades.The essay marks are based on the peer evaluations. Each essay should be evaluated by approximately 5 peers, and the mark you get allocated for the essay is based on the mark they each give you out of six. I can't remember if it's the median mark of the five grades, or the average after removing the highest and lowest.Peer marking isn't always the best solution but in this case there are  far too many of us for the uni staff to mark them all personally. I think the principle of having multiple markers and only needing to complete 7 essays to pass is that any extreme marking gets cancelled out and if you're really unlucky with your peer-markers one week then at least that shouldn't affect your overall course mark too much.

Just curious, I am a great fan.;I don  t know why this obsession with England...Bram stoker was Irish.;Who knows...I spend most of the day in an alcoholic stupor.;ALICE IN WONDERLAND AND THE DRUG CULTURE.  Alice in Wonderland has given plenty of inspiration to drug related movements, or scenarios. For example we have the song Go Ask Alice, by Jefferson Airplane, where we can find a clear allegory of drugs.In this song "" One pill makes you larger, one pill makes you small"", and then "" tell them a hoocah smoking caterpillar has given you the call "".During the 90s, Xtasy pills became the drug of choice in discos and the club scene. Popular types of pills included Alice, Mad Hatters, White Bunnies, Caterpillars, etc. They coined terms like ""a trip to Wonderland costs 10 pounds"".  I think this association of Alice in Wonerland with the drug scene is due to the unique style and originality of the work. But at a closer look, there's nothing really remotely close to drugs in Alice in Wonderland. The Caterpillar was smoking   hoocah, yes,   but it was common in Victorian England to smoke hookas, pipes, cigars, etc. the British Empire reached far away countries, and trade with those place made common to find in Londos all sort of products, including opium, which was perfectly normal n those times, it was not stigmatized in those times.  The changes in Alice's size, it's a metaphor of the changes a child undregoes as s/he grows up. The child is not aware of his gradual growth, until one day he realizes s/hes no longer a child, and society and fmily starts treating them as teenagers, or ""small adults"". This causes confusion, stuppor, fear....teens are no longer kids nor adults, they experiment sudden changes in their bodies. Alice in Wonderland is a guide to help kids navigate through life. Life is weird sometimes, shocking, exciting...life is the smile of a Chesire cat, life a beutiful garden full of soldiers and life is all that the imagination can come up with, that's why Alice in Wonderland is today as popular as it was a century ago.Works cited:Go Ask Alice, by Jefferson Airplane.Alice in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll.FORMpeer 1     There were a number of grammatical errors in your paper as well as a couple of typos.

Also, the first sentence of your concluding paragraph would be more grammatically correct if written as ""The changes in Alice's size is a metaphor for the changes a child undergoes transitioning into adulthood.""  I would omit ""s/he"" from essays in the future.

Yet halfway along your essay you seem to forget the title. So here is a comment on structure, which can be improved. Also you have some spelling - issues in your essay and I think you could easily have gotten this right if you checked the text thoroughly before submitting it. For instance: hoocah, hookas,place in stead f places, Londos in stead of London, n in stead of in.Now it looks like though you rushed and didn't take the time to go over your essay again. Maybe you did, and that would be a shame.peer 5     First of all, there are a lot of typos or words written wrong, plus some of the sentences are not quite grammatically correct. The essay doesn't seem to lay out clearly its argument, the first three paragraphs are about Alice and drug culture and the last one is about something totally unrelated.CONTENTpeer 1     I found your essay very fascinating.  The dreamlike state of Wonderland is often compared to a drug-induced state in popular culture, despite the fact that this was not Carroll's intention.  Your insights, however, were difficult to follow, as you had no clear thesis statement.  Here is a link to a site full of useful information relating to essay writing: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/545/01/ This particular page walks writers through properly formulating a thesis statement.peer 2     While I think the essay made some really interesting points, but it wasn't really a literary criticism of the novels. It focused more on historical references to the books. Try to focus solely on what is in the books.peer 3     It was very interesting reading this, because I learned so much , for instance I didn't knew the drug history. Maybe you could have included a quote from the book to show an example of ""society and fmily starts treating them as teenagers, or ""small adults"" .peer 4     You start your essay by giving it a title. In the opening sentences you talk about the influence Alice in Wonderland has had on the drug scene, but halfway your essay you seem to forget all about the tittle and you end by saying that the book helps kids navigate through life. So your conclusion has got nothing to do with your title and opening. Thus, I think you could improve your train of thought/your argumentation and logic by staying on the subject and telling us what you think about 'Alice in wonderland and the drug culture.' After reading your essay I have learned that AAW was an inspiration in songs and the name of drugs. This is nice to know, and interesting, but what are you trying to say/prove exactly?  peer 5     I feel that the author of the essay had this thesis (a pretty obvious one) in mind before reading Carroll's book. I won't dare to say that he/she never read the books but this is what it seems, that the argument is constructed around what everybody knows about Alice. The essay actually says nothing about the books, it talks about drug culture (present and Victorian) and its circumstantial relation with Carroll's work, but no more than that. A poor essay for two rich books. A pity.COMMENTSpeer 1     I highly recommend checking out the Purdue OWL website.  I use this site like an essay-writing bible.

Next time, maybe you should focus a bit more on you're grammar .peer 4     In fact, I think you should delete the last part of your essay and rewrite it so that it comes back to the opening (the drug scene) again and you should close with an original thought which would linger in the readers mind for a while.;I am.

Or was it just a random coincidende?, and he just happened to like that name?I've googled the name Wilhelmina, and seems a popular name, there's several places in the English speaking countries called like that.what do you think?;Randomness is part of life, as is chaos and nihilism.Of course an author is gonna give a lot of thought to any single word on the text, but unless Bram Stoker himself said ""I chose Willhelmina to reflect strong opposition to Dracula"" it wont be but an interpretation.

I must admit I wrote it in a rush, it took me around 10 minutes the whole thing, that's why is a bit weak,;t's okay sweetie, you did a good job. To tell you the truth, I improvised the whole thing.

Dracula has multiple meanings and nuances. It's the story of the paranoia of the British people, about being invaded by ""dark"" continental Europe. In the time it was written, late eighteenth century, the British Empire was the main superpower in the world, and as such, people tended to perceive unexistent threats from the conquered countries. The conqueror always fears the latent thirst for revenge from the conquered.   Count Dracula represents the perils of the foreigner...the evil  who lurks in the shadows of the night, ready to feed on the blood of the British citizens.Another perspective, would lead us to see  sexual imaginery. The neck is one of the most vulnerable - and   erotic - parts of  a woman's body.  When a man makes love to a woman, the woman tends to raise her chin and offer her neck...it's a proof of trust, by  offering   her neck, she  implies   her submission to the man, her willingness to be taken by him in an unreserved way. Nothing is as enticing and encouraging for a man who is mounting  an aroused   woman, than seing   her offering her neck in an unreserved way. By killing Dracula, Bram Stoker possibly made a point in support of women's right. Remember than in those days, women could not even vote, and were little more than sexual slaves in many aspects.An equally interesting reading is about how a group of people react to  a danger. Jonathan Harker could have focused on saving his neck (no pun intended) and forget about the whole thing as soon as he was out of danger's way. But he spared no effort until Dracula and his harem of female vampires were destroyed. And they were willing to risk their own lives. How close this social commintment to a cause is related to the cause of Irish independence from the United Kingdom is a valid hypothesis of specualation, since Bram Stoker was an Irish supporter of the independence.FORMpeer 1     The text seemed written correctly in grammar question, but I think it lacked coherence. The first and last paragraph would make more sense together, opening the text with the second.peer 2     I struggled with whether or not to give a 1 or 2 on this essay for format and finally decided a 2 would be overly generous, but a 1 would be too harsh. The writing itself is not bad and the writer did do a good job of breathing their own personality into the writing (something that can be very difficult in an essay format). There are several errors in spelling and grammar that really should have been attended to (imaginery is probably the most flagrant of these). Be more careful in the future -- your essays will be all the better for it!peer 3     Your grammer is very good, but the structure of your essay leaves something to be desired. Our assignment is to write one short paragraph on one aspect we found intriguing, not offer multiple different perspectives.peer 4     Using three different perspectives was a unique idea from others that I have read.  The structure, grammar, word usage and the arguments were stated fairly clearly and well defined.  I was able to follow where you were leading me.  You cited some British history that made some facts a little clearer.  Overall the form is pretty good.  You can always work to make it better.CONTENTpeer 1     I founded the very question of conquest and conquered. However, the second point of view, women, it seems a little forced on the issue of defense and right on the issue of sexuality. Could have opened with this text - women - and made a continuation between the beginning (first paragraph) and end (last).peer 2     An essay should be prepared to expound and defend a unified statement about a text. Especially if you're limited in word count as our course is. In the future, it might be wise to assume that if you can explain and give evidence enough to support your point in a single paragraph, you have not allowed yourself to venture far enough in your mental meanderings. I hope you discover new insights in our upcoming readings and that you enjoy the process of helping your peers encounter those wise revelations with you as the communicating medium!peer 3     Overall, you have some good points. But, as I stated before, your lack of focus (and of a thesis statement) detracts a great deal from your essay. This essay is all over the place, and failed to fulfill the assignment.peer 4     The content of this essay was divided into three equal sections.  Each section covered a different topic.  The first topic covered the paranoia of the British people of the eighteenth century and how people dealt with the ideas expressed during that time.  The. Second topic concerned the sexual aspect of Dracula.  While the third topic covers how people deal with danger.  I think all topics were covered well  with  arguments from our readings.  COMMENTS  peer 3     Point of fact: Dracula was written in the late nineteenth century, not the eighteenth.peer 4     The essay gave me several new thoughts to reflect upon once this class is over.  Right now there is still much more reading to finish.Score: 3.5;Very good essay, Celine. Both Dracula and Christ died by the cross, so it would make sense that Dracula resurrected too, in/through the  womb of Mina.Christ had his apostles, Dracula had gypsies. (no offence to gypsies, but that's how were they portrayed in those times)Christ went to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel , Dracula went to London, the capital of the British Empire.Christ versus Maria Magdalene; Dracula versus Mina.;Some women   gave birth to Adolph Hitler, Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, Ariel Castro, etc. Women produce monsters on a daily basis, maybe if men had a change to give birth they would not do a worse job.;"

I would had given you a 3 for form, since I didn  t spot any spelling, or grammar mistake (but since I am an ESL, I can  t be completely sure)And a 2 for content. Your essay was interesting, but the part of regional dialects and accents seem too far fetched. Somebody from Glasgow could have a perfectly clear conversation with somebody from Los Angeles...or two guys from the same city could feel worlds apart, it's not the accent, or regional dialect what makes   people feel close or distant to/from another fellow human, its their own mindset, their intellectual similarity.I agree that for a non speaker would be harder, and will have a hard time getting an idiom, but as soon as he learns the meaning of that particular idiom, or expression, that info will remain stable in his memory, ie, they can evolve and learn.Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Wonderland, seemed to lack this capability to evolve, they seem to live in a permanent world of nonsense and paradox, so appealing  for   children, and sometimes so irritating for adults. That's why some adults find Alice a tiresome reading.Just a little comment about your idiom example. Since we are commenting a children's book, you could have used a less technological one, for example ""it's raining cats and dogs"", wich is funny and more in tune with Alice, rather than one about ghosts and computers. But this is just my personal opinion, sweetie pie.Let's see if our essays cross paths again, bella ragazza.;Edgar Allan Poe used to get some booze left on his grave....a few years ago, this event suddently ended. so it was speculated that the mysterious fan had died.I would replace him gladly if I lived in Baltimore.;Did I request thee, Maker, from my clayTo mould Me man? Did I solicit theeFrom darkness to promote me?    Those lines belong to Milton, in Paradise Lost. They belong to Adam, the first man who walked on Earth .  We don  t know why we are here. Somebody, or something created us.  Or perhaps it was just a random event in the big universe. Some people accept it, and try to live their short  lifespan on Earth as good as they can. Others don  t accept it, they can  t accept to be somebody's creation, thus embarking in a personal crusade to create themselves life.  This is the case of Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the eponym ""creature"", and title of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. He failed. He thought he could create human life by adding a few limbs and bones and tissues. But humans are more than the sum of their parts, and the ""monster"" refused to be a mere puppet in doctor Frankestein  s hands.  He demands, what all humans want: love. So he asks his creator to provide him a companion, a female version, a girlfriend. In the meantime, he shows that there's no boundaries when there is faith: he teaches himself to talk and read.But drama, so human, so pervading in society does not   wait too much to make its presence: Victor Frankenstein destroys the female version, and the monster murders in revenge Elizabeth, the wife of Doctor Frankenstein.  Blood for blood. Creator and created represent the bond of madness and violence that connects humankind. They sepend their last days chasing each other, reaching the North Pole. Creator and created  feed on  each other's hate, they are the ying and yang of life.No matter how, when man plays to be god, he will always lose the battle.FORMpeer 1     You were a bit clumsy in language and syntax, but maybe English not your native language?    To create    themselves life    isn   t correct, and I am not sure what it means.  'As well as we can    is preferable to    as good as we can    .Frankenstein, not the monster, is the eponymous person in the novel. That said there are plenty of ideas herepeer 2     There  is some  clumsy  phrasing--""when  man  PLAYS TO BE GOD""  but  on  tthe  whole  the  form  is  adequate.peer 3     Well structured essay, contains a few typos and minor gramtical errors.peer 4     The essay is well structured and easily read, attributing to its form. There aren't any significant grammar mistakes and major ideas are presented logically and in an orderly fashion.CONTENTpeer 1     You show that you have read the book carefully and choose to focus on the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation. I liked your description of them as the yin and yang. Not sure about a    bond of madness and violence connecting mankind   . Rather a negative view? peer 2     Your  thesis  was  not  clear  to  me.  Calling  Frankenstein  and the  Monster  yin  and  yang  seems  to  me  to  be  a  misunderstanding  of  both.  I  liked  the  quote  from  Milton  and  I  am  sorry  the  essay  did  not  expand  on  it  in  a  cklear  and  convincing  way.peer 3     Good choice of topic, which could be analysed more thoroughly.peer 4     The content of the essay is interesting and provides the reader with some intriguing insights into the essence of the novel. Distinct concepts and arguments are divided and presented adequately and convincingly.TATAL SCORE: 4;Thanks, Florencia.;The USA is the current superpower, so they call the shots. They say frog, the rest of the world jump. And I like it that way, I prefer American English than British  English any day of the week, it's much more clear and easy to understand. Americans tend to be more laid back and open than British people, so ESL students tend to choose American Englih over British English.Sorry mate, there's nothing we can do...British English is  a   joke compared to American English.;It's you the one who should have something constructive to say, and post your essay and the comments in particular so people can  judge for themselves about something tangible.But instead, you ask professor Rabkin to address the issue, like if he had magical powers, and he can change the world  ,just because you have some general,  ambigous, concern about any subject in particular.Just my 2 cents.;What part of America are you from? Brazil? Canada? Argentine? USA?Maybe I am naive, but I prefer the USA to anywhere else in Europe (except for Scandinavia) any day of the week. ;I love that tv program about that pawn shop in Detroit . It's rehearsed as hell, but they make it look natural. I love the father -son tensi _n, and the ""evil sister""...she's a bit ugly, but I like her.Wasn  t Robocop filmed in Detroit? Epic movie. It's a good example of sci-fiction that could be discussed in this course: human versus   machine interaction. In that case, quite literal.;The only one with a condesceding attitude was the OP, asking professor Rabkin to intercede and   ""educate"" the ignorants who were not aware of the greatness of the ""real English"".The rest of English forms are unreal?  I'd love Spain to have an Empire in Latin America and brag about it....but I can  t,   it's long gone, and Spain is just a joke in an international level. One must accept the present state of affairs, and move on.The British language was important in the past, Shakespeare and all that stuff, but nowadays everybody has American English as a guide, we must accept it.;Hola bro. No te enfades, lo he dicho un poco de broma, la verdad es que le tengo un poco de man _a a todo lo brit  nico...no es nada personal.;I think you mean ""British English"", which is the type of English  used in Great Britain.All types of English accents are real, by the way.;Okay then. ""all types of English usages are real"".;i was taught British English at school....when I grew up I  became aware that   you have to pick winning horses in this life , so I quit that ""colour"" nonsense and  adopted ""color"". And of course ""gotten"" instead of ""got"". It was a smooth, natural move.  you can  t fight progress.;I  think this whole thread is a 9/10....too much ado about nottin'.;I would not. In fact, I   love her sarcasm. And she is right, you just need to post your essay and let people see for themselves. But no, that would be too easy....much better go around making drama.;Be a man, and post your essay. Professor Rabkin is not your personal nanny.Off the record, since you comment about my English, it happens to be ESL, and I use to get lower scores on the form , . but I don  t complain about it, since the mastery and geniality of the content makes up for it.;So are you inside my mind, now? I just want to see the cause of so much commotion. There's around 50.000 people taking this course. Do you seriously think professor Rabkin is not aware there's all sort of bias and irregularities in the peer grading system?   Your dramatic victimization is just funny.There's many Americans taking this course. If you post your essay and point at the problematic / controversial words, you can know first hand what an American thinks about the correctness of that particular word, or sentence, and an interesting debate could follow.Who knows, maybe even myself got something interesting and useful to say that will increase your understanding on the English language.Why are you so scared? You are posting anonymously,, anyways.;Hi Dani. Yes, I've seen you around....I didn  t want to mention it, but I think there's some sexual tension going on. I am glad you make the first move, there's so many birds around, I can  t keep track of them all.Unfortunately, my hands are tied right now, I am undergoing a rehab program, the judge was clear   "" no fooling around with the ladies, for a couple of months"".But drop me an e-mail enyways, I'll see what I can do...just let's keep a low profile. ;);#NAME?;Baby...Olga is just a friend. no need for a catfight over me!!;Wow, mate, your interest has taken a radical turn from the wonders of the British English to the ins and outs of my humble existence. Inflatable dolls? Barrio Chino? Dude, I know you are a coward who   don  t have guts to post an essay, but you don  t need to reach those lenghts to create a smoke screen.I don  t know who Olga is, but she seems friendly, ergo she is my friend. An anonymous guy talking about anonymous games? Sweet irony.Anyways...this whole thread is just a storm in a teapot, don  t lose your breath over it.PS, it's no longer called barrio chino, it's called Raval nowadays.;Not really, I live in the Olympic Village, quite far from the Raval.But mate...I wonder how  is gonna react the average reviewer in future assigments when s/he comes across some Brit giveaway. You are certainly not helping your Brit comrades.Your foolishness is compromising the future work of thousands of British coursera students...good job, mate.;Of course no, Nancy. I don  t have any ""personal feelings"" about anything when I grade a peer. In fact, I use to give max scores if I don  t detect any grammar or spelling mistake. I havent given any lowest score so far.But not everybody is so fair and balanced as myself. Many people can read this thread and get upset by this drama queen and keep a harsh approach at future Brit-looking assigments. That would be sad.;Well, Nancy, a few downvotes here and there are part of the game. I am a big boy,  I can handle it. But saying that  English English is the ""real "" English is a far worse public relations move, so that's why I feel almost certainly some people, especially from former British colonies will retaliate.;Good idea, OP, let's see how you explain you apology of prostitution and comments about rubber dolls.;Good idea, last anonymous. This teapot storm is losing momentum.Nancy, Nancy, Nancy....my dear Nancy. If my memory doesnt fail me, we were ""friends"" for a while, around a month ago. In those ""friendly chats"" you told me things which I wont repeat here, of course, but I almost felt sick. That comment about your upstairs neighbours, and the expression you used to call them made me realize on the spot you are not good news. So please, don  t play now the ""fair play queen"", because I know what kind of prejudiced person you are. But let's leave it there.   I don  t like to remove dirt from the past. I removed  you from my   Facebook list , I don  t  know   why you are back....but I think I was quite clear: we parted ways, sorry.PS, smooth Judas kiss attempt, though. So brilliant.;""Hell has no Wrath like a Woman Scorned'""You always brought out the poet in me, baby.Good luck.xxx.;Anonymous...it's not my fault if you can  t tell the difference between a joke and sexual harrassment. Can  t help you there, mate.This teapot is becoming muddy....the   uglyness is reaching unsavory levels, so I graciously abide you farewell.Good luck with professor Rabkin, mate,   I am sure he'll spend a couple of video lectures addressing your issues.Adios amigos!!;I always suspected you were a bit ""out there"". Thanks for confirming it. Posting this crap wont make you look very mentally balanced, but whatever floats your boat.By the way, you forgot to mention the detail of the race comments about you neighbours and the use of the n-   word. but don, t worry, I am not a nutter who keeps stored old crap.You only hurt yourself.;Cheesscakes....it's my lucky day, I got the nutter jackpot.Okay, I do some *harmless* fun every now and again, some clean fun to release some stress. Big deal. The horror. The horror.But let me tell you something, and this is very serious. If I  had   a  14 year old   son, I'd protect him. I would not talk about him so lightly on forum boards in front of thousands of strangers , and I would not certainly let him talk to strangers in front of a computer with some guy,  like when you introduced us,  like ""mum's new friend"", and I was like ""wtf, is she for real?"". it was totally embarrassing...do you wanna mess his life or what?Don  t know what's your problem, but focus a little bit on being a good mother, stop talking about ""how that people  play the race card"" ,and posting crap from the past like if you were uncovering the new watergate on wikileaks.In other words: GET A LIFE.And don  t worry, I am gonna unregister from this course right now.;Well,  a guy who goes around snatching dead bodies, cutting them into pieces, adding several parts together, and creates   a ""organic   biped""   (I resist calling it monster, it's the romantic in me), and then kills his female version so the poor beast can  t have some decent sex...it's not like he's a saint.The nazi officers who did ""some stuff"" in the concentration camps had families also...were they cool guys?;Ponte en la piel del monstruo por un momento.

No thanks, I like to earn a certificate,not get it like a free giveaway. The Professor was great, but I just don  t see the point of so many quiz attemts, it's just silly. That's why I keep with pride the certificate of Introduction to Psychology, by Professor Smith, from the University of Georgia. There you only had one chance at the quizes; one chance at the final exam,  the   writting assigments, the OLI textbook exercises, mix it all , score 70 % or more,  get   the the darn piece of paper, and hang it on the wall....that's the only way I can find satisfaction from a course, after a serious effort.So I just downloaded all the lectures, and unregistered from Roman Mythology.

I prefer Andersen's stories any day of the week.;I just started reading The Birthmark, and the first sentence struck me as odd:""In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy""I am just an ESL guy, but aint eminent an adjective here? So as such, it should be accompanied  by a noun. For example, ""eminent man"", ""eminent doctor"", etc.If  it works as a noun, it should be eminence,  for example ""Michael is an eminence, proficient in all sort of stuff"", or ""Laura is a Brazilian eminence, proficient in maths"".Maybe it's jut a small detail, but I find it odd to get this at the very first sentence of a text. Is it random, or there's some sort of second meaning?;Another possible way could    turn them both into adjectives of man, like ""a man of science, eminent and proficient in every branch of natural philosophy""I doubt an author like Nathaniel Hawthorn could make such basic mistake. Is this a problem with the edition?Maybe it's silly, but I am the kinda guy who gets obsessed by little details like that, I can  t keep with the reading. HELP!;Okay Sean, thanks. It makes sense some sort of language change due to historical reasons. I found a similar  problem in the Grimm Brothers stories, for example  ""the Wolf waked up"" instead of ""woke up.""   The only thing I know about Nathaniel Hawthorne is that Herman Melville dedicated to him Moby Dick, since they were friends in real life so I  thought he was more ""modern"" than he really is. And I guess I think  Herman  Melville is modern, because he is the great-grandfather of New York singer Richard Melville Hall aka   Moby. It's amazing how the unconscious works. I love Moby, I love Herman Melville, so I guess I am supposed to love Nathaniel Hawthorne, even if it's gonna be a rough  reading.  I got ADD (Atention Deficit Disorder)....one hour ago, I  was totally focused, ready to face The Birthmark like a champ. But it just takes an unexpected distraction and it's all gone, it's gonna take hours to regain a focused state of mind.;I am not joking, I am not reading a single word more of The Birthmark until I get a satisfactory answer....I am gonna barricade in my room, I got enough food   and water to survive for a couple of months, and will drop my waste out the window.Radical problems demand radical solutions.Alea jacta est!!!;Mmmmm, I took a peep and found this, just  a few lines later:   ""  it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy ""It should be ""in its deep and absorbing energy""It's gonna be a bit nerve racking to find grammar mistakes like this all over the text....;I see it now, thanks.

I thought first that ""depth"" was an adjective of "" energy"".If every line of the Birthmark is like that, maybe I'll finish it in a couple of years, lol.;The mother of Poe was an actress. She was ""killed"" hundreds, perhaps thousands of times during the plays. And Poe, just a kid, was always a member of the audience.For a child, to see your mother dying, and coming back to life over and over....I guess it's not very educational or constructive. Tis maight be the root couse of Poe's obsession with death.This idea is not mine, of course, I read it in his biography.PS, not to mention the fact that every single woman he loved had a painful, premature death, for example his stepmother, his cousin-wife, etc.;Poe was a man of action and passion  and men of action do stuff. Yes, many of his characters are crazy and have intense, long monologues....but sooner or later they get moving, and they don  t ask why, they ask how.Look for example the  Cask of Amontillado. The  Montresor   says "" Fortunato   has offended me""....and that is enough for him to go and do what he did.  The reader doesnt have a clue of  what type of offence  Fortunato did in order to deserve that ending....it's just the actions,  what matter in Poes stories.  ;saylor.orgMismo nivel que coursera, pero sin fechas ni essays.;I got a Scandal in Bohemia   and a couple of The Monkey's Paw.My flabber was never so gasted!;I said I got a Scandal in Bohemia, and a couple of Monkey's Paw, but I didn  t say where....

In the   90s  series Friends, one of the characters was all the time justifiying his mistakes, quirkiness   on the gounds that his parents were divorced. Children of divorced parents tend to have their heads messed up. And he used  to say it    in such a comical way, that the sentence became popular, and many people say it nowadays.;It's not my own joke...anyone can use it, there's no copyright for jokes.You are just a Friends hater.....probably a Seinfield supporter.;I noticed that coursera is very visual. Not only the   courses themselves, but the way the whole system is designed, with lots of pictures, and colors, it's like being in a university theme park.You got the names of the courses, they tend to be very flashy, like ""Know Thyself"", ""How Things Work"", ""Gamification"" etc.Some courses have readings and activities, but most of the weight of the course is on the lectures. Some professors make videos really amazing, in different places, with spectacular backgrounds.And of course the boards, lots of stuff going on, trolling, flirting, some guys playing   know-it-alls, others complaining about peer review, some smart people making some smart comments, etc. Lots of action.And since the whole thing  works with   dates and deadlines there's a feeing of ""here and now"" very interesting.Meanwhile, other platforms of MOOCS, like saylor.org are less visual. They combine lectures from several universities, with lots of readings, but no peer assigments, and no deadlines, it's self paced, and there's barely no action in the f _rums.And the names of the courses follow a strict university terminology ""Intro math 101"", ""intro math 102"", ""intro math 103"", etc, it's all much more ""low profile"" than coursera, but   it's more similar to a real university semester course.So in other words: coursera is more visual, fun, exciting, (but you don  t learn  so much because you just enjoy the whole thing)   meanwhile saylor is more academic, boring, hard, (and you learn more at the end of the course, because there's less distractions )So I guess for a guy like me, with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder with no Hyperactivity) Saylor is the right  place   to study, and Coursera is better to take it in a more relaxed way, just watch the lectures, and have some fun.I wonder what people with ADD think about it. Can you really force yourself to work hard on a Coursera course? The only one I really made some effort on was in Introduction to Psychology by professor Smith, but the only reason was the OLI textbook that kept me focused on the subject...had not been for the OLI, I wouldnt have earned the certificate, I don  t feel motivated unless there's text , exercises with inmediate feedback, and strict, uniform  guidelines and rules. A more creative, open environtment like Coursera makes it harder to focus on the study.What do you think guys? Wanna share some thoughts on the subject?;"

I am doing English Literature   and Real World Math courses.;IF DEATH COULD WRITE.  Edgar Allan Poe was a child when he saw his mother perform Juliet  on stage. She died every single night, and we can only speculate what effect it had on young Edgar. But she entered the realm of death just a short while after, and Edgar realised that fiction and reality interact in random, chaotic ways.  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB when he was a teenager; his beloved Annabel ( who was also his cousin) also did. And even his own death was surrounded in fog, since it was not clear the cause. Some people claimed he was assaulted by criminals, other say he died after   several days on an alcohol binge, and there's even one version that said he was  forced by thugs to vote many times for a politician on voting day.  It's no surprising, then, that death plays such an important and pervading role in his writing. In my opinion, it was the way he had to  fight   the ghosts of so many loved ones gone. Anyone else, in similar circumstances, would have succumbed to so much horror; but he turned it into art.  He imitated   the random, unexpected way death knocks at the door. Death makes no sense, therefore the character in the Tell-Tale Heart seems to lack any sort of   reason to kill the old man. He hated his eye, as he could have hated a pimple   on his nose, or a gap on his teeth.A similar fashion is to be found in The Black Cat. Millions of people suffer alcoholism but they dont kill their wives  or torture their cats. The protagonist does. He does  follow the same logic that death seems to follow: everybody must pay a prize to be alive.  Poe wrote the stories that death herself would write if she could write.FORMpeer 1     The essay is well structured and easily read, attributing to its form. There aren't any significant grammar mistakes and major ideas are presented logically and in an orderly fashion.peer 2     The form is decent and I am marking you as meeting the standards. There are many opportunities for improvement. First, the thesis is not clear and I take it to be, ""He imitated  the random, unexpected way death knocks at the door."" This was toward the end of the essay, which left very little room for argument. Also, there are few small grammatical throughout. (e.g. ""It's no surprising"").peer 3     the overall form, structure and grammar, of the essay was good. the exposition of your argument was a little long but developed.peer 4     I did love that you added a creative ""title"" to your essay. Not many do it here, I don't know why. Your ideas are well- presented, so I don't have too much to say about form.peer 5     Easy to read, smooth grammar and style, well structured.CONTENTpeer 1     The content of the essay is interesting and provides the reader with some intriguing insights into the essence of the stories. Distinct concepts and arguments are divided and presented adequately and convincingly.peer 2     The content enriched my reading. I was familiar with most of Poe's biography that you listed, but I do think it is a key aspect in understanding why he wrote so much on the subject of death. Like my comments in form, I think you would have improved by reducing the biography, moving the thesis toward the beginning of the essay, and elaborated more deeply on how Poe used the subject of death in his writing.peer 3     Great argument, but needed more space i think for overall development.peer 4     I have one big issue with your argument. I think you gave too much space to the life of Poe. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't think that relying too much on an author's life is unnecessary. peer 5     Thanks for new information and interesting ideas.TOTAL SCORE: 4;Thanks, Efthymia.

Sorry for such a short review, I think it was late at night and I was a bit tired. Okay, let me add some comments now. People has been obsessing about things since the very start of humankind, we didn  t start obsessing about things in 1905 just when Freud came with his theory on fixation. I am not an expert on Freud, but didn  t he talk about ""oral fixation"" for people who were not properly breasfed as babies (so they became needy and fragile as adults) and anal retentive fixation for babies who did not play with their faeces, (so they became control freaks when they became adults). I am not sure of either Poe or Hawthorne could fall into that category.And wasnt   called ""id"" instead of ""it"" the cause of our instics and animal desires, and formed the whole mind, along with the Ego and Superego?Anyways, a great essay....just fixalitious.;Just a 3??? This eassy is original, creative and fresh, what a bunch of anal retentive reviewers.;Hola Florencia. As Laurie pointed out, lose and loose are different verbs, that's the main spelling mistake I got.Your thesis about the objectifization of women, and the economy used in the works is original and interesting,Hawthorne: subtracts, and loses his wife. Final score, -1.Poe: adds, loses his wife, gains a portrait. Final score, 0But I am not really sure they deliverately objectified their wifes....I think they got temporary insanity and the result was the death of their wives, and that causes them great pain, and proably spent the rest of their days regretting their foolish mistake,;I always title my essays. I think it makes the whole thing more clear and nice. If you start reading something with no title it seems like you are starting eating lunch by the main course...a title is an apetizer, it takes you by the hand and leads to you the essay, in a gentle way.Look for example  the title for  my last assigment: ""  If Death Could Write"". How suggestive, how many nuances, how many thoughts conveyed by 4 simple words. I should not say it, but I am a genius.;What about pre-coital games? Don  t tell me aint much better go slow, stopping here and there, so you go heating up the oven in a progressive way.;In two famous works , namely the novel The Day of the Triffids, by John Wyndham and Blindness, (film adaptation of a Jos   Saramago novel) there's several scenes of rape (in The Day of the Triddisds is very tuned down, just suggested, in Blindness is more graphic). Both scenarios depict a world where most of the population becomes blind.  The few remaining   men who can see, have a limitless source of  sex, since most women are blind and become mere toys at their hands.This is a negative forecast of what could happen if something like this happened in real life, on a massive scale.A similar negative view could be the Lord of the Flies by William Goldwin    , which was a response to the positive Coral Island, where a bunch of kids stranded on a deserted island help each other and cooperate til rescue comes.William Goldwin thought this positive view was utopic, and real life is predatory and unforgiving, and when things go tough, only the most cruel, reptilian type of people   survive.In The Land of he Blind by HG Wells there was no rape...but the guy certainly tried to take advantage of the situation, and sooner or later some sort of tradegy would unfold.So guys, what you think, we live in a potencial Coral Island, or in a Lord of the Fies society?;I forgot to include The Invisible Man, What do you think most people would do if they were invisible?;""you might find Kraken Wakes a bit annoyingly British at the beginning - it is quite terribly tiffin and tea - also a very good book though - us Brits do excel at end-of-the-world stuff ;p.

Yes, I agree that life is a roulette, inpredictable, and you can find both the best and worse at walking distance, I guess it's just a matter of attitude, the bottle can look half full or empty depending on each ones mindset.I am gonna add The Kraken Wakes and The Chrysalids to my agenda, I was a teenager when I read The Day of the Triffids, I guess reading it again wont hurt.;Interesting, John.

Folk magic practices are as telling as fairy tales and boy are Grimm's full of them.  ;That's pretty cool - thanks for sharing. :);Faith, I know what you mean, I went from living in an area that had 8 comic shops within the two cities to my nearest comic shop being almost 2 hours away when I moved from Virginia Beach, Va to Red Cliff, Wi last year. Aside for waiting for the graphic novels and ordering online, getting them digitally through comixology is the way to go. They also have apps for Apple and Android devices. All of the known publishers and a few unknowns as well have most or all of their titles available for purchase and digital download. ;Faith,You should definitely get back into them. The plots have gotten so interesting and draw from a number of historical literature sources.  The comic book stores around here have all closed as well. It's very sad. I am thankful for the Internet though, so I can purchase my favorites online. I have been getting rid of many of my single issue comics lately and buying the graphic novel collections. They are much more durable and I can put them on the shelves so I can actually see them.  ;Thanks for sharing, they sound interesting! I just placed the first 2 issues on hold at the library, even though I probably shouldn't be adding to my reading list right now :)  ;I would think Utopian is most certainly fantasy, as it is in itself a dream or a vision or aspiration for something better. I touched on utopia/dystopia briefly in uni and really enjoyed the concepts. One of my favourite movies; A Clockwork Orange looks at the concept of Dystopia well. To be honest I cant remember the titles of the other texts we read, will have to dig them up from the back of my bookshelf! But Im always open to new titles to check out ;Now that I am in my fifties and I have a teenage son, I love YA dystopia. In my younger years I read everything that came along the best seller list. I read everything that was labeled ""classic."" I gorged on Stephen King horror books, and I had a Harlequin romance subscription! Yes, don't laugh...I received a free wine glass with every book. Finally, I found my true loves: John Steinbeck, Native American authors, and creative nonfiction. But science fiction, especially wild dystopias, hold a spell over me. They are titillating because they just might come true. They weave in the possible with the impossible in such a spellbinding morbid way. As in the Hunger Games, we visit isolated communities based on a class system with people raised to perform certain hideous tasks. It is reminiscent of our society today: theme schools for the poor, isolated neighborhoods without services, wild packs of dogs attacking pedestrians, and health care for the rich. Dystopias are like a scream for help, and they captivate us with their injustice. Maybe they are not shelved in the library with science fiction, but they certainly contain the concepts.;Me three.;I've not read or seen The Hunger Games (though I did read a brilliant essay on how the series, and other novels, reinforce false ideas about violence and trauma on combat veteran-turned-peace activist Paul K Chappell's website). People I know who've done so all enjoyed the books, but seemed fairly evenly split about the films.;I really enjoy Dystopian novels. Thanks for the recommendations in this thread! I have always considered Dystopian stories as fantasy because often the author identifies a main flaw in society and imagines what our world could become because of this flaw. For instance, The Giver is a very simple yet powerful Dystopian story. Many freedoms are taken from the people in order to keep them ignorant and controlled, yet they are taken care of. In our modern day society, people still struggle between finding the right balance between liberties and safety. If you are interested in Dystopian literature, this is truly a great novel to pick up.;Faith,There is also a fourth book now to finish out the quartet (""Son"") if you haven't read it. I found it to be a really great finish to what was already a great series by Lowry.;The concepts of Utopia/Dystopia seem to arise from the possibilities of future developments. We've always known as a species that technology could be our savior, or our downfall; and so it's interesting to explore both possibilities. As in most things I say, I'll reference Philip K. Dick as both the exception and the rule. In most of his more popular writings, he explored the dystopian repercussions of technologies that had already come and gone (which also side-steps the over explaining problem); and in some, he simply represented a surprisingly mundane world that happened to have odd technologies.;Going through my copy against the ones we're supposed to read I noticed I am missing a number of them. I have the B&N version with Introduction and Notes by Elizabeth Dalton.  One thing that was a bit weird was that this link lists it as Clever Else and my book lists it as Clever Alice. They're the same story, I checked. Is that just a translation thing? I also noticed that it's not Gretel in either version, it's Grethel. Hansel and Grethel as well as Clever Grethel. Is that another German translation thing? I know absolutely nothing about German, so anyone who knows, care to pipe up?;Thanks for the heads up.

I am an incredibly slow learner.As a kid, if the language was a bit beyond me, that was simple: Dictionary. But if the concepts were too far beyond me or made me uncomfy, the book was ditched quite quickly. I think I genuinely didn't get the Heinlein sex stuff as a youngster, so mentally shunted it aside, tore through the book and went on to the next. It wasn't until I went back years later that I was surprised. Perhaps each kid just takes from books what they can.  Mind you, I do remember as a pre-teen being very confused by the phrase ""the friendship of her thighs"" in my collection of Irish myths, and even more bewildered by my parents' reaction to my asking about it.  ;Yes, thank you for the essay.   In general, I think he makes good points.   In the specifics, however, I have quibbles over a couple of details.1) Women in combat. Previous generations of anthropologists automatically assumed that battle-graves held men, without bothering to check the pelvis for gender.   Americans have likely heard of Molly Pitcher.   Disney's Mulan is based upon a legendary Chinese figure.   Korea's Royal Court included women guards, who fought with fan and throwing knives.   Kathleen Hurley wrote a blog post, ""We have always fought: Challenging the Women, Cattle, and Slaves Narrative"" just last month, I recommend reading it.2) I can think of one movie that does include a character messing their pants in combat.   The ""Karate Kid"" remake (I call it ""Kung Fu Kid,"" since that's what this kid learns) with Will Smith's son, the brown at his pants was very clear in movie theaters, when the bullies gang up on him.;I am not quite sure honestly. I do love The Red Shoes though, not going to lie. Also, the movie. That movie is amazingly beautiful.  I tried to do some searching and I didn't come up with anything. I think I may dig deeper when I have the time. I'm curious now.;I wondered how I didn't have Cinderella in my book. I have heard that name for it, but not for a long time.  ;Do you mean the movie with Brandy in it from 1997?But really, is there one?;Ohhh. Cool! Thank you. :);Cinderella was always my favorite. I don't know why but I guess it had to do with the evil assholes, I mean, step-family finally getting theirs.  ;It's ok. I started singing Cinderella, Cinderella night and day it's Cinderella. It also doesn't help that I was in a production of it either.  ;I chime in for Neil Gaiman as well. I don't know if you watch Doctor Who or not but it's steered into the path of being fairy tale like. Especially Gaiman's episode, The Doctor's Wife. Stardust, of his, is also a fantastic fairy tale. I don't think it will ever really fade. There's always going to be an undercurrent of it.  ;Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Maiden, Mother and Crone. Goldy Locks and The 3 Bears.3 pops up in pretty much ever religion around the world, in some form or another.  People also tap out beats to start dance numbers or to be in sync with each other.  Third time's the charm. It's in sports and geography and music and almost anything you can think of. I don't know why but it's really interesting.  ;Numerology is an interesting beast.  ;To me it seems like abstract morals. Or doing 'bad' things for a good purpose. I'm not sure about what version you are reading but I've noticed that some things are more prominent in certain translations and absent in others. And these are tales of a different time and morals were different, people and the world were viewed different and some things that are important to us now, weren't then.  ;Well, a long time ago if a child disobeyed ,and by a long time I mean BCE, they were stoned to death. Children did what they were told and nothing more. You learned what you had to to be an obedient, productive member of society. Population was low. Disease was high and they needed everyone to follow orders. Also, people didn't have all of the understanding about our world. To them, the thunder really was caused by an angry God. So, that was to be feared above all else and sometimes the only way to instill that was violently.  ;Honestly, I read these versions of the fairy tales before I ever saw the Disney or ""happy"" versions of them. I wasn't really phased by it.  ;Oh, ok. I get what you're saying.  I think there is a moral to the story, it's just not so obvious and it's hidden in riddles and symbols. Some aren't apparent to us because of the time period. That's just how I view it.  ;This.  Very true. My french teacher in high school talked to us about that when we studied Beauty and The Beast, as it's a French fairy tale.  ;I started trying to read, by myself, at around 2 years old. I would attempt to read everything, cereal boxes, shampoo bottles, the milk jug. My grandma realized that and got me materials that would teach me and I've been reading ever since.She did read to me and she would always make up a story to put me to sleep at night. It always involved me and I was a great adventurer and I defeated all of the bad people and saved the day. I loved those stories, they sparked my imagination and made me believe I could do anything. I guess it really stayed with me. I don't think that all children are drawn to stories or reading. My sister is the exact opposite, despite our early attempts to get her to read. She still has no interest in it. She didn't like bedtime stories and preferred to draw in the books I gave her. I guess it just didn't spark her imagination. With all of my cousins, who are like brothers and sisters, I watched the scenario play out. Some love it and some don't, despite the same household and the love of reading around them. Really interesting. Not everyone is geared towards words.;I can totally see that. I love Alice and anything that spins off. Definitely one of my favorite stories. But I always saw the Doctor as more of a Merlin character. Yay! Whovians.  ;Having read a lot of these in my younger years, it doesn't particularly affect me. I mean, I notice it but I don't really have a problem with it. It was a different time period. I can't hate them for that. I think someone mentioned Tom Sawyer and how they use the ""N"" word. Well, when we had to read that our junior year we had to say 'man' instead of it. Which really made me mad because we are reading a piece of work from a time when that was considered ok. Do we really have to sanitize it? Coming from a mixed family, it's just a world and unless you try and put meaning behind it...it's just a word and these are just someone elses views and they're dead now. But discussing them is very interesting. Sadly though, we still see the bigotry in our modern world and some things haven't changed.  ;She really was. Anytime something controversial came up it was glossed over and explained away. It was really disheartening.  ;Who knows and we probably never will. But remember, at that time, a man of his age courting an 11 year old wasn't weird. It's weird now and we call it pedophilia but 50 year old men used to marry 9 year old girls. So, I feel like this is a moot point when reading his work. If you want to nit pick and pull out sources and say ""Yes! this man wanted to mess around with little girls"" that's fine but I think it detracts from his work. Even if he was attracted to them and it wasn't appropriate, I don't believe he ever actually did anything.  ;The same was said about J.M. Barrie because he loved Sylvia Llewelyn Davies boys.

Thanks to all peers for their replies. :)War of the WorldsStoker's Dracula is, at it's core, a story about struggle between the world of old, represented by Count Dracula, and the modern world, represented by the Harkers, Dr. Seward, Quincey Morris, and Lord Godalming, while the character of dr. Van Helsing acts as a mediator between the two since he's equally embracing old practices and the achievements of modern science.Carpathia is a land far to the east, belonging to the part of the world that is, at the time the novel was written, thought to be underdeveloped and uncivilized, and somehow exotic at the same time.It is no wonder then that Jonathan Harker, on his way to castle Dracula, observes natural beauty of dark pine woods and dangerous mountain passages, encounters wolves, superstitious gypsies, and other symbolic representations of the dark ages when the world was chaotic. While one might acknowledge the existence of such place, it is always quite remote and there's no fear it will come into contact with the civilized and ordered modernity.Once the Count decides to cross the border between the two, perceived order is quickly shaken as unfathomable things happen and modern Londoners don't know how to respond properly or what to make of the seemingly unrelated events. They're visibly alarmed but they're refusing to believe into something they can't explain logically, that is, until Van Helsing arrives and brings the means and the ancient knowledge to fight back against the otherworldly foe. With Helsing's genius that is able to merge the old with the new - mysticism with science - heroes are able to fight off the fiend that threatens to destroy their world and restore the order and conformity of the modernity once more.Form: 2peer 1     Your sentences are clear and grammatically correct, and your argument is laid out pretty clearly.peer 2     Good structure of the text with a clear introduction and conclusion.

Overall grammar was very good and words properly used.peer 3     I appreciate very much this structure, with a clear title and a fluid development. peer 4     Almost perfect. The only thing that put me off was the slightly elongated sentence structure at the beginning of the essay. peer 5     Your wording doesn't look quite natural to me.

There is a theory, sustained with strenght and I appreciate very very much his/her way to do it. It is a very original point of view and I would like to deppen this good point of reflection. Bravo!peer 4     The content was very good. The notion of old and new was very well explained and laid out with concrete examples. It was a notion that I had in my head that I couldn't quite focus on so I thoroughly enjoyed this essay which encapsulated the idea in one concise article. Thank you for a very well written and thought out essay.peer 5     I tend to like the idea of old and new world confronting, but I wouldn't say it's a ""core"" idea in Dracula... Where have you found it btw?

The details of your argument are correct -- I have found the thought on the contrast of mysticism and science to be particularly interesting -- but still, the conclusion is oversimplified.peer 4     Excellent job - I really enjoyed this.

Unfortunately, word limit prevented me from explaining it in greater detail, so I'll post the essay here and add brief comments afterwards.Monsters of our MindsFrankenstein's monster is the personification of burning ambition to fulfill some greater goal we feel to be destined for, and all the fears, doubts, and desires - the horrific apparitions conjured in our minds - that torment us and lead to destruction if we allow ourselves to leave them unchecked. This ambition, the real monster of the story, may exist only within the mind of Victor Frankenstein.  From the moment we witness Frankenstein's success in creating life - giving form to his ambition - he is constantly in refusal of the responsibility he has towards this creature, himself, and the mankind. He flees and leaves it unchecked, allowing it to creep behind the scenes of rational world and grow in secrecy, only to return to the surface and deliver doom to the ones he cares for and to himself. Soon after the agreement to fulfill creature's wants for a companion, he realizes his world would be in danger and overrun by their demonic offspring, and finding there's no easy escape, he decides to take control and extinguish the monster within himself, by chasing it all over the - metaphorical inner - world. Understanding the dangers of ambition, he warns Walton against pursuing his own goal, to leave it be and to escape his own downfall. It is no wonder then that the only other person in the story to explicitly see Frankenstein's monster is Walton himself, as the two possess the ambition, know it, and can understand one another; suddenly, the creature is manifested before his eyes - the ugly ambition that drove his friend to death, one he won't follow.""But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go"" [1] says Frankenstein, after contemplating previous encounter with the monster, and sends us subtle message that no matter how far we run, our monsters will follow for they are part of us - we gave them life and in cursing them, we curse ourselves.Works cited: [1] Shelley, M.; Frankenstein; Collins Classics, 2010; page 138, paragraph III.Grade: 2 + 2.5 = 4.5My take was that the Monster represents Frankenstein's ambition. It might not exist in the physical world as separate entity but it may manifest, in a moment of clarity, before those who have their own ambitions and are determined to pursue them no matter the cost, such as Frankenstein and Walton who are similar in many aspects yet Walton finally decides to abandon his pursuit after he sees what he might come to if he persists.  Killings mentioned in the book, from my perspective, are symbolic. If we look closer, we'll see William, Clerval, and Elizabeth are suffocated - Frankenstein's ambition is suffocating, overbearing, and he loses them to it. This might merely be a separation, not death. His father, on the other hand, might really have died in the novel, brought down by the dissolution of the family through his son's ambition.  I'm not yet sure how Justine's death may be explained with this analysis.Comments?;Monsters of our MindsFrankenstein's monster is the personification of burning ambition to fulfill some greater goal we feel to be destined for, and all the fears, doubts, and desires - the horrific apparitions conjured in our minds - that torment us and lead to destruction if we allow ourselves to leave them unchecked.

Good points. peer 3     This essay shows a deep understanding of the symbolic meaning of ambition in Shelley's masterpiece, demonstrating not only that it is a constant in the narratives, but also that it allows the reader to realize that the monster, Victor and Walton are doppelgangers.peer 4     Nice concept but I still confuse to some ideaAdditional comments:  peer 1     All in all, good work!peer 2     I really liked your essay because it gives me a deeper understanding of my own reading of the book. I think you're right in saying that the world in which Frankenstein hunts his ""monster"" is a metaphorical ""inner world"", and in more than one sense: for the monstrosity of the creature is none other than the monstrosity of Frankenstein and humanity itself - the creature only mirrors the attitudes of others towards him. Thus, the true monster of the novel - and the true warning it gives - is not against that what is inhuman - for it wasn't the creature's inhuman shape or powers that made it cruel and filled with vice. Rather, its against humans monstrosity itself, in its contradictory ambition to go beyond its own limits, while simultaneously rejecting all that is different and unknown to themselves. That's why humans are not suited to be creators, according to this reading. In other essay, the author claimed that the creature represents technology, and I also see that as a fit reading to enrich this interpretation. For man's ""creature"" is none other than technology; and it's through technology that he hopes to go beyond the limitations of his human condition and achieve dominion over life and death. However, the pride that leads him to ambition overcoming his limitations is the same pride that leads him to be selfish and prejudiced against that which is created by him, and thus enter in a conflict with its creature that leads to the destruction of both. Thus, the monster that humanity faces isn't that of what is inhuman, but it's own inner monstrosity, which is the sole responsible for whatever monstrosity its creature has. peer 4     In general it give me more view point to look the Frankenstein novel.I really appreciate peers who invested some time to write additional comments and particularly to peer 2 who decided to expand on the essay with his/ her own ideas. Peer 3's comment on Form is really flattering. :)  This grade is an improvement as previous essays were graded with 4, and even more so since I didn't manage to include everything I had in mind to support the thesis.

Searching for terms like    one   ,    two   ,    three    and so on until    twenty   , we come to discover that there are seven numbers that show up as the most used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12. The other numbers appears no more than six times.One can suppose a religious motivation behind these numbers. The number    one   , for example, could be a reference to God, the pairs could point to the divine/human duality of Christ, the triples, to the Trinity. We don't think so. Maybe these references may be true, but we think they come from the before Christ era, from ancient Greek philosophy.Most of the Grimms' tales were collected from European oral tradition, so it's valid to believe that they can have a BCE origin. Such numeric citations resemble a reference to Pythagorean and Platonic numerology. The pythagoreans had as a doctrinal central point a figure formed by piling the first four numbers to form a triangle, and triangles were also basic in Plato's cosmology. Seven and twelve can point respectively to the number of heavenly bodies known in Antiquity and the signs of zodiac. One can point that there were eight heavenly bodies, including the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, but in the Grimms' tales there is also an eighth character to complete the number, as in The Wolf and the Seven Kids or even the man that blows the seven windmills.We think the reason why this numerology is present in the tales is that ancient folks believed that exposing people to these numbers will put they under their magical influence. Not only the content of the tales would be worth of learning but the mere listening would bring good luck to the listener. Kind of an aesthetic soteriology, where being exposed to sacred symbols and rituals can bring salvation.Works cited:  The central point defended in my essay comes from Metaphysics classes I've taken from Prof. Glenn W.

Next time around try to leave out the stuff that is obvious and the stuff you are not going to use (Christian numerology, which really was just a strategy to include pre-Christian beliefs into christianity in Order to gain power) but explain your thesis better by giving examples. Be concrete.peer 3      There are some grammatical inconsistencies, such as spelling a number at one point (""twelve"") and not at another point (""12""). The argument does proceed logically, though, and in a way that makes sense.peer 4      Great elucidation of surprisingly profound ideas which manage to avoid both simplicity and difficult argot. It is a pity that there is such a stringent word limit as you obviously have more to contribute regarding this topic, and you leave the reader wanting more. That said, your form could be slightly more fleshed out. In terms of redaction, you are good but would definitely profit from some practice. For example, sentences like this one should be completely revised: ""Not only the content of the tales would be worth of learning but the mere listening would bring good luck to the listener."" As you can see, there is a slight misuse of words and it is somewhat redundant.Overall evaluation (CONTENT) - Grade 2peer 1      I like how deep you analyzed this theme. I also noticed the huge usage of the numbers in Brothers Grimms' fairytale but always thought about them in the context of christian religion.

However, I think that the writer reached a little far, attempting to argue too much within the confines of space. As such, the essay seems to only just skim over ideas rather than exploring them in depth.peer 4      Your content definitely merits a perfect score despite the fact that, unfortunately, you obviously did not have enough space to flesh out your ideas with as much thoroughness as you desired and which your essay definitely deserved. It was a pleasant surprise to see useful references to numerology and metaphysical issues without witnessing a diversion from this unit's theme, and that doubtlessly merits recognition.

Regardless, I remembered this other tale called Hans in Luck, in which the main character Hans is a servant and described as being a person of much luck.What I found in common between this tale and the one you mentioned, is that luck is an attribute that makes the character different from all the rest and that will help them succeed in the story (although in Hans case it seems like an ironic kind of Luck), almost like a skill. When it comes to princes and king's sons, on the other hand, they are never described as being lucky, it is just implicit in the story. If the hero of the tale is a prince you know things will be okay just because he showed up. Even when the prince is put in danger, something will happen that will lead him to a happy ending. On the other hand, if the hero is a low born, be him lucky, smart, strong... you will have to keep reading to know what he will do to overcome his difficulties.In the end, I think the big difference is when the hero is high born you'll learn what happened to him, while when the hero is low born you'll learn what he had to do.Does this sound coherent at all?  ;Hi Theo, I appreciate your response, and I do see what you say, but fantasy in general provides that escape from the known usual, and yet deviating this much from causality is not at all accepted in other fantasy sub-genres. And besides, Grimm tales are far from safe haven, at least for my taste. Some of them, like the Death of the Hen, or the youth who went to learn about fear, make the horror genre shy. And still I can't put them down. I think what Rebecca said is definitely part of it, and what you say is part of it. But I fancy, there must be more.Thanks;"

In the nineteenth century, women were seen through a cloud of stereotypes. In his novel    Dracula    Bram Stoker portrays women as social, subservient to men, and unable to resist the temptations of men.  In Lucy Westerna   s letter to Mina Harker, she talks about how she and Mina have    told all our secrets to each other since we were children    (Pg. 52) and    eaten together, and laughed and cried together    (Pg. 52). Women are shown as social beings that thrive on social interaction. In Dracula   s castle, there are three female vampires who live with Dracula. These women represent the subservience of women toward men:   they are the servants of Count Dracula, kept forever in the darkness of his castle. Dracula   s ability to change his victims into slaves is another allusion to the subservience of women; all of his victims are women.   Finally, women are portrayed as unable to resist the temptations of men.   In the castle, as Dracula is defending Jonathan Harker from three vampire women, he is accused of being unable to love, to which he responds    Yes I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past    (Pg. 37), which shows that he was able to tempt them into being vampires by making love to them. When Mina and Van Helsing are in the forest, the vampire women call to Mina, asking her to join them. Stoker makes a point to show that if Van Helsing had not been there, Mina would have succumbed to temptation, and would have ended as a vampire herself.   In conclusion, Stoker gave the women in his novel these traits in order to craft them into perfect victims for a sexual predator like Dracula. He made them dependent so that they would need a man in their life, subservient so that they would obey Dracula when he caught them, and unable to resist temptation so that Dracula could easily catch them.   ;Ratka, I'm really sorry you feel this way.

More of than than not, these stories act as sugar-coats for a moral lesson, and has motifs that most people telling them don't think too much about.As for fairy-tales evolving and/or surviving, they have evolved as movies and modern fantasies are very similar to fairy-tales. The question here is, is the traditional ""wisdom"" that is supposed to be there behind every fairytale still present in the modern ones? Are modern fairytales still stories we can tell children without any fear that they'll be horrified or disturbed when wolf eats up grandmother?;I quite agree with what you say about homemade fairy tales; in my part of the world, children and adults likewise have a whole horde of fairy tales and fantasy sagas that are actually instilled in them- our bed-time stories always involve Indian folktales and hardly ever Snow White. In fact i vaguely remember hardly being able to relate to these when i was a child encountering the Grimm brothers for the first time. Fairy tales do have to have some connection to the present society. Of course, movies are a whole new world of fairy tales, ET, Lion King, Narnia..there is happily no end to them, and they continue being made all the time.

Let me take this opportunity   to thanks my reviewers, and here goes my essay along with my peer's comment: (*be kind!*)Tracing Spirituality, Religion, and Myth in Grimms    Tales(With special reference to  Hansel and Grethel,  Little Red Cap and Little Thorn Rose  or  Sleeping Beauty)The Grimms brothers collected and wrote down folktales that had a distinctive German flavour. However, the well-read and religious Whilhelm who fleshed out most of the Grimms    fairy tales, included much of his own faith (Christianity), nationalistic feelings (Old Norse and German myths), and education (Roman and Greek myth) within the stories.In  Little Red Cap  for instance, the girl is given bread and wine to take to her grandmother, which is distinctively Eucharist and is meant to revitalize. This is very different from Charles Perrault   s version where it   s just bread and butter. The red cap signifies sexual maturity but it is also the colour of Pentecost, and so later the child learns that if she goes    off the path    she will    fall.      The wolf encounter is the child   s test of faith and resolve. She tells the wolf that grandmother lives in a house    under three great oak trees...    The oak, in Germanic mythology is sacramental since it is a place of sacrifice to the god Woden. To this, Grimms added the triune God of Christianity.The frog in  Sleeping Beauty  that emerges from water (signifying both Christian rebirth and pagan    time flow   ) is an amphibious    double natured    being and hence magical. Like the white duck in  Hansel and Grethel, the frog can comfortably cross the boundaries between two worlds, and helps people to do the same (water and land).The Christian motif of rebirth is seen time and time again through the works of the Grimm brothers. At the beginning of  Sleeping Beauty,    the queen was seated bathing  _      where the Grimms associate    bath,    with baptism     a rebirth that according to them not only washes away ones sins but also removes its mortal consequence. This motif recurs in  Hansel and Grethel  when they are required to cross the river.Such mythical, religious, and even psychological symbols woven intricately in Grimms    fairy tales vouch for their enduring appeal through the centuries.

As for the peer comments on the form, I copy pasted them with my essay too     do you see them?   Anon, thanks for your valuable, anonymous (and hence meaningful and unanimous?) instruction on Internet etiquette. My off-line life necessitates me to sleep if it   s past 3 am in the morning, and I think that   s what I will stick to, even if   hurts a few people   s fragile sentiments.  ;Thank you, Anon. I agree the peer review process frustrates a lot of us, but I guess as Emma Fry pointed out in another thread, it   s best to gracefully accept and learn from the comments we agree with and completely disregard the ones that we vehemently oppose. Considering we have to go through this process 10 times in the coming weeks, I believe that   s the best course of action for our peace of mind as well as our learning curve!  Coming back to your essay, I quite like the parallels you drew with the kings of yore. Indeed it   s widely accepted today that the brothers did not create the materials of their work, but rather collected them. Prof. Rabkin mentions this quite extensively in one of the lectures including how Wilhelm wove in his nationalist sentiments into the fabric of his fairy tales.   In The Frog Prince, we can also draw connections with the Greek story of Atlanta and the golden apples (Prof. Rabkin   s lecture). Personally, I also thought of the golden ball of thread Ariadne gives to Theseus so that he can defeat the Minotaur     representing the other spectrum where the ball instead of reflecting sexual maturity goes on to become a symbol of revealing the way (of knowledge).   Finally, like the others above, I quite like your essay. Thanks for sharing.;By the time I came to    So it came to be that the big princess (really???)   were having an unwanted child...    I was cracking up so hard that I almost spilled my coffee over the laptop! I am really afraid I would end up giving you very high score just because you dared to do this. I love it!  Actually in a twisted way your essay does enrich one   s reading of the stories     the commentary on society, the twisted sense of justice seen in the Grimms    stories are all there in your, umm.. essay (?);Ah, there you go Joseph! Now you have both Sharon and me to give you a good grade next time! Here's to hoping the system is kind.;Good to know you are in the other course too.

By exploring the importance of written and said words in what is essentially a reinvention of word-of-the-mouth stories, your essay hinges on a very important facet about this week   s reading. As for the form, I can   t agree with your peers     you use a good structure (the tab before your paragraphs is actually the right way of writing an academic essay that I did not follow. Peer 2   s comment,      If ""it shouldn   t surprise us much"", when why bother. Why write an essay on the obvious (sic)?    seems pointless, honestly and seems to completely miss the point that it   s a style of writing rather than a commentary on the fact that all readers will make this connection between the importance of words and the fairy tales.   Also, I believe you did a good job by choosing to discuss the    underground    tales as my peer commented.  ;Daniel, this is a very good essay. You seem to have received good peer comments on your essay as well. Congratulations on a work very well done.  ;Anthony, I understand what you mean when you say you did not have a lot of time to prepare for your essay. I audited this course last time around and I remember I joined in Week 2 and I was meant to write the essay on Unit 2. Believe it or not, I had ten minutes left on the countdown before submission     I kid you not!  And because I thought I would fight through the course, I wrote an essay in 8 mins and clicked submit. I got a 4.5!! I think I was just plain lucky. Of course I could not keep up with the course last time around due to various personal reasons, but the point is, you can do a good enough job even if you are in a hurry.   Coming to your essay, the first thing that I noticed when I saw your essay was that you got really long peer feedback, which is a good thing. You have a very good opening line, but as a peer comments, your opening line and your exposition about how words    serve to bookmark and separate the story's different stages    are slightly at odds. Indeed I am pointing this out because I think you have a really strong theme to your essay and you have chosen very apt examples to elucidate your points     a few alternations here and there could make this an excellent essay (which I think you would have anyway done if you had more time to review). Overall, I would give you a 4.5 or 5 and definitely not a 4. Thanks for sharing!;Claire, it's great to see familiar people in this course. (We are in Prof. Peter's class too). I follow your blog because I quite like your style of writing, the extra images/information that you include there and this essay of yours was no different. I enjoyed reading it! Like one of your peers mentioned, I did not notice how often the symbol of feet and shoes have been used in the story, and indeed it's interesting how it's so important for the price to find the right 'fit.'  ;Just a quick note to others in the course: People, please share your thoughts on the essays posted here. Unlike the other courses I have participated before, this time around we do not have a lot of people participating in this discussion. The last time around I audited the course, there were a huge number of people discussing each of the essays - it really helps to widen one's ideas.  ;Johsua and Masako, I am afraid it does seem tedious to read the books now, but as Daniel and Anthony puts it, give it another go with an open mind. Even better, I guess you should read up a bit on the works before you go back to the books - check out the various interpretations of the work and what it really means.I know a girl who has a tattoo of the Cheshire Cat on her. I mean come on! Surely the book means  something  if it affects people so much?

Thanks a ton!!Frankenstein   s    Monster   : A Product of Nurture, Not Nature           Psychologists and literary scholars alike have cried themselves hoarse through the years over the question of nature versus nurture affecting human actions. What is it that makes one commit crimes? Is his brain really    abnormal    as the 1931 film  Frankenstein  would have us believe (1) or is he merely a product of his society   s atrocities (2)?           If we are cued onto the subtle signs in Shelley   s novel, we realize that the character of Victor Frankenstein   s Creature serves to answer this debate. Shelley defies the moral sense of monstrosity that was prevalent in the Renaissance literature (3) and uses the same idea of    monster    to show how the society was responsible for making him the    fiend    he eventually became.           At the beginning, the Creature tries to fit into the society where he finds himself abandoned. Yet, he meets with only disgust, fear, and hatred because of his    unearthly...ugliness    (P153) (4). Finally, after months of nurturing love for the DeLacy family and silently acting as their    good spirit,    the Creature gathers up the courage to earn    happiness...forever.       Do not you desert me...    (P91) he  beseeches   the old man, but is hit again.         Shunned by his own creator and later by these    protectors,    the Creature is left with a raging abhorrence for all of society. Yet, he does not enjoy killing (5). Murdering is a    deadly torture    for him, flamed by his    bitter indignation    and    insatiable thirst for vengeance    at being repeatedly failed.           While this does not absolve him of all crimes, we realize that the Creature, who is not even afforded a name, has been deserted from the moment of creation. From this betrayal emanates his anger. Lack of understanding, tutelage, and love created the    Monster    who was merely a hideous Creature with potential before.         Thus while the Prometheus of yore brought fire to mankind and helped them, Frankenstein, the    Modern Prometheus    did nothing to help his creation or mankind. And so in the    torturing flames    of fire ends the life of the misunderstood and mistreated Creature.  Works cited:Shelly, Mary.  Frankenstein. Ed:Paul Hunter. Norton Critical Edition.

Essay layout is very logical and easy to follow, with the arguments and explanations falling easily into place. There is no a word wasted in this essay.peer 2      The question of the role of nature or nurture in the creature's evolution into a monster is interesting. Great idea for an essay. For the most part, the grammar is proficient and the vocabulary effective. A couple of things I thought I would point out: 1. This sentence actually doesn't make sense. It's missing a word or two, I think: ""over the question of nature versus nurture affecting human actions."" 2. In the sentence ""Is his brain really    abnormal   "" you use what I call a vague pronoun. It's not clear who you mean by ""his."" When you use pronouns, be sure it's clear to the reader who or what the pronoun refers to. 3. You use the word ""besieges"" when I think you mean ""beseeches."" 4. ""at being repeatedly failed"" is unclear. Again, it seems incomplete. Overall, though, the writing is clear and effective. With some simple editing, it could be clearer.peer 3      Well written.

I have read a few essays by you in the discussion threads, and I believe your style is consistently improving with each essay - at this rate, you would be rocking by Week 10!  Some of the sentence structures are slightly uncomfortable, but nothing that a revision cannot correct. For example:  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB when he was a teenager; his beloved Annabel ( who was also his cousin) also did. And even his own death was surrounded in fog, since it was not clear the cause  could be written as  Death was always a steady companion in Poe's life. His step mother died of TB (maybe in literature it's better to write  tuberculosis)when he was a teenager. He also lost his  beloved and  cousin,  Annabel. His own death too  was  surrounded in fog a fog of mystery.  (You should have written ""since the cause was not clear""  however since in the next sentence you go on to hash out the various theories surrounding his death, that sentence is self-evident)Now those are just my opinion. Overall, a very good attempt. Thanks for sharing and starting the thread.;Sean, some male authors and graphic novel writers saying Death is a woman does not make it true! Uh... I dunno why I am arguing over this! The fact is, the more I think about this, the more I like the idea of Death being her. More power to us.In Hindu mythology Kali is sort of the goddess of Death and Destruction. But so is his consort Shiva (male). Again they come together as ardhyanariswer,  which basically means half-man and half-woman and becomes one. Evidently the Greeks having a male god in Hades makes the whole thing more confusing. I think I will just stick with Rowling's soul-less Dementors with no confusing sex.Btw, the William Hartnell reference was so lost on me. :|;Please don't apologize, Sean!    I  am sorry if my comment seemed like I took offense! I took it absolutely lightly. In fact, like I said,   it would be fun if Death is supposed to be a woman. But then, that's just if we think of Death philosophically or in a literary way. In reality, no matter  who or what  death is, it's just painful - be it death of animals, family, or a homeless person.Oh and I think it's unfair on the third gender if we leave them out as a part of the discussion. I believe that's why   we have the hermaphrodite  deity in Hindu mythology. I agree with you when you say gods are quite gender-fluid in a way. Interesting thought about Ganesha. Not sure if he is the god of science (though I cannot boast I know all about the myths of the East). He is however, the original scribe and it is said that he wrote the whole of  Mahabharata  at one go, with Vsaya   (the real author) dictating it to him. Umm... I am sorry if that's too much information! Myth always excites me. I had a huge Greek and Roman mythology phase when I was in school, and a Chinese and Celtic phase when I was in College. :DBtw, I was definitely not slighting  Sandman. How can I?

Look forward to your comments.__________Women in Refrigerators Syndrome in Hawthorne   s WorkThe term    Women in Refrigerators    was coined by Gail Simone, an American comic book writer (1) who noticed how too many women in the comic world are randomly killed off by the author to further the plot. Most often than not, in these comics, the woman is the love interest of the hero and when the villain kills the woman, it helps the revenge motif plays out. The women thus become playthings in the hands of the author and protagonist     a plot mechanism that has been severely censured by feminist critics.Hawthorne   s men of science in    The Birthmark,       Rappaccini   s Daughter,    and    Dr. Heidegger   s Experiment,    each have a woman in the background. In a slight twist to the pop cultural Women in Refrigerators syndrome, the hero here is also the villain and their women are killed off to satisfy their own medieval alchemist-like urges.Dr. Heidegger   s lady    swallowed one of her lover   s prescriptions and died,    triggering off his somewhat dark career filled with stories of sorcery. Though not explicitly mentioned, the woman dies because of Heidegger and this makes him a lonely, obsessed, and cruel man. Indeed his experiment on his friends was hurtful and emotionally damaging to them. One can imagine that the similarly obsessed Aylmer who in spite of knowing his failures proceeded to remove Georgiana   s birthmark will eventually transform into another Dr. Heidegger     a bitter, old, twisted, and cunning man with no regard for human life and friends.  Rappaccini   s daughter too is simply a tool to be manipulated by his father and later her Italian lover and Signor Baglioni, her father   s rival.In all these three stories, the women have no role other than playing the morally upright and sacrificial maidens who are then metaphorically stuffed in the refrigerator so that the experiments, rivalries, and stories of the men can be played out.Bibliography(1)     Women in Refrigerators (or WiR) is a website that was created in 1999 by a group of comic book fans. The website features a list of female comic book characters that had been injured, killed, or depowered as a plot device within various superhero comic books. Also, the site seeks to analyze why these plot devices are used disproportionately on female characters.WiR also sparked discussion outside of comic book fandom. In 2000, several national newspapers ran articles that referenced the site. The articles about WiR generated discussion on the topic of sexism in pop culture and the comic book industry. This website is cited by a number of Universities while discussing gender perception in literature.  Note by self: In this essay I have tried to discuss how this sexist phenomenon in popular literature was also used as a plot device by the writers of yore.Main Text:Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

Thank youpeer 3      Interesting content that made me think about the role of women in this type of literature.peer 4      The lover in the story of Rappaccini's daughter is Italian not Spanish. However that does not detract from the argument about the comparison of the woman in the refrigerator theory. Yet these stories are from a time when women were still subjegated by men and viewed as possessions and not equals. I do see the similarity between this and the comic strip technique but I think a bit more discussion of the history might have strengthed this piece.  ;Yay! I am so excited to at last ""meet"" one of my peers! No one ever popped in to say hi before when I posted my peer's comments here. Thanks so much for your feedback and insights, James.  Thanks for the link, Greg!  It wasn   t going to be    Cobalt Blue.    It was going to be    Sapphire Blue.    In other words, it was going to be a woman.Indeed, that's always the point. I was quite enthralled by this phenomena in comic books, and I soon realized this is too true of many many authors - and it's just not fair!  Looks like apart from reading and writing good poetry, you enjoy graphic novels too!;Greg, you are correct. However, if you read on what Gail Simone has to say about this a bit further, you will notice she tries to get the graphic novel writers explain  why  this phenomena is important. Also, while the revenge motif is an important part of the troupe, it is not always the only reason for killing off the female characters (something you will discover is you look under ""lists"" in the WiR site noted in my citation).Finally, the very reason Gail talks about WiR is because she realizes this is extremely sexist. This is exactly what I have picked up on. WiR gives a contemporary/pop reference to a phenomena that was being used by male authors for quite sometime - kill off the woman, use her death to evoke emotion in the readers. In Hawthorne's works, as I mention, the hero and the villain merge together - ultimately resulting in the woman's death - hence evoking the required response from the reader.;Thanks, Martha! That's an interesting topic - the Madwoman in the Attic, I mean. There are so many ways of looking at this particular theme. I am sure you have already done your research, but just to reiterate - don't miss  Wide  Sargasso Sea .  ;@Greg: That is a really an out of the box way of looking at 'The Tell Tale Heart.' I mean I just automatically imagined the killer to be a man!  @ Martha: I understand. I am assuming you are in Fiction of Relationship too. So much to read!!  ;Wow! This time people really did go all out creative, didn't they? A verse and a Woolf-Poe induced short-story. I wonder if another Literature course running in parallel to this had anything to do with these choice of topics.  ;Thanks for sharing, Sean. Very well-written and interesting to read. Your command over the language is very impressive. (I have to admit, I want to know the answer to what Peer 1 has to ask.) In spite of providing a few details about Poe's life, you still manage to talk about the poem's theme as well as the use of language and it's essential overall effect on the reader - and doing all that within the word limit is really commendable.  I understand your need to include the bit about Nabokov's letter. When you know something like that, it is hard not to put it in your essay! I really enjoyed reading Lolita  and I wish I knew this bit when I was reading it.    Thanks again.;"

I'm familiar with all of the standard contemporary interpretations in animated movies and picture books, so the (lack of?) moralizing in many of the stories has come as a surprise to me, or the moral lesson feels a little   _ off (e.g., Faithful John, where the ""right"" thing to do was for the king to behead his two children).Has anyone else noticed the same?;Interesting comment about the parallel between the king and Abraham. I hadn't thought of that, mostly because God doesn't end up actually having Isaac sacrificed, whereas the king actually cuts off his children's heads, not knowing that Faithful John can bring them back to life.I'm going to think more about the Christian themes/Biblical parallels bit in this, it's quite interesting and I hadn't considered it before.;Docility and submissiveness were valued traits in ""underlings"" of any sort: children to their parents, peasants to their lords, lords of their kings and, of course, every human being to God.;I didn't say I found them too drastic to read, just that I was surprised by the moral ambiguity and sometimes apparent lack of a moral lesson to the stories. Oftentimes, things just happen and there's no particular moral lesson from them, whereas Perrault's fairy tales (which I've read before) end with an explicitly stated moral of the story. (For an example, here's Perrault's Blue Beard; scroll to the end to see the moral.);If you read the part about sitting on the rabbit's tail as a sexual metaphor (think about the snake's tail in the Aesop's fable analyzed in the video), then the maiden left home to marry the rabbit because she really had no other choice because she had been (ahem) ""deflowered"" by him. Interesting then, that she lives in a garden with her mother, but no father is mentioned.;I've never heard of the cabbage as a symbol of female fertility. Am I missing something here? Could you elaborate on that a bit? I'm quite interested in this tale, so I'm trying to find out as much as I can, but a quick Google search has done no good so far.;Oh, thank you for that information! I think I have heard that before, but I had forgotten.;The .pdf was a lot more useful and interesting to me once I discovered the highlighter feature. I've been highlighting themes in different colors as I go. I agree that the stories feel a little strange to read, often with anticlimactic resolutions, but I think we're all used to contemporary adaptations, which have been filled out and embellished to better fit a narrative standard.;"

I originally write 600-800 words and then have to weed out paragraphs until I can get it around 300. ;I really like this idea, it is helpful to see so many other people's essay. I realize now that I picked what I assumed to be an original and insightful topic, but clearly many other people wrote about the same thing. However, since this is my first reading of the two books, I am generally pleased with my essay. I   am not sure what peer 4 means by ""your first sentence begs for a citation"". I wrote it, why would I need to cite it?      Dreams are a way of interpreting and processing the things we fear most in life. In ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", Alice fears growing up and leaving childhood behind. Through her dream time in Wonderland, Alice is able to both physically and emotionally grow, and in the process come to terms with her new role as a young woman.                In Wonderland, Alice continually grows and shrinks, and it is this continual shift in size that reflects the internal debate over staying a child and growing up. At first Alice resists the constant changes in size, like when she states ""'I-I'm a little girl.' ... as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day"" (Carroll 51). She tries to convince herself that she is still that same littel girl she used to be.  But as the story continues, see becomes comfortable with and almost unobservant to her shifts in size.                   As Alice moves through Wonderland and becomes more confident in herself, she begins to accept her new role. The scene where Alice nurses the baby shows how Alice is now physically prepared for womanhood. However, she does not really want the responsibility, showing how she may not be emotionally mature yet.                      It is only when Alice accepts her new size and is comfortable with a role of maturity, that she wakes from her dream. Once Alice is back in the real world, there is not just a shift Alice's perception of herself, but also her sister's perception of her. As Alice walks away her sister reflects on how much Alice has grown, ""first she dreamed of little Alice, once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee"" (122). Here it is clear that Alice is not that little girl anymore.                     Alice's journey through Wonderland is not just a frivoulous dream as some might interpret, but rather it is Alice's own way of accepting her fate as a woman and coming to terms with the loss of her childhood. She enters Wonderland a frightened uncertain little girl and emerges a confident woman.  peer 1      The text is well written and clear, but I think you should try to use less paragraphs.peer 2      Your essay has beautiful structure and grammar and it flowed wonderfully. My only complaint is minor and a matter of opinion. Your sentence, ""...showing how she may not be emotionally mature yet."" might sound more professional if structures thus, ""showing how she may not yet be emotionally mature."" Moving ""yet"" to the end of the sentence isn't incorrect -- it just makes the sentence kind of ugly.peer 3      This is a very well written short essay. I think the only improvement that really needs to be made is proof reading. Take this sentence as an example: ""But as the story continues, see becomes comfortable with and almost unobservant to her shifts in size."" You probably shouldn't start sentences with conjunctions and there are several typos that could have been easily caught with a quick proof read. Just some thoughts for the next time.peer 4      Your first sentence begs a citation--but you follow with a sound thesis. You have a few errors in punctuation and grammar, and I feel that these could be eradicated with another read through of your work before submission. I like that you give page numbers from the book to refer to for you reader.Score from peers 2peer 1      I really enjoyed the idea of interpreting alice as a passage from childhood to adulthood and I'd like to hear more about it.peer 2      My essay was on the same topic, though you used different examples and evidence. I enjoyed reading your essay because it pointed out things I had missed during my read-through to include in my own assignment. I struggle to find some way to improve your ideas; so maybe if you'd included more quotes from the books to support your evidence?peer 3      I think this is a really interesting topic. You do a great job setting up your thesis statement and using examples from the text to back up your points. I'm not sure I completely agree with your assessment that Alice goes in a child and comes out as an adult. I think maybe she comes out a little wiser, and perhaps a little less innocent, but still very much a child. Also, make sure to proof read! You're a little over words on the essay. I think you were over 350 words. Using more concise language will help as well. Try no to use so many ""to be"" verbs. There are way too many ""is's"". Thanks for giving me something interesting to think about.

If so I like it, but only 1/3 of the paper is about that. I think that is why you received a 3.  While I think peer 5 was a little harsh, he did have a point that the essay doesn't really say much about the books. Overall. I think that focusing specifically on content for the book will help.  ;Usually I write down ideas or a rough draft on a lot of ideas. Then I choose the one that was the easiest for me to write about, or that I wrote the best about. I almost always end up choosing something different than I originally planned. ;I think this is a really interesting point. i taught an entire class last semester on the hero's journey and we came up with the same conclusion as John Steinbeck when he stated, ""We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the neverending contest in ourselves of good and evil"".  While Harry Potter may pull a lot from Dracula, I think it is a stretch to say it got its inspirtation form it. Thats what makes Harry Potter so great, it pulls from so many sources. Even the characters' names are allusions to other books or myths (even down to Filch's cat - named after Mrs. Norris in Mansfield Park). Teamwork is seen in dozens of fantasy novels (think lord of the rings), and almost every book ever written has a hero with sidekicks. Almost every book ever written also has a wise mentor, (Merlin, Gandalf, a fairy godmother, etc).  I think a fairer assessment might be that both Dracula and Harry Potter pull from similar ideas, beliefs, values, knowledge, etc. They are both relfections about what it means to be human, and good, how to overcome not only the evils of society, but within ourselves. ;As to the ""state my opinion"" part, I have read several essay where the write says ""it is my opinion that"" or something similar. Typically this is frowned upon in writing because it is redundant, but I would suggest not doing that in this class because it wastes space. In an essay so short, using 5 words to tell us something we already know is a waste of space. That space could be used to elaborate on your thesis. ;Laurie, I liked your essay. Your thesis brought up a really interesting idea. Just a suggestion, write shorter sentences. Sentence 1 is four lines long and the 2nd sentence of paragraph 3 is 5 lines long. (But, that is just a suggestion coming from someone who is also prone to lengthy sentences). Otherwise, I really liked your essay.  ;Here is my essay. Also feel free to give feedback, as most of my reviewers didn't bother to write anything.    In Dracula, Stoker demonstrates the timeless battle between the new modern methods of science and old ways of superstition. Through the character of Van Helsing, we see Stoker's claim that science alone is not enough, but that both science and superstition are needed for success.    Throughout the novel, Van Helsing uses science to prolong life and aid the characters in finding Dracula, but this science is not enough. Despite numerous attempts to heal Lucy with scientific blood transfusions, Van Helsing is not able to save her. He also uses the new science of hypnosis to discover Dracula's location, but eventually this too is not enough to lead them directly to Dracula. While science is an aid on their mission to protect themselves and kill Dracula, it alone cannot do the job.    Because Van Hesling represents the bridge between science and superstition, he knows that they need something more powerful than just science. As he explains to Seward, ""it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain"" (227). He tells Seward that while science claims to have all the answers, it in fact was not enough to save Lucy and will not be enough to defeat Dracula.   In the end, it is not science that defeats Dracua, rather it is the religious iconography and superstitious practices that bring him down. Van Helsing uses his knowledge of the old ways to protect them against Dracula, and they use communion wafers, crucifixes, and garlic to ward against his attacks. In the end, when Dracula is killed, Mina even describes it with religious terminology. Upon seeing Dracula crumple to dust on the floor, she  states, ""it was like a miracle, but before our very eyes"" (442). Even Dracula's death is not that of a scientific one, but a magical or religious one.    While many characters represent either the side of science or superstition, Van Helsing is the true mixture of the two. It is through this character that Stoker shows why both are necessary.  ;Laurie, just critique it like you would if it was one of your essays to review please. Pretty much the only comment I received was ""I can't give you a 3 because I didn't learn anything new from your paper, because I wrote about the same topic"". As you can imagine, that wasn't very helpful.   ;All great feedback guys, thanks so much! As you can tell the word limit has been tough for me. I always start off with around 500 words and then hav to narrow it down. I think I originally had something about van Helsing in the intro as my original thesis was about her stoker uses him to bridge the gap between science and superstition, but I cut it out.  It's been a while since I've written a paper, so it's been tough getting back into the swing of things. I appreciate your comments, they were all very helpful! :) ;I agree with Celine's comment. I always find it helpful to start with a broad idea and narrow down. This makes it clearer what your thesis is and helps you elaborate on it. I definitely agree that you should never say ""my thesis is"", but I think your thesis was obvious. You refer back to it frequently in your essay which shows consistency and that you are trying to prove your thesis. I don't think your essay suffered from lack of thesis, just too general of one.  ;Hey theo, before I even start reading your essay, I just had to say that first paragraph was awesome.

In my opinion, your thesis would be sharpened further. Perhaps you would have focus on just one example, and link it more to your thesis?;Hi all,  Below is my essay. Is my essay really as bad as what my peer 1 says? Feel free to criticize it...By choosing to divide the chapters of  Dracula  into various chapters based on the journals or diary entries of the various characters in the novel, Bram Stoker has successfully made the readers immersed themselves into the innermost thoughts and emotions of those characters.Why is this so?By their nature, journals and diary entries are private and are often meant to be read by either the writer themselves, or their closed ones. Therefore, the authors of such entries are often free to write about their innermost thoughts and feelings, as they knew that they would be relatively safe from the prying eyes of nosy strangers.Take for example, in the first chapter, Jonathan Harker wrote in his journal entries about the various meals he had during his journal to Transylvania. Almost as an aside, Jonathan noted that he had asked for the recipe of those dishes for Mina. Such details would normally not be omitted from novels written in the conventional manner, as they are superfluous and not necessary for the progression of the plot. However, Bram, by adding such intimate details into the novel, it makes the readers feel like they are actually peeking into the mind of Jonathan. This has the effect of closing the distance between the reader and Jonathan, and making the readers feel that they understood more about what goes on in Jonathan   s psyche.Furthermore, by their nature, diary entries and journals lack the omniscient narrator, and are based upon the memory of the author themselves. Therefore, their accuracy is not expected to be perfect, just like how human nature is. Precisely due to their imperfect nature and reminiscence to reality, Bram, has succeeded in making the readers feel that the story had really occurred in real life. This would, in turn, make them feel more for the trials and ordeals of the protagonists.Form:peer 1      First of all, it is very obvious that you are not a natural English speaker. Your words are definitely not used properly, there are many mistakes in this regard, for example ""during his journal to Transylvania"" /I believe you meant ""journey""/. English grammar is also very neglected, there is also inproper use of tenses. All in all, it was very hard to follow your thought and you could have probably performed better if you simply used ""Google Translate"". I apologize for the rude comment but you really have to work on your English.peer 4      Very well put up essay. Was a pleasure to read. No grammatical errors i could make out.Content:peer 1      Although I do agree with the thesis that the epistolary structure of the novel contributes to the feeling that the events described in the book actually occurred in reality, your essay wasn't exactly convincing and persuasive. Perhaps the lack of fluency in the language hinders your ability to lay out your arguments clearly. You definitely should put more effort into the task next time.peer 4      A very good essay i had never really noticed this.

I absolutely love all these books, so I'm very excited about the rest of the books on the syllabus!;I don't think having a little information about the author can be like cheating.... maybe through this info you can understand better the motives that induced him/her to write the book and getting another point of view. It's not all about getting just your point of view I guess, but analizing the author's mind at the moment he/her wrote the book can be helpful ;Hm, I can see what you all mean. Nina has worded my concern very eloquently: any supplemental texts are written from the viewpoint of a person, and in some way reflects their thoughts and ideas on the topic, thus ""programming"" the reader's perception. While fretting over dry facts being presented by their proponents vs. opponents is probably going too far in this case, can ideas prompted by another person's understanding of the text be considered our own? Referencing is what I would do too, but there was no word of such option in introductory videos. I guess it boils down to whether the essay is supposed to be strictly the reader's comprehension of the perceived reading material, or a summary of a research the reader is capable and willing to do, analyse through his/her perspective and spit out on the paper? I'm leaning towards first reading the book, writing the draft of the essay, and only then checking out what else is out there... An official standpoint would put my mind at ease though :);You can also send the .pdf files to your kindle email address putting Convert in the subject field. Then as soon as your kindle is connected to internet, the file is converted to whatever format kindle supports.  ;"

But I'm sure what we are expected is to try our best and work to improve :);Good question, I have been wondering about that as well. I tend to look up the author and the work I have just read on Wikipedia (not always the most reliable of sources, I know), and sometimes also on Spark Notes while reading if I find it difficult to understand.

Thanks.;Maybe as soon as the post-medieval realized that the mice were the main carriers of disease, but I really couldn't answer. The Grimm brothers very often mix medieval and pre-modern (as in the transition of medieval to modern times) with modern behaviors, places and objects. They were not the only ones, but the moralizing themes in their tales (or better: their takes on popular tales) may somewhat justify that, since they were trying to reach their contemporaries and at the same time maintain a sort of moral tradition. ;Megan - spoke to a good friend who writes wonderful modern history historical novels. Of course I mentioned fantasy as a crime novel. His latest one is set in Italy in the Red Bragade era. We got in a lively discussion but he certainly didn't agree. ;If I heard the video correctly, the instructor said something along the lines of ""if you turn in all your assignments on time and they meet the criteria, you will get an ""A.""   This leads me to believe that the peer reviews are a vehicle to critically analyze the essays of our classmates and gain alternate perspectives of the reading assignments, thus enriching our own experiences and thought processes.   Likewise, the peer reviews allow us to share our own perspectives and thoughts with other students regarding their own essays.   I think the intention is to learn how to provide and process constructive criticism to the benefit of all parties.   To that end, if you (in general) consistently receive 1's on your essays, then you aren't reading the comments and taking them to heart to improve your writing.   Again, paraphrasing the video, when you complete the course, if you have done all the assignments, your writing and thinking will have improved through the process of peer review.;I agree with everyone of Studio Ghibli, especially those by Hayao Miyazaki.Along the lines of anime I would also reccomend a series i just finished, Towa no quon.

I believe it makes my job easier, because we can talk about what we read without the need to translate it :);I find interesting the way this topic (Medievalism and Romanticism in Grimm's tales) is somehow present in the film about the Grimm Brothers by Terry Gilliam. In The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, another film by Gilliam, the plot reminds me of Six soldiers of fortune, the second tale in Lucy Crane's version. You can see 'firearms"" in both films, althoug I don't know how reliable the setting can be, as they are fantasy films indeed.;When I was 3 (circa 1967) I dreamed about rockets coming out of my feet.   I had to hold onto furniture to keep from flying away.   I always thought this was an odd dream for a little kid to have, wondered if ALIEN ABDUCTION had something to do with it.   Thirty years later there was an Outer Limits marathon on, and I think I must have been an avid watcher, because one of the episodes was VERY similar to my dream.   I've always wondered about collective memory, though.   I remember as a child, the first time I saw pictures of the pyramids and Stonehenge, I had this ""oh yeahhh"" feeling, like I was supposed to know what they were for......and just couldn't recall.....;This is an interesting take on the tales - and I think points to how the tales each appeal to people in an individualized manner. For myself I am finding that while I'm enjoying my old favourites at a certain level, I am far more enthralled with ones that I have never read before.   The Six Soldiers of Fortune is my new favourite, followed closely by the Robber Bridegroom (probably due to it's gothic flavor).   I'm fairly sure it's not simply novelty which is influencing me this way - I'm certainly not enjoying all new ones, certainly not all to the same extent - though it may be part of it. Thus, while the familiarity of specific tales may be the overriding factor for some, for myself it is the weaving of the fantastical elements and the possibility of enlarging my imagination. I am also finding the ethnic part of this discussion interesting. As one  of Ukrainian and Danish heritage, I know that I find Ukrainian and Danish folklore more appealing than the Grimm tales. I'm not sure that it is because they are more familiar - because I grew up with Danish and Grimm tales, and my grandmother orally passed down Ukrainian ones.;wow, excellent point Anna. I wonder how much that has been studied. Sociology or literature or both for more info, do you think?;I'm using the copy from the Gutenberg project (http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068): epub for my e-reader, and html for the PC. Very convenient, since this is the same copy, so it 100% syncs;When I read the one about the Rabbit, I definitely thought sex and domestic abuse. There are a few others where authors I think imply sex (or sexual harassment), but certainly couldn't be blunt about it at the time, even if they'd have been writing an adult story. E.g. in The Goose Girl ""she sat down and began to comb out her hair; then Conrad came up and wanted to seize upon some of it"". Yeah, right, like he'd care about her hair sooo much.I believe other animals in the story represent a bunch of Rabbit's buddies. None of the ""people"" present is human - meaning none of the Bride's friends and relatives are there. So she feels lonely and threatened, because she knows no one, and if anything happens, no one will stand up for her.I couldn't find any other meaning behind Six Soldiers of Fortune except the superhero idea and vengeance/ restoring justice. No socialistic feel either: with the power the group have, they can easily throw over the king, yet they don't even consider any other way to go about seizing power except marrying the princess, because the birth right of the monarchy is still sacred.;In Roland, drops of blood talk in stead of the dead person they come from - seem in line with the believe that in blood resides the soul, thus giving it magical properties, though I might be wrong...;Now that I'm rereading the  Six Soldiers of Fortune, it appears to be a warning tale too, only this time to the ruler: honestly pay to your  faithful  servants, or you may lose much more than their salary.;I bet she is. Take The Elves: they do your work perfectly for you, and you release them by giving them closes. This does ring a bell, doesn't it? ;)  ;That's a very good question!Hm, I suppose going too far back in time and/or space despite being very interesting might have required a lot of background knowledge not everyone would have and/or lots of additional research to grasp the workings of the human mind behind the stories.  So we limit ourselves to the European/American tradition of the latest 200 years - the one most familiar to the English speaking audience; and writing of manageable size. Mind, I'm just thinking out loud here, and can be on the totally wrong track.The first half of the reading list consists of the novels and stories that are so much of a cultural heritage, finding someone who doesn't know what they are about even without reading the originals is rather difficult (and I fervently hope this is not going to be changed by glittery vampires any time soon). The second half I haven't cracked yet. Different subgenres? Dunno. Looking forward to hearing more ideas on the topic;Thank you for creating this thread, I'm looking forward to seeing what people recommend!For the sake of informative value, I'll avoid the books from the course list and those on the summit of popularity now, who would have made the list  otherwise  (Tolkien,  George R. R. Martin). So:1.  Flowers for Algernon by  Daniel Keyes2.  The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov3. Henry Kuttner's Hogben stories4. Night Watch by Sergei Lukyananko (the whole pentalogy really)5. Isaac Asimov's short stories (Nightfall, The Martian Way etc);I hear you. It's similar to traveling with a digital camera: instead of taking the sights in and savoring the experience, I'd constantly look for good shots. Thank you, but no, thank you. I take photos exclusively when I spot something irresistible. I take notes when I come across a phrase or notion that stirs something within and makes my hand subconsciously reach for a pen and notebook. Or, like you said, my own ideas inspired by the piece. Such approach might be troublesome on occasion, when the need to analyse arises, and yet, I find it more beneficial if I want to see the forest instead of the trees  ;Erm, don't you think you're being too hard on the cock? It's the hen who triggers the whole domino effect by going back on their deal, and the cock is merely being a good husband by trying to save her. Honestly, I fail to see how he is ignorant, and the arguments here are not shedding any light for me either. Maybe only not recognizing the intents of other beasts could count as such, but then again, what is he to say? No, you can't come with me, eat us up right here, if you will. If this thesis is to work, I believe it needs to have stronger support of the arguments throughout the analysis.;Valid arguments, thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.I'm currently half-way through the novel, and I feel Stoker maintains a good balance between writing his female lead as a smart and industrious woman with an active stance in life, and remaining within the constrains of his contemporary culture. Mina mentions that she ""never knew either father or mother"", which explains her ability and readiness to stand for herself and her loved ones; and that ""you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit"", which accounts for her willingness to step into the approved female role she was taught to pursue from young age. Granted, after the female bashing that was Grimm stories, I might be overly more forgivable than usual :);While reading the first story, I had a strong feeling of the whole Wonderland being the world of adults - ridiculous as it appears through eyes of a child - and ""high"" society at that. I've yet to read any additional sources, so if I'm talking nonsense, please, let me down gently :)Coming from the adult world theory, who is the Queen of Hearts? Not any allusions to the real Queen I imagine - that would be too unimaginative. So, my theory is fate. If one wants to be in the high society, he/she has to play this game of chance (croquet here), where it's possible to be in favour one moment, and on the verge of loosing everything at another. Moreover, ""tools"" (employees? servants?) independently factor in - they can take sides, or throw a spanner in the works by merely being stubborn. Thoughts?;"

This can be a risky endeavor even at present with all our laws to protect the freedom of speech and other human rights...Thanks for your thoughts, guys!;Great lecture! I tried my best to keep my mind open while reading, but the insight presented in the videos still blew my mind. Especially loved the scientific bits in the one about structure and meanings - universal concepts of the human culture have always fascinated me. Thank you!;That's what makes HP such a prolific ground for fanfiction ;);I believe those percentages are more like guidelines to stop people from downgrading every other essay for small details or marking everyone with 3s for encouragement. 2 is the default mark. I gave only one 1, when I couldn't make out what half of the essay was about, and one 3, when I couldn't think of any advise for improvement.I wonder how the average we see when our assignments come back is counted - the step seems to be a half (3, 3.5, 4 etc), at least I haven't seen anyone share any 4.2s or similar. Does this mean singular 1s and 3s get lost in rounding off?  ;Hm, I'm confused. I do of course realize fractional grades can only happen when all the scores from different peers are averaged, and only if they are different in the first place. But you speak of an individual score. I can see only totals for form, content and overall for my essay - is there any way to get access to grades given by each separate peer?;Ah, that was a nice thought :) Oh, well;Added to my reading list, thanks for the recommendation!As far as the topic of the thread goes, I remember complaining about  Ulysses in similar way back in college I think. Then a friend of mine suggested I either find someone to explain it to me or read up on the critical material, and only then can I complain about this brilliant piece in her presence. This was a lesson I won't forget: one is  absolutely entitled to a personal opinion of a book, but not before giving it an honest and wholehearted effort.;Hm, you run the risk of shifting the highlight to that modern piece, only using the one we study instead of actually studying it. This is rather risky - if the essay is well-researched and written, I wouldn't downgrade it, but I can see other students rejecting the approach.;Glad to be of service. You know, as long as you put in honest work and have fun, there's no way you can fail ;) Good luck!;I don't know about beautiful, but Once Upon a Time TV series is heavily based on Grimms' fairy tales, Alice, Pinocchio etc, whose characters are stuck in a modern town reliving their fairy-tale roles without knowing it or being able to change anything, unless...;I think it makes a lot of sense, Paul. As a child, I read Alice in Russian translation (BTW, can't wait to compare it to the original now, and see how well it is translated), and found it quite brilliant. Wished my dreams were so lucid and fun! Maybe the rejection has something to do with never being exposed to this book back when the mind was still flexible? Or mere incompatibility of the author's personality type to one of the reader? :) Dunno.I'm a bit surprised to see that readers expect little children to not miss their home, lack of responsibility for their own sustenance, safety, parents...;Oh, I know - my dream as a child was to end up on a desert island all alone :) A few times I admitted to this, people - my peers mostly - stared at me like I was out of my mind. So I believe for overwhelming majority even the idea itself is hard to swallow. If you factor in the danger main characters encounter during such adventures, even I can relate to their goal... Maybe if they were from abusive surroundings, it would be a different story...Speaking of a goal, you got me wondering - there should be one in a plot, so that the character's actions had some...direction, purpose if you will. Let's imagine neither Alice nor Dorothy strive to return home. Theoretically, what could be their major goal?;*pouts* But I like plots... And I'm a very goal-oriented person... Oh, well :);Well, though I've liked the Alice dilogy well enough for its mere artistic merit, comments on the social background definitely add some layer of appreciation. Only I'm not sure whether this is 'English' or historical part of it. ;Not much to contribute, except I recall hearing about the theory that we all live in the God's dream/mind. Should he forget about a person, (s)he will cease to exist. Unfortunately, I don't remember where I heard this, it was a long time ago...;That's an interesting question! Hm, I'm not intimately familiar with literature of the period, but if I remember correctly, first person and omniscient point of view were generally used. The former limits the piece to experiences of only one person, so can be unsuitable if there's a lot going on, or if main character is unconscious/asleep/otherwise indisposed at some crucial points. The latter requires considerable efforts to create suspense.Off the top of my head, letters and diaries allow the author to:limit the number of PoV characters without keeping only one,dive deeper into the character's personality (diaries) and their relationships with others (letters),show the same events through the prism of different perceptions,naturally hide some stuff, or inform the reader bit by bit,  create some additional suspense by simply having a character abstain from writing,avoid writing many dialogues while still retaining the communication part of the story,  create false impression of recovered record that shows true events.Just my musings, would love to see what other students think;Maybe this will become an issue further into the course... Based on my experience with the 1st assignment, the percentage seems perfectly valid. There're plenty of people here who haven't had much experience with writing essays/non-scientific essays/in English.When push comes to shove, I highly doubt you'll be penalized for giving out as many 3s as you want, if you truly believe the work to be beyond improving. After all, since assignment of peers is randomized, someone else can get  essays  that are all  average instead.As far as the criteria are concerned, I'd add continuity (sentences flow from one into the next in a manner that is easy to read), wide use of advanced vocabulary and proper style (no contractions, varied sentence structures etc);I agree with your point - a 270-320 word essay that requires a dictionary to decipher would clearly be an exaggeration :) And of course, this is only one of the criteria that should ideally accompany each other.What I meant by advanced vocabulary is the use of words that are a step-up from basic learner's vocab... Hm, that doesn't come out right. An example: she was angry with him for what he did vs. his actions infuriated her. Both are (hopefully:)) grammatically correct, and neither sends an advanced student to fetch a dictionary, yet I find the second one to be more advanced and pleasing to read in academic setting.Anyway, the initial question was about what would take a student closer to submitting an ideal essay, not merely a passable one. The points Peter lists easily make up an essay worthy of 2, as far as I'm concerned. If I see one which uses simple words, but weaves them on Hemingway's level, I'd have no problem ranking it higher!;I recognize the point you guys are making, as I have commented on the lack of paragraphs twice during the first review session. However, Joshua, don't you suppose it's a bit too harsh to fail a student, who spent days reading the assigned material and thinking on the thesis, then hours writing and editing the essay itself, only because their formatting causes you seconds worth of displeasure? This, of course, assuming the work you're referring to has no other issues, as it appears from the post.Whereas Paul is right, we will lose the majority of students by the end of the course, I believe it to be very important that they leave only because they feel they can't manage the workload under their circumstances, not because overly strict treatment of peers discourages them from participating.;Have you heard of a criticism sandwich? Praise on top and bottom, constructive criticism in the middle. And there's always something to praise if one will just look. I simply believe it unfair to penalize student for a small mistake, but overlook plenty of positive points.As far as soft skin goes, forgive me my abruptness, but this sounds rather like abuse. 9 out of 10 students will take constructive criticism, I'm sure, in the spirit it's offered, as long as you make the effort to explain what is seriously wrong with their essay. The only one I gave 1 to lacked both the thesis and conclusion, and half of it was written in unintelligible English - puts things into perspective, doesn't it? Yet, my version of ""better safe than sorry"" is trusting that the person put as much effort in it as I did in mine, and deserves fair consideration instead of a brush off. Why should anyone else do the job I wouldn't?;Oh, no, dear, I didn't think it was directed at me, or I wouldn't reply so harshly :) You can say I was being a mother hen to our fellow students. Ok, to myself too: I take criticism rather well, outright bashing - not so much.  The freedom to express our honest opinions of the piece certainly has it's pros and cons. At least, having our own essays reviewed by someone this very moment should hopefully remind that we should be ready to take what we dish out!;Well, apparently, Carroll was the first author to write a book for children that didn't have any moral for them to learn. I've noticed many instances of him mocking moral lessons and the education system in general. Comments in the recommended edition note that too.P.S. Erm, moral isn't the main point of the Grimm tales - Professor speaks of this in the Unit 1 lectures.;Definitely 3rd person. As a child, I for some reason perceived 1st person as 2nd instead: like I'm being told what I do, where I go etc. This used to irritate me to no end. And though I've overcome this dislike by now, and can enjoy 1st person well enough, some preference for 3rd person remains;I quite enjoyed the novel. The instances you guys have mentioned also earned an eyeroll from me, as well as the men leaving Mina in ""safety"" of the asylum to go hunt the Count. Guess Stoker didn't see enough horror-movies to realize how obvious an opening that is, he-he. But overall, this was an enjoyable read. After so many movies about vampires to finally get so close to the inception and connect the dots of where the whole idea comes from is really exciting.P.S. It turns out Van Helsing is a Dracula character - don't laugh, but that was a surprise to me!;I think your thesis makes sense if we go into the definition of ""mad"". What is insanity anyhow? Isn't this mostly a social notion which means ""deemed weird, impossible to understand, and maybe dangerous by the majority""? The majority of the real world are rather similar to Alice, so she's considered perfectly sane here. However, in the Wonderland she sticks out from what is the norm there, which makes her appear insane in it's inhabitants' eyes.This is not the way I see the book, which makes your perspective even more insightful to me. Thanks for sharing and good luck with your grade!;It would be interesting to see a breakdown of essay subjectsThat's a very interesting idea, I'd love to see that too!;Interesting essay - I especially loved the quote from  Andras Feldmar, and ensuing conclusion. The parallel between strict rules of games in Wonderland and the real life, which don't quite work in neither is quite insightful too.Critique wise - I believe the consensus is to include a thesis in the first paragraph. Without it I have troubles understanding what the main point is. The 2nd paragraph first states that children book characters should be good or evil, then goes on to say this is not so in Alice. Do you mean children cannot understand the book or relate to the character?What I've spotted grammar wise:  For a child it is equally difficult to... as...;  preventing adults from...Hope that's helpful. Thanks for sharing!;Wow, that's pretty crazy!There's a tiny ""flag"" link at the right bottom of the essay - maybe this is one of the cases it's to be used for?;Well, if you speak of the essay assignments, we're supposed to support our take on the reading material with evidence. Sometimes the author him/herself doesn't realize the full meaning of what (s)he has written (Freudian slip anyone?), so there's nothing inherently right or wrong in the way each student perceives the text. You can always drop by the forum, and see what others think of your idea, and whether some good counterargument can be offered.Welcome, and good luck catching up!;"

Hm, I definitely had no problem telling the PoV characters apart, though it may be largely due to different topics and attitude to them expressed in their passages. I also have very clear visuals of Lucy and Mina, but not of the men, so you may be on to something.Well, in Frankenstein about 95% (no hard data, just approximation) is in Victor's PoV, and since he's a rather self-absorbed character to put it mildly, the reliability of the details of others' words and behaviour is uncertain.  ;As a non-native speaker, I can relate.

And even the same type of blood can easily be incompatible due to less known nuances.Unfortunately, Stoker couldn't have known that - blood types were only discovered in 1900, so he probably followed the usual misconception of the time - if they love her, their blood won't kill her :) Or maybe Dracula has a poison on his fangs that transmutes victim's blood into AB+? Or the transfusions really did kill her - some of the symptoms can be interpreted that way...;English wasn't a lingua franca yet, French was. So his wide English vocabulary and understandable though accented speech is pretty impressive I believe;I second Sean: if it was a science course, making us struggle through the material and then deliver it would be frustrating and unnecessary. However, this is a literature course - the Professor's opinion, though much more experienced, is just that, an opinion. Much of it is based on his age, personal experiences... Like with Alice - the theme of death seems more relevant to him, which definitely enlightened me, but I've found themes more relevant to me, exactly because I didn't hear that before starting.Essentially, I believe this course is aimed at teaching us to read critically and think for ourselves, when we have graduated and endeavor to read some next book, instead of feeding us some preconceived notions about some specific reading material.;Lucy invited him some time before that - only the first invitation is needed.;Megan explains things brilliantly as always, I second every word.I can relate to feeling you have more interesting ideas you'd like to share. Remember, you can always post them on the forum. While you won't get grades, you may get to discuss your thoughts in more detail than in the essay, and get different opinions that will widen your perception of the book whether you agree with them or not.;I second that - seeing that we were actually encouraged to start reading longer pieces even before the course started, it seems counterproductive to withhold introductory videos about them. I always prefer to read in advance, and mostly finish by Thursday so that I had time to think on the essay, discuss some details on the forum etc. In fact, discovering that I'd been reading the edition of Alice different from the recommended one, and still had about 100 pages of comments to go through threw me so much, I almost ended up skipping the essay. So if the videos are prerecorded anyway, early release would be appreciated!;I'm one third through Frankenstein, and for the first time in ages fail to find any redeemable qualities in the main character... Not only does he have foresight and responsibility of a three-year old (""The mess I've created ran away - hurrah! I'll just leave others to deal with it and go on my marry way.""), he also leaps to conclusions at miles per second, has zero attention to evidence (achievements in science? rrrrright), gets completely blinded by prejudice, and complains that he's the most miserable man ever only a few times per chapter. What's not to like? Please, tell me it gets better! Because right now I'm inclined to attribute long-standing attitude towards scifi-fantasy as not serious writing to Mrs. Shelley's single-handed efforts...;I'll keep that in mind, thanks. I kind of keep hoping I'm not getting something - this is a case when being proven wrong would be rather nice :);Thanks, I'll be looking forward to that!;An excellent advice for dealing with real-life ""characters"" of that type. ""if you can't avoid them"" I would add. The problem I have with Victor is that in addition to all those features, unlike real people I can't get where he's coming from. His biography and behaviour scream impostor, so much they don't fit. That, and the fact that I can't hit him over the head for being an idiot - now that would help!;So many interesting thoughts, thank you, guys!John, I'm half-way through at the moment, and definitely sympathize with the monster more. Call it mother instinct. Because unlike Victor monster mentally is a child - he is what three? four? when they meet again. He behaves according to his age, only since his physical power exceeds one of a child, he can wreck more havoc is all... Hm, I might have an idea for a thesis, thanks!P.S. I wonder if Professor will remind us about Hansel and Grethel - Victor takes on the life-giving job of a female, and that's why it doesn't work out for him;It was my knee-jerk reaction while reading too. But then I remembered the lecture about the unlucky sods who tried to challenge gender roles in fairy tales and paid dearly, and it made me wonder... :);Do I need to relate to characters to enjoy the story? Hell, yeah! Especially the main one. The character doesn't have to be awfully smart (Forrest Gump), or virtuous (Hannibal Lecter), but I must understand where he's coming from, sympathize with his plights or be spooked by his endeavours. I don't believe it good for a book if its endless angst makes me crave crappy fanfics, because it's less pronounced there!On the other hand, I don't think I have ever had so many possible theses written out by the end of reading - apparently, the desire to rationalize facilitates good critical reading!;I considered joining this one too, but decided that two courses that require tons of reading at once would be too much. I take my hat  off  to you guys.My heartfelt sympathies, Javier, - romance as a main plot line can be very exhausting to someone who doesn't particularly enjoy the angsty side of it (and I'm right there with you). Why does ""relationship"" automatically equal ""romance"" anyway? Hope it gets better, or I'll have to revisit my intention to join the next time they run the course...;It has been mentioned  here  that Lucy had negligently low chance of surviving so many transfusions. But technical issues aside, blood appears to be granted more metaphysical importance than it is usual now.First, there're those transfusions. Lucy and Arthur know only about the first one, and both claim they feel already married afterwards. The experiments on blood transfusion between humans I found mentioned for the time period were all conducted between spouses...Then there's the vampires' blood drinking habit, which appears symbolic of sexual intercourse.It seems that blood exchange here is compared to the exchange of other fluids with all the psychological and social consequences. Thoughts?  ;Very interesting question raised, Himanshu. Here are my two cents.Allow me to use your snake example, and ask - where do you know its symbolic meaning from? You might not remember, but you weren't born with this knowledge surely. At some point, someone taught you that, or you drew the conclusion by reading a few books that used the image. What seems intuitive now is actually a result of literature analysis and critical reading that occurred some time in the past.What I'm saying is it might feel laborious right now, because we need to actively think about symbolism in the books, read on the background etc., but thanks to it some time in the future you'll be subconsciously noticing those little details, and they'll add a layer of understanding and fun into your reading; you'll be slipping the images into your writing without actively thinking about it and believe it intuitive. Because intuition comes from our background knowledge, that this course is shaping about now.I was slightly anxious when I first started reading critically - it did seem like I was taking away the magic from the reading. However, very soon I felt I started appreciating good writing not less but more!As it has been said, there's no universal truth, but give it an honest chance. Willingness to experiment is a good trait for an author :);"

By then Mary already lost her prematurely born child, reportedly hallucinated about her, then had another child... Oh, and while she was pregnant for the first time, Percy's wife gave birth to another child of his, so he was spending time with her or... with Mary's step-sister. Abandonment issues all the way;Marc, they influence my understanding of the reading.

Hm, should I jump that ship? ;)Made up or not, no one said there can't be a grain of truth in thereEdit: On second glance, it appears Victor is what Walton has always wanted to be - an educated man. So he admires Victor so much, he trusts that nothing he comes up with can possibly be wrong - Walton must be simply to uncouth to understand it  ;Beautiful text analysis. Jeremy, if this were an essay, I'd give it full points!;A study of pride and ambition? Definitely. There's clearly scientist's responsibility in this one too. Also, it's not tackled directly in the novel, but somewhat reads if we consider the monster literally and in view of recent genetic advances, - does the monster have a soul? Victor seems to treat him as if he's merely a guinea pig, or a zombie for whose life he has full unrestricted rights, but is it so? Moral reasons are the only thing that momentarily stops human cloning, but this will probably not last forever.;Interesting point, I can see what you mean. So you think he's got mental illness and isn't just spoiled rotten? Hm, that's an option.Allow me to join in on the 21st century view! Dibs on cloning. So, some scientist creates a mutant in his home lab, freaks out and lets the creature escape. Let's skip legal trivialities of whether human cloning is allowed in the country in question for a moment. Will anyone care whether the scientist and the monster are mentally challenged? It probably won't have any bearing on the case. If I happened to watch a movie with such plot - yeah, I would expect Victor to tough it out, or at least seek help. Or die out like a mammoth asap.Duh, I think like a modern reader - if the creator is a whiny brat, the author should find another character who'll deal with the situation :);I second that.Actually, Victor has another younger brother left, whose fate we never get to hear about. Of course, it's not like Victor cares how the poor boy feels after loosing his whole family, and not having the privilege of knowing why.;Just finished reading the Birthmark, and the first thought is the striking parallel between it and Poe's Oval Portrait. Both protags are obsessed with (i) their wife's beauty, (ii) their chosen vocation. And the mix of the two is equally deadly in both stories...;Nice article, though I didn't care for the catchy title.  JK Rowling is doubtlessly a well-read woman, and her references to other works of literature are subtle, seamlessly incorporated into the text, and help us relate to her work more, even if we can't put our collective finger on why sometimes.I feel like collecting all the influences of different pieces on HP would be a curious  endeavor. You all have spotted some good stuff; then there was this idea with elf servants being released when their hosts give them clothes in Grimm fairy tales. When I was recently reading Oscar Wilde's fairy tales, the Remarkable Rocket stroke me as very obviously Umbridge. Personal collection growth :)Love this course!;Additional Introduction is available here. I flipped through the rest of the text, and it doesn't appear to have any changes compared to the 1st edition at first glance...;I read the 1818 version from Gutenberg which does have the preface... this one.  No spoilers :)Anyway, it's included into the 1831 version;Though peer reviews do happen to be bipolar on occasion, is everything in fact about them? The exercise of analyzing a book, picking a topic and arguing it in concise form should improve both one's understanding of the material and writing by itself - at least, I feel it does to me. Constructive critique is an icing on the cake, not the cake itself.My latest batch was overall the least encouraging of all with some comments that without examples I have no chance to fully understand. Nevertheless, I feel I've learned from it the most, and my ego will recover soon enough :);Now, when we are three essays into the course, it seems like high time to ask about the general approach to writing different students use.Those who have had recent experience of similar writing for your studies / job: do you apply what you've learnt from there to assignments here, or do you go crazy while you can?Those, for whom this course is a fresh start / reprieve from routine: how do you decide what to write and how?Does anything change in your writing from unit to unit?;Answering my own questions: since formal education in my country prefers collection information over interpreting it or making personal opinions known, this experience is quite new to me.The first essay was about a notion common to many fairy-tales ('cause I was too afraid to pick one - what if that was not the right thing to do!), didn't provide quotes, but used five additional sources, and was so formal, one of the peers said it resembled an encyclopedia article - and so it did :) The second one concentrated on one scene in Alice, interpreted it in a crazy way no one seemed to expect, and was sliiiightly less formal. The third one was a compare-and-contrast, as informal as I dared... and now I want to try something else entirely!  ;Very interesting take, Kevin! Prof. Rabkin did hint at possible unreliable narrator in Frankenstein too. And you have good arguments.As for counterarguments, I also thought of Victor's alibi for William's death first thing. However, since everything we know about it we know from Victor... He does plan on going home about that time in any case, so maybe he manages to go and return in time to receive the letter?The trial over Clerval's death seems very fishy. It's postponed for the period of Victor's illness (a few months), which makes his witnesses' memory quite remarkable - I'll admit I wouldn't recall having an inane conversation with someone or other at exact time few months back.The weakest link, I believe, is sailors spotting someone before they meet Frankenstein. Unless, despite the unlikely place, it's just anyone... Some Russian bear hunter :)Good luck!;The topic is very interesting, but are you sure the time frame is right? According to wikipedia (not the most reliable source, I know, but worth double-checking), Mery went to Switzerland, where she wrote Frankenstein, with her little son she'd already given birth to after the first baby's death. Both her half-sister and Percy's wife committed suicides a few months later. I was using a biography with large chunks from their journals (on Gutenberg) for my essay, but didn't get this far.;I dropped by the bookstore on the way to work today, and on a whim bought Kafka's collection.

Will have to wait almost 2 months till our Independence Day :);This is indeed an interesting challenge, I might take part if time permits.However, Florencia is right in that it's a task quite different from what we do in our assignments. In our essays for the course we need to provide some additional insight to what is in the book. We don't have to worry about spoilers either. In this ""promo"" essay, we'd be supposed to intrigue more than anything, to explain what we like about the book without disclosing some crucial points... which might as well be what we like there the most!;It seems logical that since we receive 5 reviews by default each (unless one of our reviewers doesn't submit his/her assessment), we are expected to dish out 5 of them too. Each review you don't complete is one person who receives one review less, while you likely still get all 5. Sounds unfair, doesn't it?As far as corrections go, are there any repeated patterns or mistakes which don't let you understand what the person actually means? Comment on them first.;I was taught throughout my formal education that a research that is shorter than 10 pages is too short to offer any insight. Stuffing all I want to say into 320 words is one thing, choosing a topic that would be specific enough for this to be even in theory possible is a great challenge to me. But no learning happens without a challenge, does it?;I didn't look to deeply into this point, but actions of the character in your example don't seem without logic to me. Twisted logic of a person with a mental disorder, but logic nonetheless.You know this feeling when something gets on your nerves? Be it a new clock which ticking you aren't used to yet, so it sounds deafening in the dead of night, or a person sitting at the next desk in the library and beating some rhythm with the pencil against the desk. Usually, we either get used to the disturbance or move away irritated. The character of the Tale tale heart seems capable of neither, and prone to hallucinations to boot, so he finally loses it. At least, this is the way I see it. Though I'd love to learn what kind of disorder he exhibits, and how Poe knew enough intimate details to built such a persuasive PoV...;Thanks for the link, this does seem part of what the guy experiences.I agree, not being able to rationalize contributes to the horror. To me, it's also the thought that this can happen to anyone anytime: without symptoms to spot, we can suffer from people we have trusted for a long time... and that's where paranoia is born ;);Not sure which one was the first: there have always been some random collections of short stories at home. I know that I read Alice in Wonderland and Fellowship of the Ring before school, and Martian Chronicles were part of the school program... Then, there's  Kir Bulychov, of course - with his series of novels and stories about a girl from the future called Alice. Still love them to bits!;It's been quite educational to encounter well-placed references to notions and sources I didn't encounter before, so far as their points of relevance have been explained. Every essay that broadens my view is truly appreciated.However, today I've come across a different matter: two of the essays assigned to me refer to Poe's  The Masque of the Red Death in a way that presumes I've read it and is supposed to get what is said at once. But I didn't, since it isn't in the list of the assigned reading. Is it? This is a short story, so I'll certainly try to read it and evaluate those works before deadline. However, I find myself dismayed by such attitude of the fellow students. The workload is quite heavy  as it is  for someone who has RL stuff going on too, like you know making a living...What do you think?;Wow, didn't realize this problem would be so common... which is a sad trend.@ Florencia, neither of mine is only about this story, but both use such particular details for arguments, that they don't make any sense to me at all... Though you are right about comparing our texts to widely known works of literature - we certainly have been pointed at many links to the Bible for one, good point.@ Jeremy, definitely a  plagiarism check is in order (though neither essay looks really brilliant, so I honestly doubt anything particularly incriminating will pop up). I would have read this story back in school, but it's been good fifteen years, so the memory is hazy at best. I've been planning to finish Portable Poe - there's a lot of really good stuff there.

But since I want to do better, there goes. Any comments are appreciated.---  Beautiful garden in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story  Rappaccini's daughter  is clearly meant as a representation of the garden of Eden     being called so on several occasions within the story. Yet, having resulted from creative efforts of a man, this version of Eden is as warped as the broken fountain in its center.  An    Adam    Dr. Rappaccini has created assumes the shape of a beautiful girl     a child of his blood, and thus his image to the largest extent possible for a female. Her mother is never mentioned, but assumed, to lend this creation the credibility of a natural deed (lacking in Victor Frankenstein's endeavor) along with the feel of God's single-handed creation. Being apparently a benevolent creator, Dr. Rappaccini grants Beatrice an unspoken wish for a mate, making an    Eve    out of whoever she likes best      male as per reversed fictitious reality.  Beatrice's unnatural talents, and the way Giovanni appears to be lured into the garden makes us associate her with a poisonous snake. Indeed, akin to an animal, her deadly ability is only a natural instinct she cannot be held accountable for, while her inner nature is pure. Dr. Baglioni on the other hand is the real seducer     jealous and vindictive, he slithers into Giovanni's confidence and slips him the deadly    apple   .  The distribution of roles in the story makes for an ambiguous impression:    God    creates a menace to human lives for purposes undisclosed to the reader, whereas    Devil    thwarts his plans for selfish reasons, ultimately ending up with a result that probably benefits the humanity as a whole. In this skewed reality, we see that man dabbling in God   s business is so much of a threat to the natural order, that a malignant character is portrayed as one to restore it.Form (2)peer 2      An interesting essay that flows well but there can be improvements.

For one thing, they do have a reverence for relics of the dead. In the churches it is not unusual to see skulls on display. There is a monastery in Budapest in which the ceiling is made up of the bones of the deceased monks. To an American, this seems a bit macabre, but there, it is a reverence for the saints and completely natural. ;Yes there are relics in American Catholic Churches , but they are not on display as they are in Europe.

Throughout history, and today is no exception, people always have strived either to have more, or to have something better than what we have. Aylmer had a very beautiful wife, but wanted her to be perfect, so he sought to use his scientific skills, which he knew sometimes failed as is the nature of experiments, to make her perfect.

The chance to have these discussions is amazing! We all benefit. What we gain is perhaps a new way or ways of looking at things.

By removing her birthmark, he took away that which makes her human, so she had to die.  Could it be the hand of God? ;This story really speaks to me, because it tells of how difficult it can be to nurture an artistic spirit when so many do not understand the value of art for art's sake. It also speaks to our need for approval which just stops us in our tracks sometimes. We need to pursue what interests us because it interests us and not care what anyone else thinks about it.

I don't think the artist needs our sympathy, because, in the end, he achieved his goal; he made his beautiful butterfly, and it was a total success.

Through much of the story, he was hoping for Annie's approval, but even that, he ultimately realized was not important. ;Intrinsic motivation is the hardest concept to get across to elementary age students.

Here's your chance to fire back at a reviewer!;Well, I suppose it's only fair!   ;-)Throughout  Alice   s escapades in Wonderland and the Looking-Glass, she is bombarded  by a strange array of characters speaking in riddles and preposterous  phrases.   The nonsensical fashion in which these characters speak  parallels regional dialects and points a satirical finger at the  breakdown in communication that occurs from differing dialects; forcing  the reader to contemplate their own use of language and colloquialisms. Posed with a seemingly impossible riddle and assaulted with frenetic  conversations, Alice is quickly entrenched in the whirlwind madness of  the Mad Hatter and the March Hare.   To both the reader and Alice, the  Hatter and the Hare appear ridiculous and non sequitur in thought and  speech.   However, this proves to be par for Wonderland and the only  confused parties are Alice and the reader. Communications are further  complicated by the Hatter and the Hare   s inability to understand Alice   s  particular phrasings.   She is told to    say what she means    as her word  choices and sentence structures are analyzed in the most literal of  senses.     Alice faces a similarly bewildering exchange with Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking-Glass.    Her simple questions are referred to as    riddles    and, much like with  the Hatter and the Hare, her unassuming responses are taken literally  and misunderstood.   Anyone who has attempted a conversation in a language other than  their native tongue   or even with those speaking a varying dialect of  their own   may relate to Alice   s experience.   Standard colloquialisms and  idioms are often misinterpreted under these circumstances.   To say to a  non-English speaker,    My computer has given up the ghost    may lead them  to believe my computer is inhabited by a spirit of the deceased, rather  than that my computer is no longer functioning.        Carroll eloquently and humorously reflects the flaws in language and  the difficulties it presents through the fantastic and ridiculous.    Despite our differences and erroneous communications, Carroll unites the  human experience through the observations of the Cheshire Cat.   Perhaps  we really all are mad here.  ;"

Is wondering precisely what Shelley wanted me to wonder mean I'm a failure as an academic? Exploring a culture's subconscious through the fiction of the time is certainly fun, but within an individual work, does it really carry more weight than authorial intent?

Bethan, thank you for showing Banks' site - now I have plenty to read. I'm very sad about his death, 59 years is too short life for such person :(;Actually, intertextuality is a common practice if one studies Fairytales as a genre. Not only Rosetti and some other victorian writers practiced it, but also contemporary writers such as Angela Carter or A.S. Byatt.  ;That is such a useful reminder Joe -- I was thinking last night about lines from a poem by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht that carry associations of emerging from a dark and even monstrous primaeval place:I, Bertolt Brecht, came out of the black forests. My mother carried me into the cities while I lay Inside her body.  And the chill of the forests Will remain inside me until my dying day.Because as Sara Maitland notes when she explores the remnants of 12 British forests in Gossip from the Forest, these great dark   woodlands were home to   folklore characters like woodcutters, wolves, witches and   lost or feral children. I liked her retelling of fairytales too, the uncanny in a modern spin.The forest in many fairy tales is the   northern European forest of oak, pine and beech, filled with wild creatures and birds, hidden streams and   thickets, clearings with   old wells or   peasant cottages, the hiding place of robbers and bandits, a place   of secrets and   seasonal changes --   healing herbs and acorns or chestnuts for food, disorientating at night, hidden and dark, filled with shadows. It is also a place of transformation, with speaking animals, characters who are disguised or masked and not what they appear to be, roads that   lead   nowhere, paths that   offer danger and opportunity., untamed wilderness   A magical but threatening landscape -- and similar to mountains or lakes as places where   change takes place. or where worlds collide as an encounter between reality and   magic.;Good to find this thread -- I began working on a closer look at Rumpelstiltskin and   as I read more deeply and widely about the four older tales adapted and synthesised   into the   version published by the Grimm brothers, I   felt increasingly troubled by certain aspects. The miller's daughter agrees to give her   first-born   child to the   gnomish and cunning small man who   in return will   spin   straw into gold and save her life,   ensure her marriage to the king. She is in turn deceived and placed in impossible situations by her boasting father, her future husband and the   stranger who   appears to help her out.   Very typical of the   beautiful woman seen as helpless, unfortunate and depending on a rescuer of some kind. Why does this stranger want her child? A number of critics   commented on the widespread fear of   children or new-born infants being stolen, abducted, bought or lured away as having to do with Germanic   anti-Semitic   scare stories about Jews who would use the blood and   parts of the child's   body in obscene and devilish   rituals. Rumpelstiltskin was also often shown as a 'despicable dwarf' and prejudice against the disabled was widespread.When I was young I read and   enjoyed all these stories in a naive way and this course offers the opportunity to deconstruct   that naivety.   I'm glad of the critical awareness and shared discomfort   shown here   by other participants. Many of us   write and work in the   SF/F communities and   there is   still far too much   stereotyping in   fiction and uncritical appreciation of   writers like Burroughs, Lovecraft and others with attitudes that   need to be recognised as deeply offensive.;Ursula Le Guin's work is groundbreaking and   marvellously imaginative. In fact I don't think   I have ver found a particular emphasis on sex. Her slipperiness around gender was a unheard of at the time, long before Judith Butler. When I turned the page of a Le Guin novel and   read 'the king was pregnant' it felt as if I was entering another universe of possibility.;When I first read Bruno Bettelheim   s Uses of Enchantment, the   idea that the darkness and cruelty found in many fairytales and legends was in some way cathartic influenced my memories of   stories that had enthralled and   terrified me. Bettelheim suggested that fairy tale themes of abandonment, torture, violent death, witches, and grotesque   injuries gave children the opportunity to deal with deep-seated fears in a symbolic way. I   m no longer so sure about that and Betteheim   has been discredited in many ways as a theorist. At the same time, I   dislike reading    sanitised    or   tamed-down versions of   the fairytales I   heard and read as a child. The power of fairy tales is both   sinister and humorous,   dark and   hopeful by turns.  Reading through the   Household Stories this last week, I found myself wondering about traces   in them to do with histories of suppressed trauma. The     recurring preoccupations with food and shelter   may date back to times of famine or pestilence, the   mention of   soldiers or weapons to do with   European   feudal wars, the journeys undertaken may have to do with refugees   in flight or   homelessness after villages had been burned down or cities occupied by   foreign armies. The   vulnerability of orphaned children and young women is a persisting theme. Although the original   trauma may not be mentioned directly, I sometimes felt that some kind of tragedy, economic catastrophe or rape had triggered the   'story behind the story'.Freud   argued that    violent experiences are not registered consciously because  the subject does not have the psychic resources to process them,    which is why trauma is displaced, erased and   often only   found in traces or symbolic gestures that point back to what might have happened. The history of   northern Europe is a bloody and   unstable record from medieval times   through the   Renaissance and into the unification   struggles of the 19th century.    I   d like to hear if others have   wondered about this?  ;The issue of what children 'should' or 'shouldn't' read is a separate issue altogether. For most cultures you'd need a pedagogy that deconstructed   Hollywood appropriations before foisting Disney on children!Jen, I worked on Georg B _chner's   play Woyzeck (1837) a while back and that had a 'marchen' or 'fairy tale' that was   frightening and   eerie, a glimpse into the   underbelly of German militarism and working-class poverty, the anxiety of rapid social change across Europe at that time. But it's probably fair to say that throughout world history children from poorer families haven't been protected from the realities of   struggle, violence, danger.   A friend of mine in a   disadvantaged community school in South Africa   was telling us how the smaller children pretend to be boy soldiers in the Congo who   kill adults and   hide in the forest.   This might be the genesis for   a fairy tale or myth, a story that begins with play-acting to defuse fears.;Thanks for this link -- this is what I was hoping to find by enrolling in a MOOC for the first time this year.;I first encountered this   Victorian/Edwardian prurient fascination with small girls when I read the diaries of the Revd Francis Kilvert, a 19th-century vicar who   kept a diary while working on the Welsh Borders. The descriptions of landscape and   seasons were beautiful -- that nature writing the Victorians did so well. Kilvert was a young bachelor who married a   woman his own age and then died of peritonitis after his honeymoon.His interest in   little grils was creepy and fetishistic. He would beg them for kisses,   fondle them , spy on them   wait out for them and   stalk them ( in modern terms). His diariy entries refer frequently to 'caresses, loving looks, lap-sitting, and romps' with pre-pubescent girls. I doubt he   ever sexually molested them ( he may have been saving himself for marriage and   might have had a Christian respect for their virginity) but his infatuation with them was intensely amorous. and intrusive. His 'gaze' is always objectifying and possessive. He wanted to sketch them as   Lewis Carroll sought to   photograph them or   recreate them in literature. Kilvert was not ashamed of his passion for little girls but   exercised caution around   their hawk-eyed mothers. He preferred the company of children to that of adults.Very much like what we know of   Charles Dodgson. Like Dodgson, Kilvert found sexual innocence or purity to be erotic in itself. The Victorian idealisation of   young children centred on their   uncorrupt and   innocent beauty, their sweet obedient compliance with adult demands. The pedagogy of the   era was punitive and   conformist.   Few   parents or teachers had   any idea of a   child's right to any kind of autonomy or privacy. Children were whipped, starved, locked in rooms until they repented and 'behaved' themselves, sent away to boarding schools, threatened with   disinheritance if they did not satisfy their parents'   ambitions for them.   At the same time,   adults could relive their childhood feelings and   naughtiness   through play with children, a way of returning to   childhood Eden. Showing   physical affection to children was   more acceptable   than   touching, hugging or kissing   adult family members or   a woman to whom one was not formally engaged. Victorian society was an extremely repressed middle-class milieu with a thriving underworld of   brothels, adultery,   kept mistresses and pornographic fantasy. Other   Victorian public figures who showed the same   infatuated amatory interest in children included   Baden-Powell (his   encounters with his boy scouts make for quesy reading), JM Barrie, John Ruskin.How acceptable was this behaviour? I suspect many of their contemporaries   thought it immature, peculiar but not criminal.;I have read through and   evaluated three   essays on the first assignment and   all of them were more than 1 000 words in length, far in excess of the   word count given.Because this   is the first assignment, I am not penalising those who over-write but please   let's keep to the word count!It is inconsiderate to send in lengthy essays to evaluators who have five assignments to   read and   limited time. More importantly, it is unfair to those students who   made the effort to edit and cut their work down to   320 words or fewer. Those of us who work in media know it is much easier to write 2 000 words on a topic than 500 words or 200 words! Harder decision have to be made and   details have to be excluded.By writing   assignments of between 270 and 320 words,   we are learning to be concise and succinct in argument.;I checked the word counts each time by pasting them onto an MS Word program. You know, I don't want to discourage people who worked hard at   the first assignment and   this course is   done mostly for personal enrichment. So I didn't downgrade those who had exceeded the   word count. I also   didn't mark down those   struggling with written English.   In my home country we have many   students for whom English is their   second or third language, so we are able to   guide them skilfully following adult literacy principles. I   would like my evaluations to encourage those Coursera   participants for whom English is not their first language to   keep expressing themselves while pointing out some   of the more serious mistakes so they   can   learn from the essay feedback.The   evaluations are far more time-consuming   than I expected and   to read lengthy essays, correct   and explain language errors, and then comment on   the level of critical analysis will take several hours   each week. There should be a realistic   guide to this time-commitment   for those beginning   the course.

I find that layering mythic aspects into a   story resonates even when the symbolism isn't explicit. And often the associations come up quite naturally, echoes of   something we   read as a child or dreamed about. Our imaginations are mythopoeic.Have you read Angela Carter's fiction? She   has reinvented many   older fairytale elements and pushed imagery of the circus to   bawdy burlesque --   Jeanette Winterson does something similar in her fiction too. Then there's Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres -- I was well into the novel before I realised she was rewriting Shakespeare's King Lear and it   sent chills up my spine.   I am also thinking here of Iain Sinclair's psychogeography of   the London underworld.;Greg,   I see you write for a YA market, so consciousness of reader reception would be   uppermost. My notions of reader expectation or comprehension are   much vaguer! The   editor inhouse got my allusions and liked them, and that was good enough for me. I was writing about a character who goes on a potholing expedition in which an underground cave is discovered. There is a flash flood and someone drowns in the cave. A year later my character is recruited to lead a geological survey team to   the melted and exposed rocky territory undergoing development in the Antartic. She   realises she is being stalked by someone from the potholing group. Now the myth of Inanna has to do with Inanna being stripped down to psychic nothingness as she goes   down into the Underworld. Once there her sister   has her murdered and hung on a meat hook.   In my fiction, I used these elements of being stripped down -- losing torches, losing   contact, electronic   aids failing, losing a protective helmet, losing   the sense of direction and   even a sense of self. And in that increasing disorientation and darkness there is terrible violence that is also vengeance for a stupid   mistake that cost someone his life a year earlier. The imagery came to me   instinctively because I love the myth. Then I began weaving it into the fiction little by little. Some of it worked better than other aspects.[Sorry for such a long post -- I hadn't thought about that story in years!];I   signed up for this thread because of my interest in science fiction/fantasy and   so I have decided to look at the   symbolic Vorpal sword in Alice Through the Looking Glass for this week's assignment. There is so much   to explore in Lewis Carroll that I felt I could do an entire course on his work alone, but the Jabberwocky is a nonsense poem I   learned by heart years ago and   was intrigued by what a Vorpal sword might look like.  One, two! One, two! and through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.   Are there any other sf/f lovers who have wondered about this iconic sword?;Sean this is not just bloody brilliant, but BRILLIG!Dodgson/Carroll said   himself he had no idea how he arrived at the   term 'vorpal' and the word play has been done by scholars who like acrostics or   word games. Not altogether convincing. The   Vorpal sword is more neopagan or medieval fantasy   than gospel. The   word 'Vorpal' is perfect for a 21st-century post-Star Trek, post -Bradbury-Asimov-Le Guin understanding.What does Tweedledee say? 'If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.'Where does the Vorpal sword come from? The Mad Hatter tells Alice that it was stolen from the White Queen by the   Knave of Hearts, who comes across as an undiscriminating kleptomaniac who'll pinch anything of   sentimental or   real value. The White Queen safeguarded this massive unwieldy sword with its   notorious power of beheading.Where is the   sword now? Stashed away in the castle of the Red Queen who   has a fetish about beheading.What   does Alice have to do before she even begins to tackle the question of handling   the Vorpal sword? She has to   find the White Rabbit (that unpunctual mentor)   who will show her the way to a small building guarded by the Bandersnatch. Alice must retrieve the eye of the Bandersnatch, so she runs to find the dormouse who may still have the eye. (The eye here has an elusive quality not unlike the   smile of the   vanishing Cheshire cat.) Alice will have to cunningly steal the eye from Mollymkun and restore it to the Bandersnatch who will then   let Alice have the   Vorpal sword.The powers of the sword are limited. It has no mundane or useful uses, it would seem. Alice can't cut the bonds of the Mad Hatter and free him. She can only kill the Jabberwocky.The Jabberwocky as poem not monster has to be deciphered as a magical reverse text, the code to do with a   magical verbally concealed   Vorpal sword. Alice encounters chess piece characters. In an inverted world or back-to-front dreamscape, Alice   has to read the reflection   of the   baffling text as   mirror-writing. The Vorpal sword's origins may have to do with its ability to snicker-snack, relating to a large kniife known as a   snickersnee. The poem Jabberwocky comes out of language   that is carnival or burlesque and   singsong nonsense. The   poem Jabberwocky is an incantation, a way of   conjuring up a battle that will go on and on even though the Jabberwocky has been beheaded many times.Who is the Jabberwocky's true enemy?   ( This from Tim Burton's   imaginative film Alice in Wonderland.) the Jabberwocky confronts Alice in battle Alice, he quotes ""Ah, my  old foe. We meet on the battlefield once again."" When Alice states that  they have never met, the Jabberwocky says, ""Not you insignificant bearer. My  ancient enemy, the Vorpal One."";Well, so long as we footnote it, we can draw on popular culture too, Florence.

I don't   write much fiction -- most of my work is commissioned non-fiction, but I understand the genres I work with. I wouldn't say the myth made it easier but it did enrich my writing.There was something the   sci-fi writer   M John Harrison wrote   in   a Guardian review about the tension between the   Unconscious, irrational and creative material surging up and needing to be controlled by conscious intention that says a great deal to me about how some of us work. Images and metaphors appear and can be extended or deepened, so long they don't slow the pace or   distract from the narrative arc.;Hi William and thanks for the feedback. The key thing with writing fiction for me is that every element or   metaphor   needs a reason to be there and has to work hard to move the narrative forward. The symbolism should feel as if it belongs, occurs naturally. ;Good to hear from you Luisa -- so much to work with in African folklore, isn't there? I studied the griot traditions of West Africa (the novels of Chinua Achebe touch on these).;That sounds exciting Luisa -- you mentioned many of my favourite writers there.   I'll have a look at your website and leave   contact details.;Julieta, I was also fascinated by the different styles of communication -- diaries, letters, falsified letters, business letters,   cryptic notes, newspaper articles. And the speed and urgency astonished me for a Victorian   novel.Then there are the medical discourses and rituals of exorcism. So on the one hand there are those   largely undescribed blood transfusions (three hearty men giving their blood to Lucy) and   whacks of morphia prescribed. On the other hand there are   golden crucifixes, the sign of the cross being made, garlic garlands to repel vampires, a wooden stake through the heart and   beheading. Medicine works a little. Religious and   folkloric rituals work in extremis. And then there is the   treatment of   'madness' or 'lunacy', the   asylum and constraint. Oh and then the 'Just Married' lovers' discourse set in opposition to the irresistibly seductive and corrupt Count Dracula and his erotic vampirism. I can't get over how much   Stoker packed into   this novel and how   skilfully he brought such disparate elements together.;I hear you, Lauren. Most of   my post-grad work   dealt with Lacanian and   Kleinian (Object Relations) insights and   I'm used to post-Freudian studies, more to do with Judith Butler's Gender Trouble or   post-colonial deconstruction. A little   puzzled by the   uncritical approach to   textual analysis here.;  Really enjoying this thread. There are   layers of subtext here that intrigued me. Because the homoerotic content is unconscious and   possibly unintended by Stoker, it appears only indirectly and   for me it would seem to be coded as taboo or forbidden -- to   perform oral sex on a man or a woman would be forbidden, to drink or swallow ejaculate semen would be as   taboo as drinking blood, The 'little death', the swooning or fainting might be read as a trope for orgasm. There are the gothic undertones -- the religious extremism of   gesturing with crucifixes, the   quest for exorcism, the   superstitions of medieval   belief, the implied cannibalism of   consuming the   host as Body and Blood. The language of constraint -- women locked up in bedrooms, drugged unconscious, drained of vitality, the asylum, the   crazed craving for   torture, flirting with revulsion (rats and   flies), obsession with corpses, hints of necrophilia. If the reader wants to detect forbidden tropes or subtexts,   you need to read counter to the text, against the grain in many ways. If we look at the figure of Dracula, the   intense   relationship he has   with Jonathan Harker could be contrasted with the   hostile and   mercenary relationship he has   with the three female vampires. Jonathan belongs to him first and foremost, he will enjoy Jonathan before the   females can taste him. To counter   the corrupt Count, you find male bonding   between the men who are suitors for   the affections of   Mina. The men undergo another   kind of blood bonding via their transfusions under the tutelage of   Van Helsing. Lucy   is filled up with blood and revitalised   by each of three men in turn, they could all be her husband. Polymorphous and perverse! This is a   book that draws on Swinburne and anticipates the decadence of Wilde and Beardsley, or perhaps   Baudelaire and Rimbaud.   'The love that dare not speak its name' cloaked in   toying with bisexuality and   voyeuristic sadism shown towards the   sexual lust of   vampiric women. Nothing overt, but   we didn't have to wait until Anne Rice came along to find eroticism and taboo in   Dracula.;Yes, we're looking at pre-Freudian fiction here and   that is where the Unconscious has full play because although Stoker would have moved in a society brimming with hidden and   underground sexual modalities, none of this could be stated directly and he would not have set out to inscribe   what   would have shocked or repelled his readers. It is there though, the   lushness of description, the   play on gothic and perversity -- much more than   just homoerotic symbolism.;"

If anyone wants to read up further on this, I'd recommend Colm Toibin's The Master which is fictionalised but very close to what probably happened in Henry James' circle of friends, which had included Oscar Wilde and Andre Gide. James himself was seen as 'an eligible bachelor who showed no intention of marrying' and had several men friends who identified as 'inverts' or 'Uranians' until the Wilde scandal made it unsafe   for anyone to   associate with known homosexuals or show sympathy for Wilde. I imagine Stoker was forced deeper into that imprisoning closet along with many other men!One term or concept I find useful when   referring to the undercurrents found in   late Victorian literature is 'queer' because that carries connotations of not just   homosexuality but   the desire to experiment with forbidden identities and lifestyles. There's a new book out I've just ordered, Where Thy Dark Eye Glances: Queering Edgar Allen Poe edited by Steve Berman (Lethe Press, available from Amazon).;I agree about JG Ballard, not just Crash. I'd like to think that responses to essays would be open to   more revolutionary or subversive readings, but I'm not sure that is realistic.Under my study window I have a shelf of what I think of as subversive, transgressive or controversial fiction: Thomas Bernhard, Elfriede Jelinek, Michel Houllebecq, Robert A Heinlein, Georges Perec, Sylvia Molloy's En Breve Cartel, M John Harrison's Empty Space, Clarice Lispector,   the early Thomas Disch, Kathy Acker, Roberto Bolano's By Night in Chile. Just for starters!;Predictably Stranger in a Strange Land from Heinlein. Subversive is an odd word and many people have differing notions of what is disruptive or outrageous or transgressive.;Great stuff Sean, nothing like a feisty provocative essay to get the mind working! Lucy in Blooferland. Your reviewers lacked any sense of irony, which is always the risk with literature courses.Yes, yes, yes, I noted that damning reference to Ophelia (and remember that   Lucy's father was a sleepwalker, not a good omen), but what about the doppelganger or twinning of   Lucy and   Mina, the light and dark twins? Mina doesn't   flirt with three men and   accept transfusions from four, she instead asks herself:    What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days?    Lucy is Dionysian by night; Mina is chaste and   that   brings her respect from the   men around her, she   is able to think ahead because even when under the   hypnotic spell of Dracula's power, she   protects the men around her from any contamination, she   acknowledges her branding (Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter again).Once licentious Lucy the New Woman has died and   been ritually mutilated to ensure she loses   her Undead allure, the sexually reticent Mina comes into her own. Mina is Lucy with enough   prudence to avoid the   Fall. ;Right now I'm wrenching myself away from   Bram Stoker and   immersing myself   In Mary Shelley., but still fascinated by threads on   Carroll's Alice and Grimms' fairytales.   I can't wait to see what   the discussion threads will bring up next. Like many of us, I'm working extremely hard and having a great time. I don't know I'd have tackled this reading list on my own, and to read alongside so many smart and thought people is a huge plus.Yes, the peer reviewing is something of a lucky dip. My feeling is that   MOOCs are just getting off the ground and there is quite a steep learning curve underway. Not unlike   writing forums four or five years ago,   cluttered up with unskilful and unrealistic posters floundering, expecting overnight fame and   worrying about plagiarism.   Now there are a   number of published writers grateful for   the forums'   input of   agents, editors and   beta readers as well as stimulating conversations. A learning environment is the best place to make friends. And it would be such a pity to   complete a course like this without enjoying the process --;I'm participating -- I   write my weekly essays on themes or topics that fascinate or intrigue me and I hope will interest the reader,   then   sit lightly to the responses though I've had some   very perceptive comments.   I read carefully through essays written by others and spend   time giving feedback in evaluation. But the real engagement is with the books themselves and the discussion forums.;William, I agree, and   since you are an aspiring writer you'll find this   kind of   succinct writing exercise very helpful when it comes to sending synopses to publishers or writing 'pitches' for agents or just anticipating criticism of your written work.One   big issue with peer review is   learning to accept criticism from readers from many different backgrounds with   different expectations and   varying skills when it comes to reading. We all want an ideal reader, someone who 'gets' us the first time, someone   whom we think is 'qualified' to judge our work ( like a lecturer or professor). We want 'fairness', we want reasonableness, we want someone   just like us to read and   praise or encourage us. What we get is a mixed reaction that   pushes us to work out what is helpful and what   is not, how to disregard flattery and write more authentically, how to deal with rejection and keep working, keep taking risks and do the best we can because our own self-esteem as a writer or reader is not bound up with   acknowledgement from others. Invaluable stuff --;When I choose a topic, I focus on   a theme or   point of interest that   fascinates me and it is great to have the freedom to do so. But essay-writing is all about communication, so I try to make the theme or argument as lucid, contextual and interesting as possible for the reader.;Interesting post David -- although I do think Mary Shelley was not writing a romance but a novel in the gothic tradition and so the love interest was not as important to her. She was the daughter of a famous if impecunious   philosopher, William Godwin, and   her circle of friends and family   (including her   poet Husbnd percy and   Byron) had been discussing 'galvanism' which was a scientific or pseudo-scentific   notion of animating matter, drawing on old myths of Prometheus who fashioned   beings from clay   and the idea of the homunculus as well as the golem. We'd   call this kind of novel a 'novel of ideas' and that interests me in terms of scientific fiction because many science fiction novels are about the science of the future or ideas about society, about scientific discoveries that change society and the nature of relationships.;Yup, rather too much like life that way. We want a   scripted Hollywood   pace or   modern novel scenario, plotted for ease of reading -- and instead we   get   something that reminds us of life?Mary with tongue firmly in cheek.;Yes, a great quote and that   particular maturity of   Mary Shelley is   very much of her time. I've been working on an essay to do with the metaphor of   childbirth, the images of gestation, miscarriage, labour, stillbirth -- the many   conflicting and fertile aspects of creating a novel like Frankenstein -- and,   of course, this 18-year-old woman, unmothered and   who had grown up with an impecunious philosopher father had been through so much already. She was recovering from   childbirth and her baby daughter had died. She was   pregnant again and afraid she would not deliver a healthy normal   child, even as she wrote about   creating a monster. Her beloved half-sister Fanny had recently   killed herself and so had her husband Percy's ex-wife Harriet. All around her was uncertainty, grief and   new possibilities,   the excitement of creativity, the risks of leading such an unconventional   bohemian life in Geneva (she had run away with her poet at the age of 16 and her father had disowned her).And all of this dangerous knowledge and   the risks of travelling far from the security of her hometown would go into   her   novel.;I find this thread interesting -- would an artificial being   always be monstrous because he or she is not human? It isn't just being large, or out of proportion or threatening in   appearance,   it is   an unsightliness that marks the creature as Other., as not one of us and   unable to belong with us. The fear that he will mate and reproduce his own kind is why Frankenstein destroys the unfinished   female   creature. Humans cannot live with the inhuman.The paradox of course in that the   monster is one of the most   human creations in the book, he has pathos and yearnings and   his loneliness is akin to our own. Asimov's thinking desiring robots owe a great deal to Frankenstein's monster.;Thanks for this William -- fascinating perspective;"

That essay sounds fantastic.;And I'm very   pleased I did push you Sean -- onanistic creative surges indeed! Seriously, this makes for a thought-provoking read and I liked the way you put   the quotes in the referemces to give yourself more space for your argument.There's no guarantee here that any of us will   get   even three or even two peer reviewers who are on our wavelength, creative, adventurous, erudite, etc. These essays though offer an open-ended opportunity to push the envelope for ourselves, to stretch ourselves and test   hypotheses for our own satisfaction. The discussion forum threads are a much better guide to   topics and cutting-edge ideas than the format suggests. It isn't about learning to   dot the 'i's and cross the 't's for academic referencing. Nobody in their right minds is going to take a marking system   done in an   ad hoc fashion by unscreened and unsupervised peer reviewers to be on a par with accredited academic pass rates.

In this story Hawthorne sounds very like the early   Henry James whose   work I love with a passion.;It makes me sheepish to admit this, but I came to sci-fi very late. When I was doing O-levels we   had a collection of science fiction stories and the English teacher   dismissed them as a novelty, not serious literature like DH Lawrence or Hemingway. I   remember most of the sci-fi plots to this day and there was a   Bradbury story there. I loved John Wyndham's Day of the Triffids and the Midwich Cuckoos but couldn't really   understand Asimov or Brian Aldiss. And then I was in my 30s and in bed with flu and   found myself given Ursula Le Guin, Joanna Russ, Kim Stanley Robinson and I   hated them. Felt   baffled and couldn't   work out what   and why these writers were doing this kind of thing.One night I was travelling on business and   unable to sleep in my hotel room so I watched a   klutzy BBC mockumentary on a city under a dome on Mars, walkways and artificial pools, theme parks, shopping malls, and my blood ran cold. I lay awake all night making up a story about a society of Mars dwellers trapped in a kind of condo paradise, no children being born, no way to tell the time (all clocks banned), days of shopping and   aimlessness. A custom-designed society in stasis that is suddenly invaded by   feral drug-crazed teenagers in stolen space ships.And   after that I was ready for the mind-bending fantasies of sci fi.;Inspiring thread, thanks Megan.When I'm   reading the   fiction texts, I jot down lines that strike me and my   reactions to certain themes or   characters. Then I   think about what   upset, or amused, or   moved me. A theme for an essay emerges and I take a   large blank sheet of note paper and   doodle around, images of tiny hands, coffins,   ineptly drawn roses. A design for a stop-watch. I look at what puzzled me, at what resonates,   list words and phrases that keep coming back to me. I sometimes do some extra reading, think about the lives of Hawthorne and Poe. Think about the   time and place in which they wrote.Then I go away for a day or a few hours and   come back and see what has coalesced, what is glowing for me. Has a new theme   been born on the page?   I draft out   a few paragraphs and   submit in case my   computer crashes and I   never get another chance to   submit. Later I come back and   look at what niggles me.   I rewrite and   restructure. I   look at   my last line, how to sum things up or leave things dangling. I listen to some classical music and   then Appalachian Spring. Some jazz.   Coltrane, nothing too attention-grabbing. (I listen to music in between bouts of writing, prefer to   write in silence.) I sit in the bath and   wonder   what I would boldly write if I had to   bring my not-quite-finished essay to life and give it pizzazz.I sit down and   do my references or footnotes. I give my essay pizzazz so that it   stretches its new wings and flies around the room a little. I murder a few darlings with a small axe, lose a   favourite sentence that   sounds a little too precious or obscure. I make some green tea and   imagine that I am a friendly stranger sitting alone in a   quiet apartment reading this essay. What might NOT make sense? I   murder another 'cute-sounding' phrase.

I know the pain of the latter problem, because I used to be that way, too.I don't know if this will be helpful for you or not, but I'm going to try something I've never done before vis-a-vis essay writing, inspired by Dr. Rabkin's examples - I'm going to take down my bulletpoints *as* I read, and then when I'm finished with the book, I'll have a list to cull and expand on. That way, I won't get stuck by being too literal (as often happened to me when I was struggling to fill the page), but I also won't be tempted to throw every possible theme and plot point at the wall in an orgy of self-satisfied personal discovery.At least, that's the theory.

This time around though, technology has made taking notes significantly less physically difficult, so I have a better chance of remembering to tap things out along the way.And in case anyone needs it, here's one of my favorite quotations from Aaron Sorkin, one of the greatest writers in film and television still alive today:     I love writing, but hate starting. The page is awfully white and it says, 'You may have fooled some of the people, some of the time, but those days are over, Giftless. I'm not your agent and I'm not your mommy: I'm a white piece of paper. You wanna dance with me?' and I really, really don't. I'll go peaceable-like.   I love that quote because it illustrates that those first panicked moments when you feel like you have nothing substantial to say and can't possibly fill the blank space with anything meaningful afflict even the most celebrated of writers.;Hola!

But I still break out in a cold sweat when I think about doing literary essays. I can write the heck out of any other kind - historical, sociological, scientific, whatever, but literary essays - ack. I remember angrily telling my mother that university was an upperclass game this working class kid didn't know how to play, because when I asked my professors what they expected, the answer was ""you're in college now, you need to figure that out yourself."" To which my mental reply was, ""I'm paying $20k a year and you won't even tell me the rules?!"" Like you, age and experience has taught me that the problem was *those particular professors* (who, I don't think it's a stretch to say, looked at what was then a 16 year old kid in a wheelchair who was only able to attend thanks to scholarships, decided I didn't belong there, and did their best to make me feel unwelcome) - not my scholastic ability. I now know that if I ever attend a school where the answer to ""can you please clarify the parameters of this assignment?"" is ""figure it out yourself,"" I am at the *wrong* school for me and need to get out of there! At 16, I just didn't have that kind of self-confidence.I, too, am loving the clear expectations here. I don't need or want to have my hand held, especially vis-a-vis writing of any kind... but I *do* need to know what kind of a goal I'm shooting for, and I think Prof. Rabkin has set that up beautifully.I'm reading once for pleasure and bullet points, a second time for more detailed notes with Dracula, The Left Hand of Darkness and Little Brother, because those are the ones I've never read before and I have the good fortune to be a very quick reader - the others are both shorter and not new to me, so I'm hoping to dive right in with more detailed notes from the start. I already devoured Little Brother in an hour last night (how have I not read any Cory Doctorow before now? He reminds me of Vonnegut, one of my favorite writers of all time), so I'm hoping my ""pleasure"" reads of the others will go similarly.My ""critical reading"" glasses are still a little dusty, but I think Prof. Rabkin has set us all up for success - that's becoming a familiar feeling with Coursera courses, something I never had at my brick and mortar uni!;As a writer, I can absolutely agree with the blank page fear that occurs when you try to start writing something new. Whether it is in electronic form or traditional pen and paper, the white page is an enemy to be slain. I have a tendency to over-write in my beginning process just to get rid of the vast openness of a new page. I will doodle or freewrite or outline, whatever I have to do to feel more secure and safe from the scary first step. It often times ends up looking like a disastrous mess, but it is something! I find that, especially when typing rather than handwriting, just typing as much as you can as an initial thought is very relieving. It is much easier in a word processor than on paper because you can toggle where you want to write next, be it in the middle or at the beginning or in place of something less worthy. Eventually you can shape your jumbled mess of thoughts into something far more gratifying.  ;Although I agree with many of the different views here, my primary concern is that I don't want to risk 'programming' my own way of thinking about a book. I think of it in terms of classical program music; if you are told what the music is supposed to represent, your experience is guided and it becomes more difficult to come up with your own ideas. Like Megan, I will await a response to this question before doing any background reading. I might even avoid reading introductions in the books themselves as I have learnt from experience that sometimes they contain spoilers! :o);Thanks for this, I'll try it out on Thursday.;Oops.

That brought up a window to fill in the details.;o: I'm also working in South Korea,  but I'm originally from New York.;Greetings all,Per the syllabus, here is the link to the translation of the Brothers Grimm ""Children's and Household Tales"" by Lucy Crane. On that website there are several formats available, such as PDF, ePub and MOBI. ePub will work on almost all eBook readers. MOBI will work on a Kindle. There is also an HTML and plain text version, both of which can be read on a computer if you do not have an eBook reader.I had a similar question about the selected readings for this unit, but I believe the selected readings are actually all of the tales in this translation (not just some of them). If this is incorrect, please feel free to update my understanding.  Happy reading, and I look forward to more interaction here in the forum as well as in our peer reviews.;I'd argue that science fiction, like all literature, is evolving. Authors like China Mieville (who just happens to be on the tip of my brain at the moment....) are taking the concept of science fiction to interesting places. For me, science fiction's appeal lies in its ability to examine how people are/could be given the addition or removal of technology. The ""weird fiction"" catalogue fascinates me.... While some sci-fi holds over time, much doesn't. I've been pondering what gives ""staying power"" and what dates.... My current thought is that the author's ability to tell a story that reveals an aspect of humanity is what makes excellent science fiction... Regardless of where Real life science has taken us.... So awesome sci-fi continues to be born..... Just my two cents...... ;Since I'm only 14, my argument might have a lot of holes in it and can be easily crushed, but I agree with Matthew. If you take something like Star Wars, which can be technically be called science fiction, and an episode from the ninth,  tenth or  doctor in television series Doctor Who, one can clearly see the difference. While Star Wars has many elements that can't be directly explained by science, like the force and hyper speed, the tenth doctor explains werewolves as alien parasites, robotic men as being a type of vessel of immortality, and  zombies as being an accident concerning medical nanobots, which  are fantastical elements that can be explained with theoretical science. In conclusion, the genre of science fiction has indeed evolved to rely less on completely fantastical elements. Casey and Matthew,  feel free to correct me.;My favorite Sci-Fi author has always been Philip K. Dick, and largely that's because of the reasons he has for using technological explanations for things he can't actually do. He often describes technology that we actually have today, but didn't when he wrote of it originally. He was a paranoid schizophrenic at the very least, and had to be able to explain not just (Fantasy) that ""they are monitoring him,"" but rather (Sci-Fi) how they are monitoring him. If you remove the technology from his stories, they don't revert to being some sort of Fantasy story, but instead they fall apart completely - the Technology is a character, and needs to be built just like every other character.As far as the Pern books, those seem almost like they'd be right at home in both Sci-Fi and Fantasy. If you remove the technology, the stories don't fall apart but they are no longer the same stories. Pern without technology and science becomes something more similar to Xanth, where everything simply is.I feel like the major difference is similar in nature to the argument between Science and Religion (entirely over-simplified, anyway) with one explanation trying to say exactly how everything was done, and understand it; the other to look at it with awe and wonder. Sometimes, telling a story without explaining the impossible events pushes the story along, and I'd think of a story like that as being Fantasy.When it's all said and done, the two genres definitely have some overlapping room. I would imagine that's why this class seeks to study both.;I think exactly like you about that ""uncanny valley"" feeling because of the fast science and technological progress. What I think has happened to SF is that it has become more difficult to write when focusing on tech and ""action"" more than philosophy and character struggles. I find Neuromancer's ending every bit as appealing now than 10 or 20 years ago, the CODA is just filled with bitterness, but I think that TV and movies SF has been obeying to Hollywod standarsd (mostly) which ends up offering lame remakes of the same ideas.SF's real challenge is to begin dreaming again of the (for HIMYM fans) possimpable. I mean, SF dreamt so much time with many of the things that we have now, or see in the near future, that we need to, once again, propose the ""ridiculous"" stuff that will question our very own humanity as many authors have done (Gibson and Card are some contemporary examples of this done effectively IMHO).What do you think?;I lament that I can only read English, because it definitely hinders my ability to have a wide-range of source material to build my notions from ...;Karen, yes, I do! :) Pester away. Be warned that I know little about the actual coursera site, though - I'm more a hardware/software/OS/accessibility tech geek than a coding/website geek, so any queries about the platform itself are best directed to the appropriate board. While I'm here, the best free screenreader of anything you might pull up in a *browser* that I've found is Chromevox, located here: http://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/It's a browser extension for the Chrome browser, so it's got a fairly small footprint and does a decent job. Unfortunately, it doesn't help with navigating your actual operating system, so anything *outside* of your browser (switching tabs, opening programs, using a word processing document etc) won't be voiced.Similarly, there is a Firefox plugin that has the same benefits (and caveats): http://firevox.clcworld.net/Macs have a program included in the Mac OS itself called VoiceOver, which is far and away the best screenreader that one can have outside of JAWS - it reads anything on the web as well as anything else you're doing on your computer.Windows has a free OS based screenreader too, but it must be downloaded separately, and which screenreading extension to download depends on which version of Windows you're running. Some of them are better than others. None are great.There are tons of screenreaders for Linux, but I don't use Linux, so I'd have to ask my buddy who does for his recommendations.Hope that helps anyone who might need such info.;I suggest you look into Audible for future reference.   It's an Amazon company that offers audio-books for a subscription.   I've downloaded the Android app, but I haven't actually used it yet.From what I saw this evening, I don't think it would be cost-effective for you for this class, as it limits subscribers to 1 book per month.   I looked up Frankenstein and one of the other novels for this class, one was $20 and the other $25 to purchase for immediate use.   I would not choose to drop ~$200 to read books for one free class.;Hi guys! Will we be using the course wiki? How does it work?Thanks;I think you have a great thesis. I haven't paid attention on social statuses while reading the tales because my mind was focused on some other stuff, such as step-mothers and why they are always evil. But what you say obviously seems true and I think you should definitely write about the social status of men.;Thanks for the resource. I actually just wanted to share my thoughts. I'm only now working on the actual essay. But your input has been really helpful.  ;You were actually more helpful than you think. ;);I wanted to pick up on Karen's thought about ""luck"".   I had a professor who showed us the difference between the concept of ""fortune"" in Medieval times versus the concept of ""fortune"" in the Renaissance Era. These stories   are essentiallly Medieval folklore but were complied by the brotheres Grimm in the early ninteenth century. The medieval concept of ""fortune"" is a ""spinning wheel"" and mankind has little influence on their own fate. The Rennaissance concept of fortune, thanks to Machiavelli's The Prince, was that man could make his own fortune and could, to some extent, control his own destiny. I certainly see the medieval ""spinning wheel of fortune"" at work in most of the stories. Just a thought I wanted to add since Karen brought it up.;I agree with you, my mind was going in the same kind of direction.I haven't read all the stories yet, but I've noticed how the message seems to be in some of them: if you want to outstand a noble/king while you're of lower birth, you'll have to be smart.I can take the examples that stricked me so far:- ""The Rabbit's Bride"" - I feel that the Rabbit is the representation of the Lord who takes a part of what his farmers produce and can take a lower born girl if he wants. The girl sacrifize herself to save the garden, but gets away with a clever idea.- ""Six soldiers of fortune"" - The 6 soldiers punish the evil king by joining their very peculiar forces. Being written after the French and American Revolution, I wonder if there's a linked message of the power of the People over a king if he's not good enough???- ""Clever Grethel"" - obviously gets away from his master by a clever twist ;-);I tend to distinguish Science Fiction from Fantasy based on whether it deals more with technology, or more with magic.   So if you like role-playing games, I would classify Shadowrun as Fantasy due to the magical elements, even though it also includes a Cyberpunk / high-technology world.Of course, the quote ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is virtually indistinguishable from magic"" is relevant, and allows the issue to be confused.   I've seen convincing arguments that Star Wars is more fantasy than science fiction, both because of the Force and the strong Jungian archetypal themes.So I think that Utopian and Dystopian novels could be either SF or Fantasy.Are you familiar with S.M. Stirling's Emberverse?   It begins with more of a Science Fiction flavor, and in fact the Nantucket side of the story (""Island in the Sea of Time"" and sequels) continues with a historical fiction / science-fiction time travel flair.However, the United States / Washington State side (""Dies the Fire and sequels) of S.M. Stirling's story quickly becomes dystopian in the first few books.   I still think of the first set as Science Fiction, as it often deals with the technology of survival.   But by the second set of books, the story has become high fantasy, echoing old legends.Eric Flint's ""Ring of Fire"" series is another time-travel / historical fiction, that includes significant discussion of technology.   Even the act of displacing the town in time is explained as alien technology, not ""magic"".   Therefore, I would classify it as science fiction.   But I think I've digressed, since I don't think this series is particularly utopian yet (nor dystopian, but these stories lean hopeful, pointing toward an eventual utopian future).I would classify LeVar Burton's dystopian novel as science fiction, since it deals with technology and a near-future time.   But ""Elementals"", by Morgan Llewellyn, I'd call fantasy.Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.;The boundaries in writing tend to be fairly fluid in my opinion, especially the further you get from fact and into the realms of the fantastical.   Genres are not so much boxes that contain and limit  as they are  puddles, reaching out and melting across attempts to  define borders.  Sci-fi/fantasy is particularly good at this because it's a built-in mechanism, anything is possible from imagining King Arthur  returning to save England in WW2, to  Joss Whedon's Buffy and Firefly series. One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently ""lost"".   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as ""science"" ie ""matrix technology""  with ""technicians"" and ""monitors"".   When they are ""rediscovered"" by the more traditionally  technology-dependent Terrans of the original Earth, tensions ensue around multiple issues, including the consequences and ethics  of embracing certain advances.   For example, ""blasters"" are  banned by Darkover  as they  confer a greatly enhanced advantage to only one opponent; by using bladed articles only, each combatant must place him/herself in danger of injury or death, therefore meeting on equal ground.   With regards to medicine, yes, Terran practices can do wonderful things, such as improved  hygiene and the dispelling of harmful superstitions; but a midwife points out the downside  could include  a newborn with a heart defect who survives through such intervention will require greater care through life, and even pass on the defect to its offspring, requiring yet further intervention; widen that to the population as a whole, and the difficulties become swiftly apparent.   These questions also apply to the Darkovans.   Crucially, their  ""matrix technology"" is itself  linked to biology;  ""laran"" as it is called, is a genetic trait, with a physical presence in the  brain; and their society continues to  suffer from previous generations' attempts to  control and develop ever stronger talents through human breeding programmes which of went horribly wrong.      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the ""real world"",  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Right, that's my two cents!   :);Sounds like I will have to check out this ""Darkover"" series...thanks Christie!;Though the barrier between ""genre"" literature and mainstream literature is vague, it can never completely disappear. The best sci-fi and fantasy might be chosen by time and promote as the classic ones while the others are left behind and forgotten by the readers. There are some fantasy novels influencing the mass medias significantly now, but I don't think it means that these books are the first rank. The meaning of the distinction between ""genre"" books and mainstream literature is obvious, which is to pick the best ones and discard the mediocre ones no matter whether they are sci-fi and fantasy or not.  ;Wow. I didn't expect to get so many answers with so many good recommendations.  @Karren Abbott I've recently started reading The Hunger Games. I am on the last book, actually. I avoided them for a long time because YA books get popular and then you read them and they're awful. But I was very surprised by these books. Totally not what I was expecting. I thought the movie was really awful though. The thing I find interesting about them, maybe I'm alone here, but they're subdued. You know all these terrible things are going and you keep thinking ""Just defy the Capitol! GO!"" and you know they are but at the same time it's like you're slowly creeping around the corner to get that monster and it's just so calm about it. Maybe it's just me but I just got this subdued sense of urgency from the books.  I know it's not a book but has anyone seen THX 1138? It was a student film George Lucas did back in 1971. It's actually pretty good.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138;Thank you for the essay. I know you haven't read it but they do get into the PTSD in the second book. A lot of the kids don't actually go and kill anyone. A lot hide and just get killed. Very few actively kill. They actually bring this up in the second book (I read the first part of the essay. I'll have to read the whole thing when I have time, so I don't know what all they're saying in the essay). SPOILERS AHEAD: In the 75th Hunger Games, it's called the Quell and they do something ""special"". Well, that year they draw from the pool of victors in each District. One of them remarks to Katniss that they all wouldn't be here if they didn't have a killer instinct. Basically that not that many people would/could actually kill when they're put into the situation. That we're not all like that. That's one point I have a problem with straight out that the essay says.  They actually mention a girl who won simply by hiding for the whole games. She never killed anyone. Also, at the beginning of the games, there's this place that they all start out in and they're in a circle around it and at the center is weapons, food, medicine etc. But the catch is, all the strong, well trained ones go for it. So, you can risk your life or head for the hills. Generally around 11-13 people die in the first few minutes. Only the strong or afraid survive.  Sorry, I really like these books and I think they make a lot of good discussion points, whether you agree or not.  ;It is true, Rebecca, that fairy tales have simple narrative structures, as do comic books, TV series and serial novels. These structures make them easy to follow   and probably made them easy to remember and enrich when they were part of the oral tradition.  But doesn't their main attraction lie in the wondrous and magical worlds they portray? ;I've been thinking this over for several days, and I'm not sure how clearly I can articulate this thought yet, so pardon any rambling.I do not enjoy Grimm, and I never have; not even the sanitized versions. However, I *do* get that comforting dopamine rush when reading (or hearing, or reciting) an *Irish* fairy tale - and I'm not sure why that is. I grew up on Grimm and Irish tales in equal measure, so it's not that one holds more nostalgia over the other. The Irish archetypes are not that different from Grimm; threes are prominent, so is nature, the same class issues abound, and on and on. But for some reason, when I *think* fairy tale, I think Cuchulainn, or Fionn MacCumhail and Benandonner, or the Salmon of Knowledge, or The Children of Lir... but if I pick them apart, they hold the same kind of morals and the same general take away messages as the Grimm tales do. I suppose on the most simplistic level, I find Irish fairy tales more interesting or more enjoyable... but I can't even deconstruct why *that* is.I am almost afraid to think about it too much, lest I get distracted from what we're *supposed* to be writing about... I'd much rather deconstruct the Irish ones!;Hitler came much later than the Grimms and German nationalism, so you might need to revisit that hypothesis.   Remember, 'Deutschland ueber alles' meant 'Germany as a whole comes before Schleswig-Holstein' before it meant 'Germany conquers the world'.;It may be partly about the memory of being read to. Read these tales aloud to someone else, and they take on an entirely different quality. There's something very dreamlike about them, some mapping onto the unconscious even when we're annoyed by the amoral or malicious character coming out on top, or a repetition of ridiculously rigid gender roles, or the apparent lack of logic.;I would offer another perspective. We love these stories, in a way that we don't (some could say can't) love other stories. If for no other reason than these were given us at developing periods prior to critical analysis, of both literature and our world in general. They speak to us because they have become archetypal and fundamental. On a quick aside, I once heard a literary anarchist (I forget the fellow's name) in Berkeley who spoke of the pagan roots of Disney's versions of the stories, he said that Disney was the most counter-cultural icon in the 20th century namely because he got 'Christians' to love old pagan tales...an argument could be made in many regards his assertion (for instance the initial artwork added Christian images), but I've always found the idea compelling (much in line with JK Rowling's, Potter series as well).;"
TRUE,St113,Coh1,2,0,0,1,0.0560697,0.976228421,0.75,0,0.375,0.2595717,0,"I had the opposite experience.As a kid, I would read the SF&F shelves in the children's section of the library (aka, the YA section).   As I approached adolescence and found I had read most of the books on the shelves, that's when I started drifting to the adult SF section.Unfortunately, one of my favorite YA SF writers was Robert Heinlein.   I quickly learned that his adult books were, well, adult.   I was a lot more cautious in the adult section after that, but I did go back.As we moved around, I made a point to check both sections.;Re: The Handmaid's Tale genre, you make a good point.I'm reminded of another distinction that I often use for SF and Fantasy:SF usually / often occurs in the future, when space travel goes between star systems, or on alien worlds.Fantasy often occurs either in the past, other universes, or on worlds where the technology level is approximately Earth-medieval, and the astronomy of star systems / constellations are not relevant.Of course it's not as clear as all of that.   Anne (& also Todd)   McCaffrey's PERN novels are a hybrid - Dragon's Dawn and similar first-pass stories I would call SF.   The Lessa & F'lar stories begin as Fantasy but with the discovery of AIVAS become more SF.   Most of the stories in between those two poles (Nerilka's Story, Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, much of Todd's co-authored books, Moreta, etc.) I would classify as more Fantasy, because they deal with dragons and a medieval-tech world.Honestly, I always considered Speculative Fiction to be a meta-category, one that includes SF, Fantasy, Horror, Historical Fiction, some Mystery novels, and probably other categories I haven't thought of.;I am in the same boat. I think I am seeing the end of the tunnel and then an avalanche of books happens. Not a bad thing though. Honestly, I had been against reading them since they came out. I read the first one on the recommendation of a trusted friend who also had the hangs up about PR and what not. I devoured the first book in a day and it brought up so many points, at least to me, that I just kept talking to people about it. There's definitely more to the story.  ;I would agree with Rebecca - your comment is very insightful! I don't think that when the Grimm Brothers were writing they were only focused on one particular point - morality or trickster (while I think your recognition of the fact that the tales are composed of many genres helpful!).   When I read the tales I get the overall sense of a fantastical commentary on humanity, the times in which they lived and the societal realities in which they inhabited. In reading the Six Soldiers, one of the main themes appears to be that in order to get justice from an unjust King - authority figure - the common and honourable man (the soldier committed his duties well according to the beginning of the story) must band together in order to successfully receive what was due him (the gold at the end which was split between the men can be seen as the well earned retirement of the leader).   Thus, that tale can be read as social commentary on the hierarchal realities of that time. While others - such as Aschenputel, extol virtues that were considered important and are more reminiscent of a morality tale, and still others like the Rabbit's Bride are more reminiscent of warnings, or recognition of dangers which existed for women and girls at that point in time.  ;Karen, yes, it's an interesting notion, to be sure. As you say, Germany struggled with (and I think in some respects still struggles with) the concept of national identity - funnily enough, if you speak to modern day Germans about this, a lot of them will tell you their national identity is at least partly board games. A quick diversion to explain why this is so, and why it's a legacy Germans rightly rally around - after WWII, Germany banned any games pertaining to war, for obvious reasons. While the US and other countries designed and refined games like Risk, German boardgame companies were forced to turn to non-combat topics, and quickly discovered that no one else was making *strategy* games. In addition to that, no one else was making games that could be enjoyed in equal measure by the whole family. (Monopoly is not a strategy game - the only strategy is ""buy everything you land on"" - and is not accessible to children who don't know how to read, for example.) Germany got *on* this problem, and created an entire *industry* of strategy games that can be played and enjoyed by anyone old enough not to eat the pieces, using the same rules for your 5 year old as your 95 year old grandmother. The games tend to be identifiable by having interesting choices to make on your turn, dynamic setup (so the board is different each time), little to no randomness, and themes ranging from farming to history to travel to building a coral reef. They're now called ""Eurogames"" or ""German games,"" because in Germany, boardgaming is a massively popular family activity. The largest boardgaming festival/release party is in Essen every year, and it's a worldwide, bring-your-family-and-play-games event. The biggest and most coveted award for a boardgame is to be named the Spiel de Jahres - Game of the Year in Germany. Even American-designed board games fight for that distinction, because if you land on the list, your game will sell out, in Germany and often across Europe (sometimes in America, too - that happened with Settlers of Catan, a German game, and Dominion, an American strategy card game, when they got the SdJ.) So, if you ask a German what it means to be German, many of them will say, ""we make excellent games!"" And they're right!As you point out, while the Germans struggled to find ""safe"" ways to celebrate being German, the Irish struggled to be recognized as Irish at all. I'm positive that influenced the development (or stagnant nature) of their tales. How much is historical and how much is cultural, I think it's probably impossible to tease out. (I realize that's the point you were making, so I'm not insinuating that you were making any kind of a declarative statement there.) I'm inclined to think that culture provided the natural momentum in either direction, which was then aided by history... but without being able to travel back in time to the late 1700s/early 1800s, I doubt we'll ever know. There's only so much scholarly research can answer that question, I think, due to the passage of time, the near-annihilation of the Irish language, collapsing and reforming governments, An Gorta M _r, etc. Ironically, the historical *upheaval* in both countries is probably the biggest factor in our inability to definitively answer the question we're pondering!;Re: WWII and its effect on the UK vs. Germany - wow, I'd never thought about it that way before, but I'd bet you're right! I think the effects of WWII are sorely underestimated by Americans due to the way we're taught about it in school. It's very much presented as ""Hitler did some bad stuff, but how were we to know what he was really up to, it wasn't really our problem, but then the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and *then* the war started."" Typical arrogant Yank stuff, I know! But I was usually the only one with my hand up going ""Er... the Brits were getting the living daylights bombed out of them. Roosevelt made his big ""you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose"" speech regarding the Lend-Lease Act in 1940*, so are we to infer from this that it was in fact Congress being a bunch of feckless thugs during the year that elapsed between that speech and us actually getting involved (that is, business as usual for that branch of government), or was FDR receiving political pressure from an outside source?""That usually got me a ""see me after class.""   What can I say... I'm an American from the Irish diaspora, and the combination makes me disinclined to accept anything that smells like bull pucky. I am also probably still legend at my former uni for the only class in my life I ever walked out of, wherein a history professor announced a unit on ""The Famine,"" accepted my offer of a variety of source texts she had never seen (half and half, Irish and British, but all much better than the revisionist ""The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes"" crap in most American texts), and then, months later and having thanked me profusely for lending her said texts and allowing her to mark them up, promptly began the unit with ""The Irish were too stupid to eat or grow anything but potatoes. Here, let's laugh at political cartoons depicting them as flea-ridden monkeys!""Me: ""Er... are we going to discuss political satire in the 1840s and 50s and talk about where it came from and what the effects were on the various immigrant groups and persons of color it satirized? Possibly even tying that into the immigration debates of today?""""No, I just think they're funny."" (In fairness, those weren't her exact words, but it was certainly the gist!)I can't even remember exactly what I said, but it was lengthy and remarkably clean considering how much red I was seeing.Anyway, yes, I'm sure you're right about WWII being a huge causative factor in the sharp cultural division regarding the virtues of redemptive violence and the depiction of it in play. Makes perfect sense to me. And it makes me want to dig through all the modern retellings of fairy tales I know and see if I can spot the more recent evolutions!For myself, I'd rather have a copy of Agricola than a model Spitfire, but then, no one can fault the British for their heroism in WWII, so I can see the appeal of model Spitfires, too. :)* You probably know this quotation well - most non-Americans I know have a far more comprehensive knowledge of WWII than Americans do - but for anyone interested, the full ""you don't haggle over the price of your garden hose"" Roosevelt quote I would refer to in these discussions, which concerned to what degree and in what form the US should help Britain during the war, goes like this: ""Suppose my neighbor's home catches fire, and I have a length of garden hose four or five hundred feet away. If he can take my garden hose and connect it up with his hydrant, I may help him to put out his fire. Now, what do I do? I don't say to him before that operation, ""Neighbor, my garden hose cost me $15; you have to pay me $15 for it."" What is the transaction that goes on? I don't want $15--I just want my garden hose back after the fire is over."" - Franklin D. Roosevelt, Press Conference, December 17, 1940 (in the middle of the London Blitz, and almost a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor).;The glossing over of WWII was (and is) a systemic failure of the US public (free, government run) school system - not till I was taking uni-level US History in my last year before uni did I have a teacher who was *allowed* to contradict the texts. Most public school textbooks are printed by one of three companies in Texas, and they all spout the same inaccuracies, which the teacher is not allowed to contradict unless a student raises the point first. (Then it's ""class discussion,"" otherwise it's ""against the AKS,"" a manual that dictates what students will learn each year, and thus what teachers must teach, and how they're allowed to teach it) Fortunately I had a mother who was a history buff and a little bit of private school under my belt, so I was usually the one going ""Sir, wait a minute, what about...?"" Private schools tend to use a much broader range of source texts, so there's a little less indoctrination going on - apart from ""Bible based"" private schools, which is where all the creationism madness and the like comes from.The ""Irish people are flearidden monkeys"" thing was an incident at a fairly prestigious private university in the Southeastern US in 1998, and the kicker - the professor in question was ""proudly Irish"" (by which she meant Irish-American) and kept going on about how much she and I had in common (I'm also Irish-American of course, but I still have relations and friends there, and was raised more in the ex-pat community than any other, so *my* idea of what it means to be Irish-American and *her* idea of what it meant to be Irish-American were two very different animals! Don't get me started on the horrors of St. Patrick's Day in this heathen country...).But yes, it's all true.Re: ""What people believe about the past is more important than what did happen"" - sadly, I've heard people say similar things here, including some teachers... it drives all the good teachers I've had crazy. I think it's a bastardization of the old ""the victors write the history books"" chestnut, but *I* was always told that by family and good teachers as a *warning*, i.e. don't just read the victor's side.""Changing people's beliefs by using facts and evidence is a tough sell."" - oh yes. I live in Georgia, I know *all* about that! :);Karen, sorry, I think I was the one who wasn't clear - the ""what people believe"" quotation is absolutely true, the problem comes in when that's the end of the discussion (as it often is in my area)! I didn't mean to imply that the fellow who made that observation was anything less than a good teacher. :) In conversations about identity, I often joke that I am a person without a country. Born in Michigan, moved to in Georgia at age 7 (talk about culture shock), but in both cases, raised amongst ex-pats from the Republic, the North, England and Scotland. (Not so much Wales, for some reason. Not sure why that is.) My childhood was very much filled with observations, stories, ideas, and conversations that wouldn't be at all out of place in any pub (including the football!) It even colored very American things; our Thanksgivings are spent explaining the concept to the ex-pats who've never been through an American Thanksgiving, and answering the incredulous questions that result. (""Wait... so you lot have a huge over the top meal to commemorate annihilating the natives?"") I've seen both Gerry Adams and David Trimble speak. Larry Kirwan is a family friend and was one of the first people to help me get to grips with Irish. Our pantry was always full of goods you can't get here.... marmite, branston pickle, Barry's tea, hobnobs. (My American friends thought our house was some sort of magical wonderland - ""what is salad cream, and why are you reading a newspaper in another language?"") As to my schooling, the first year was spent at a segregated school for disabled students, which was its own culture. The next few years were spent at a private school my father called ""tree-hugging hippie school"" - it was one of the first schools to use what later came to be called Montessori. We had little deskwork and lots of discussion about current events and important historical figures (Ghandi, Dr. King, Mandela, world leaders, etc. Alan Trammel (baseball player) was our ""Person of the Week"" one week, but only because the Detroit Tigers had done really well for a change!)Schools then desegregated for disabled students, and we combined our move to Georgia with my entrance into public school. That was when I realized that everything I knew was either ""wrong"" (by the metrics of American schools) or at least, ""different."" All of a sudden I was going to school with students who had no knowledge of other cultures and teachers who didn't know what to do with me on any level - I'd been doing work at a 16 year old level at my private school, so I was terribly bored being plunked back in with 8 year olds, but I needed supports the public school system wasn't used to providing (I can't physically write by hand), and I was constantly trying to delve into topics at the depth I'd experienced at private school, which made me few friends and many enemies. I spent the next four years trying to learn how to ""be American,"" when all that time I'd thought I was already!I entered high school at 12 (instead of the more normal 14-15) and finally found a rhythm and a sense of belonging in my small town southern school, which had fantastic teachers who saw something in me and pushed me harder than I'd ever been pushed in my life. (My mother still likes to relate the tale wherein I came home from school crying because I had a C in English for the interim grading period - a C! I thought the world was going to end. Mom asked if she needed to call the teacher. My reply: ""No... Two of us got a C, the rest of us failed."" At that point, mom was *definitely* going to call the teacher. Me: ""No... she said this is a gifted level class and we're not doing gifted level work."" Mom: ""Is that true?"" Me: ""I guess so... but this is *hard*!"" Mom called the teacher... to thank her. :) ) It scares the hell out of me that if I'd been born about 5 years earlier and had had different parents, I might not be able to type this sentence. Segregated schools in the 70s and 80s US were more like ""holding pens"" or ""respite care"" for disabled pupils - very little learning went on (that wasn't the fault of the teachers, but rather the system, which dumped all of the disabled pupils of a similar age into the same classroom, regardless of their abilities or limitations). Anyway, it all results in me having little idea how to answer the identity question. ""Irish-American"" works in casual conversation, but the term is so diluted these days that it doesn't really convey how proud I am of my heritage, and how immersed I've been in its culture. At the same time, I have no right to claim more than that (and I would never dare!). ""Disabled"" is certainly a culture, and one I ""speak"" fluently (I can carry on a conversation in ASL, ""see"" for a blind person, help someone navigate obtaining a service dog, advise someone on how to figure out a way for them to do laundry or cook a meal, and repair pretty much any wheelchair on the market, as well as playing several wheelchair sports most of my life), but the non-disabled world doesn't recognize it as such - to them, disability is a terrible thing that we should work to erradicate. ""American"" is certainly true too - despite myself, I do love this country in many ways, particularly the optimism of its political system as written. The founding fathers, the Kennedys, and FDR are nothing short of heroes to me. On the other hand, many aspects of this country drive me crazy, and the connotations of ""American"" to the rest of the world (and certain subsets of Americans) are not something with which I like being associated. Despite living in the South for 24 years, ""Southern"" definitely doesn't apply. ""Midwestern"" fits much better (and most Americans peg me as such right away) - but then I have to explain how and why I haven't lived there since I was very young, and that I only visit once a year. ""German-American"" certainly fits - my father's side of the family has a decidedly Teutonic bearing, and I've had people pick that out in me too - but then I have to explain why I speak Irish, not German, and why everything else about me is so distinctly *Irish* (to the point where Irish-born people have asked me what county I'm from and told me my American accent is *brilliant*!) I envy the Americans I know who can proudly say with no equivocation that they're American, full stop. I have always felt like an outsider looking in to this country, but I've never known exactly where I'm looking in from.;Not to mention Li'l Stan Lee:;Pre-Freud, pre-secularism, pre-mass media... I like to think they'd be intrigued, though some of our ideas would be just plain baffling, rooted as they are in almost 200 years of cultural difference! But I reckon they'd be up for it. They wanted to preserve the Tales as they heard them, but they were devoted to the project of understanding them. I reckon the Grimms would be pleased as punch that we're still puzzling over it all :);I'm confused because I can't find space for the title. Unless the title's counted as part of the word count?  ;Thinking of The Company of Wolves turned my thoughts on to Tanith Lee's fantasies.  Red as Blood, or Tales from the Sisters Grimmer  had that genuinely weird, archaic feel to them that she also used in  Tales From The Flat Earth.  Her White As Snow  felt old, old, old with its Kore-Demeter themes and its terrifyingly warped trees and folk magic.My Grandma wouldn't have told tales like the Grimm tales - they'd have been a bit too demented for her. The sanitised versions are what she told us. The scarier, darker versions are what kids tend to seek out for themselves.;Urban fantasy often deals very much with fairy tales: Characters from the Grimm collection, from mythology from all over the world, magical and religious traditions pop up in modern settings.Charles de Lint's written lots of urban fantasy novels set in a fictional town, Newtown, near a Native reservation in Canada. Some of the inhabitants find their ways to the Otherworld through odd, liminal places (a tree in a park, abandoned buildings, etc.), encountering their ancestral spirits and the gods, spirits and magic their forebears brought with them to Canada from Europe. And the Native spirits are a constant presence, communicating with those tribal members who uphold traditional views and practices. When I read Gaiman's American Gods, which I adore, I did wonder if he'd been reading de Lint.There's a whole chunk of fantasy literature in this vein, in which modern people are forced to accept the reality of fairies and other supernatural beings, having to visit the fairies' home territory (often described as bewildering, dangerous and frightening) as well as having to repair or mitigate the effects the Otherworld is having on ours.  Raymond E Feist's Faerie Tale is set almost entirely within a fairy mound as a father searches for his abducted child. Laurell K Hamilton has written a whole series about a fairy princess desperate to escape the ongoing war between the Seelie and Unseelie courts. It's becoming very popular to examine fairy traditions this way, especially by female authors.;My intro to his books was Onion Girl, and my husband's was Trader. The books all tend to work as stand-alones, though as you read more of them you can see how they interlock.

I seem to recall that Baba Yaga asks Vaselisa (?) to answer the riddle of the white, red and black horsemen.;Good old Robert Graves - where would 20th century Neopaganism have been without him? :);I don't remember not reading. I could certainly read before I got to school. Reading was just something everyone in the family did. We had practically no cash, but there were enough cousins and neighbours to keep books flowing like the melange in Dune.  As a kid, I'd read anything. Books, comics, the labels on tins at the shop...  ;We seem to have a lot in common :)Comics had to come out of pocket money or be passed along from someone else, so they were more occasional treats than anything else. Dad had read The Eagle when he was a kid, and The Beano and The Dandy were classic parts of a working class British childhood. Though I think they'd both have been horrified if they'd realised that 2000AD  and Misty contained such... ""mature themes"". I think they saw comics as normal, benign kid-lit, so I got away with it without being checked.It was the books that worried them. Having been absolutely petrified by Poe at 7 years old, I was under strict instructions about not reading books that were too grown-up and scary, and they did linger around while I was scouring the library, and had an understanding with the librarians that anything ""too much"" for me would be gently discouraged.  ;Oh, good grief, Megan - I think our Dads were clones.Kathleen - it IS a good question. My sister loves reading, but she never read as avidly or omnivorously as me. She was way better at art than me, and was very much a visual learner. I've slowed down because ME (CFS) causes varying degrees of ""brain fog"" that can make reading harder. I suppose that, like Megan, growing up in a family where word games are the norm, from competitive punning to Scrabble to Boggle, helps. As a late primary school child, I was very much bullied, and I was always what my Mum called ""a self-sufficient, solitary soul"". Given the choice between playing out and reading, reading usually won out. Socialising is really important to me, but my ideal adulthood was very much on the lines of spending my life reading... well, everything. Maybe being a bookworm's innate.  ;It is the weirdest thing, isn't it, how literature classes at school tend to suck the life and pleasure right out of reading. I was already addicted enough to reading to find pleasure despite it.  How brilliant that you bucked the trend and became a reader as an adult!  ;There's something about the Harry Potter books, apparently! I read the first one, and never got round to the rest, though I enjoyed it tremendously. An old acquaintance has a daughter with serious learning difficulties who found reading incredibly frustrating. But when she was 11 years old, her parents gave the first Harry Potter book. They realised she'd gone very quiet, and went and stood for ages at her bedroom door just watching the pleasure on her face as she read. It transformed her experience of reading forever.It sounds like your kids are doing really well. An A* is tough to get when you're working in your own language! Congratulations :);Oh, wow. Samantha was looking for audio books in this thread - we should definitely put a link there.;And some very cool art based on it:  http://www.themarysue.com/amelia-pond-alice-in-wonderland/;It is cringe-making and emotionally tiring. Mind you, it's all around us still. If you've seen the Everyday Sexism project, for instance, or checked out feminist geek culture sites like Feminist Frequency  or The Mary Sue, Nine Worlds, or  Finding Ada, there's brilliant light shed on the ways in which women, queer and trans people, people with disabilities, and people of colour are treated in SF&F art and culture.  I am nowhere near as aware of issues around disabilities and colour as I need to be. Yet. There is a cultural shift going on, with Den Of Geek, for example reporting on this year's Cripping The Con.I read a lot of vintage and Victorian literature, and it's fascinating to see how attitudes have shifted. It's also uncomfortable to see how much in play those attitudes still are in wider culture today, though damped down. We've learned that being overtly bigoted is socially unacceptable. The problem is that we've tended to assume that it's only the overt displays that are problematic. It is hard to find the more subtle underlying assumptions in ourselves and others and deal with it.And you're right. There's a point at which dealing with in-your-face bigotry makes you want to throw things. Saeed's made a great point: we can de-fang it by dealing with it as a group. Mutual support makes all the difference.;There's a good essay about how being a member of multiple minority groups really throws the unexamined assumptions of the dominant group in your face here - a bi-racial (White and Native American), queer, trans, poly, working class geek on comic cons. The comments are also interesting.;This is really interesting. Thank you :)In early 19th century England, spinning, brewing, baking and dancing were masculine pursuits as well as feminine. I'm from an old textiles town, and spinning and weaving were pretty much evenly spread across families and age groups in this area before the industrial revolution; when the machines came, spinning became almost entirely the province of women and children. Brewing was a woman's work up until the late middle-ages when the ale laws came in, pushing women out of owning alehouses and brewing for them. Baking was a communal activity here outside of big houses, with communal ovens dotted about, usually run by men. And dancing was an important social skill for everyone.Was it the same in Germany?I love how many areas for exploration you've opened up in one tale!The tradition of Lilith having known God's name is something I didn't know at all. That is fascinating.;Frustrating, isn't it, that there were so many socially engaged and well-respected women involved in all areas of intellectual endeavour, and yet they're airbrushed from history.;There is a tendency to assume that criticising a book/graphic novel/film/tv series/game for this sort of thing means you can't enjoy it, or that if you enjoy it you can't criticise it. As Anita Sarkeesian put it, it's vital to enjoy and criticise in order to make what you love even better.;I think it's true that you can portray a fully inclusive and nonviolent society in an exciting way. Conflict isn't necessarily about violence. Conflict will always occur because people vary so much. We tend to think of peace and inclusivity as a passive, static state when they're really processes, ways of being in the world that foster creativity and adventure. There may be more innovation than in an egalitarian world in which nonviolence and co-operation mean that education and the confidence to experiment are the norm.  But the physical fight is ingrained as short-hand for ""standing up for yourself"" in our world. Want to show how a woman is empowered? Give her a gun and make her ""kick-ass"" (generally while she's wearing high heels and something skin-tight). Want to show a slave asserting their own power? Have them kill their master. Want to demonstrate a revolution? Make it violent.It's so ingrained that it takes a lot more creativity and hard work to come up a nonviolent reaction to violence, and to even imagine that a story that doesn't include violence can be thrilling, absorbing or meaningfully deal with some form of conflict. Some of the best SF&F manages it by doing it on a small scale (Bradbury does this repeatedly), and though there's something of an Anglophone fascination with Quakers (for some reason, we pop up quite a bit in sci-fi), there's a tendency to go down the easy, well-trodden route of the hero as The Just Warrior, whose violence is done in the name of good, and is therefore morally justifiable, so we can all just chuck our qualms out of the window and stop worrying about it.I have a tremendous love for blockbuster sci-fi films and tv series (how excited am I about the new Agents of SHIELD series?? And the love of Wolverine is almost lifelong), and yet I'd still like to see them do better in the creative approaches to solving terrible problems stakes.  ;Nathan - I didn't articulate that well. I wasn't saying you meant that conflict necessarily must mean violence (physical or otherwise); I was saying that this is how it's played out in most areas of fiction today, and that sci-fi and fantasy are often guilty of dealing with controversy and conflict through violence.  Of course we need to read things that are controversial, and deal with issues that make us uncomfortable, things that potentially disrupt our prejudices. We need to be stretched. Seeing structural violence as well as physical violence embedded in stories as the natural order, or what is morally right, time after time after time, though, can be wearing. And that's a problem for fantasy (in which so often the solution is a bunch of fairly privileged folk fighting for the return of The Rightful King to rule over his happily top-down hierarchy) and sci-fi (in which so often the solution is for the hero to take up violence/learn to temper his violence with mercy so as to be a Just Warrior).;Yes.So often, the people pushing for this are not the people who have suffered because of those attitudes, and aren't actually comfy enough with the people who have to ask their opinions and shed some prejudices. I do wonder how many of those adults who object are just trying to dodge hard questions from their kids.  ;In my experience, there's plenty of ground between ""It doesn't bother me"" and ""It bothers me so I want to censor it"". It's not an either/or proposition. The ground between those reactions is the fertile area for discussion and growth.;I wish I could upvote this a gazillion times.Yes.

I have to say I disagree with the opinion that there was a problem of communication between mother and her daughter. 18th century mothers (or grandmas) who told this story would not wish to give such a message to their children. Fairy tale mothers almost  always personify morality and protection.;Hello Anahita, That is an interesting point! I have been thinking about this, too. You have mentioned Cinderella or Aschenputtel in German or Cendrillon in French or   in my maternal language  - Slovak -  Popolu  ka :) This story is incredibly spread throughout the whole world. I even read that Cinderella is originally a Chinese fairy tale, which I don't know if it is true... but who knows? And this is not just Cinderella. Lots of the same fairy tales are commonly told in different parts of the world, perhaps with  subtle nuances.  I think they may have developed independently because people went through pretty similar situations in their everyday life. Whether the  fairy tale  was meant to be a warning story with didactic purpose or a story that personified ideals and values they believed in (therefore it was pleasant to listen to), some similar motives  may have develop independently and later influenced each other. And as a result, we know the same or very similar fairy tales all over the world.;"

She's a little edgy with her ""red shoes"" and pouring herself a ""famous drink.""  ;I haven't looked at the edition we will be reading for this class, but I recently finished a course on fairytales at my University.

The True Bride and the Maiden Without Hands are two that stand out, hopefully they are included in the Lucy Crane edition!;I am confused and concerned about the grading process of the essay assignments. In the only other Coursera course I have taken, the students were given credit for the peer assessments they did, but the grades were not counted toward any official grade for the course. The peer assessments were used for feedback only, and often valuable, but in many cases, not so much. I tried to read about the peer assessments in this course, but it is rather confusing. Are the grades given by peers counted as part of our overall, official grade, or are we just given credit for doing them? If the former is the process for this course, I will not participate in the essays. As an educator myself who uses peer evaluations in my own classes, I would never allow the grades given by other students to be the official grade or part of the official grade at the end of a class. The answer to this question will determine whether or not I participate fully in this course, so a timely answer would be greatly appreciated!;Lol, this thread made me laugh.   Y'all are reading into things far too deeply.   Just read the books, get your peer essays and give your honest views.   You are going to get a ""pass"" or ""fail"" on the basis of doing your work.   Anything more than that is a bonus!

I don't think animals care about number sequences or patterns.   If you notice in some stories though, they do go that fourth time.   And it feels off.   ;I kind of just stand by three ""sounds good"".    Think of a 3-legged stool.   Two legs and it would just fall over.

My mother would yell at me about it.   Then when my sister was about 20, I heard my mom call her ""fishwife"".   My take on these stories is more about the character of the fisherman's wife.   She never seems to change.   She is always bossy, and can't be pleased.   I think that these stories were told to amuse people because we all know someone like that.

Thank you so much for the tip, Byurakn!;Those tales do  not only reflect the society and the time during which they were written, but they also had a huge impact on people's life.  I imagine how this way of looking at  life  highly encouraged marrying  your very first love... Or more dramatic... Made girls easily accept to marry the first man who asked for  their hand.Stories are very powerful vectors of ideas. They can highly influence a whole generation. They can be used in many different ways. I tend to comment the stories I read to my kids and ask them questions to help them think critically about the story. I prefer stories which will empower my children.Traditional tales  including princesses and dragons  are highly interesting and part of our culture... But... ""How to train a dragon"" reflects today's ideals. I read so so so many times all my fairy books when I was a kid, and I had plenty of very traditional ones in original versions... They had a huge influence on me. Maybe not always a good one, because I did not live in the same world anymore... And, being able to think about them critically came later I believe. But I have to say that they did nourish my imagination from a very young age. Little Red Cap from the Grimm was inspired from  Little Red Ridding Hood  first written by Charles Perrault. But, Charles Perrault did not invent that story which  used to be told in families the evening near the fire. It evolved sort of in a darwinian way... slowly from old myths... Most stories tell how to survive in the world...  (Don't follow strangers...) Stories can save.  Stories can cure, Stories can do so many things, really...    When you tell a story... Be aware of its power... Make good use of it...;I didn't read the Six Soldiers of Fortune as a model of teamwork, more of how the soldiers were greedy and deceitful. I'm going to have to go back and read this one again to see if I can find the optimism in the character's actions. :-) Thanks!;I think the reason the story doesn't portray the soldiers as greedy is hidden in the beginning of the story: these soldiers fought for a king, but the king did not reward them afterwards as he should have.For a contemporary parallel in the US, see the current backlog of VA claims for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.   You could imagine retelling the story with a brigade of veterans storming Washington and carrying off medical supplies or something.;This is an ongoing problem for me as I teach successive on-line courses, i.e., forgetting where all the dates are and resetting them for the next class.   I'm sure the staff that monitor the forums will get the dates updated soon (and only wish I had administrative assistants who would do the same for me.);Not only step-mothers as I noticed.The fathers are usually good, wise and thoughtfull (I'm right after the story about The Straw, The Bean and The Coal).Mothers like in ""Hansel and Grethel"", ""The Three Spinsters or ""The Raven"" are always the bad ones.  Not only mothers but women in overall too like in ""The Fisherman and his Wife"" and put in the bad light like in ""Clever Grethel"". Evil witches...Where are the bad men? One example is the King in the story of soldiers, other the The Wonderful Musician. The second still concerns me, why the Musician was not punished.PS. I apologise for spelling mistakes if any in the stories' titles.;Although I do not agree with everything you said, the first point you made regarding the causes are exactly what i was going for. The thought that the kings had a right to rule is a given, because if you think about it, when someone is rich and has everything handed out to him/her just because he/or she was born to someone already with power, then that can only mean that that person is in fact lucky, from birth. On the other hand, that would mean that people who weren't lucky to be born like that would have to accomplish great deeds in order to change their status (because being born again into a different family and strata is not an option).That being said, I cannot agree when you say that people of low birth have their skills taught o them. So far, from what I have read, it seems those people already have those skills and they just never noticed or actually used them to their advantage. Take the story of the little tailor who killed seven flies with one strike for example; one cannot assume he only found out he had all that cunning in him by killing a bunch of flies, that was just the motto for the story to start, an excuse for him to have something to brag and make himself noticed.;Hmmm. Is there a history of matriarchy in Northern Europe? I don't remember learning that (though it's entirely possible that I am simply unaware....).;Hi Byurakn, Yes, I hadn't noticed that. You are right, the simplicity is part of it. The way they portray the human, is devoid of complexity, too. I just finished reading a very modern novel, Little Brother, and comparing the two works, I can definitely see this. And also conflicts are resolved withing fairy tales without much dwelling. Like in that horrifying faithful John, the horrific decision the king makes at the end about his children, is made in a line. It makes me think of the contemporary debate on free will. As much as some of the tales are morality tales, the way they are presented sides with the system view of free will, that each person, the system that he is, behaves and decides in a certain way, not much dwelling. Cinderella is kind and obedient by nature. She doesn't dwell on whether or not to confront the stepmother. If some character shows a change, it's due to seeing the result of what he has done, like in the raven. Then his system changes to another one.  Very illuminating thought,Thanks;"

I find contextualising a piece of literature by learning about the era and part of the world it was written in incredibly enlightening to my reading. Often I will read first and then research afterwards, as others have said, it's a good idea to get your own perspective first, even if that perspective is all over the place at least your head is filled with ideas which are placed there by the literature itself as opposed to other sources. I like to read other sources which are not directly linked to the novel or story itself (for example for the Grimm Tales I just googled nineteenth century Germany, looked for a decent enough webpage, and I'm now faced with a wealth of information which is allowing me to further develop my ideas and I can go back to the Grimm text with new insight into my original points).;Hoi Byurakn,Niet Groningen, maar wel...

Actually, it was the first book ever that I read in English.Currently reading The Portable Poe (yeah, I'm a bit ahead of time because I'm sure 5 days are not enough for me to finish a book).;I started to love reading even before I knew the alphabet. As a child, somehow I was convinced that as soon as I learn the alphabet I will start reading. I was wrong because I started reading even before I knew the alphabet! My school was going in a slow pace (one or two letters a week and my language has 39 letters), so learned rest of the letters by myself and picked up a book. That's how it started. Then my grandmother had to provide me with books, so for a long time I mostly read what she liked, unless she wasn't around and I picked random books from my mother's bookshelf.;I'm sure all the tales have a certain meaning. We're just not there yet to understand them. It's good that you pointed out Fred and Kate and Clever Else because I wanted to open a separate topic about these two stories to discuss them from a cultural point of view.The thing is that we have similar tales in Armenian culture but the messages are much simpler or I'd rather say they are constructed in a way that you totally understand what they're talking about. In the one that is equivalent to Clever Else, a father sends his eldest daughter to bring water from the spring. She goes there, notices a tall tree and starts to think that if she gets married, she will have a son, he will climb the tree, then fall from it and die. And she starts crying. Then the second daughter is sent to the spring. The eldest daughter tells her the story, they start crying together. The youngest one and then their mother is sent. They all sit there and cry. Finally the father goes there and after having learned the story he suggests to stop crying and to have the funeral of the child and carry on.In my culture it's a common practice to start worrying about something that hasn't even happened yet or that you haven't tried it out. I think it is very well shown in the tale and a solution is provided. The tale suggests get rid of non-existing worries by burying it.As for Clever Else, the plot is similar but the message doesn't seem to be the same because it's not focused on Else's worries, it's rather pointing out how ""clever"" she is. I think there is some kind of irony in it. Also, I don't understand the second part of the story about Else's laziness. Does the tale have a message against quick marriages? Is it making fun of female mind, showing that a female cannot be clever? These are my suggestions but I might be wrong.;Javier, I don't know. :) But my guess is that if ""the boy is already dead"", then cutting down the tree won't help, a funeral is a better idea.;karishma, I know it's strange but it's also what Else worries about. By the way, while posting this comment I came up with an idea. If we have a look at Germans, in general they like planning their lives well ahead. Sometimes it's so extreme that someone who has just started their professional career, starts making plans for retirement. Maybe that's what's reflected in Clever Else and that's why she's actually considered as ""clever.""Ah, about my name. Well, it's not a very common one in my country either. If you can read IPA, then this is the way to pronounce it: [bju   _  k  n];Actually I had an impression that Stoker was criticizing the concept of New Woman. I think he was more trying to show to beauty of each gender in their roles and how complementary they are. I also think that Mina was presented as an exception to the general rule (having told that she has a masculine brain already underestimates the feminine brain) but in the end of the story puts her where she belongs.  ;Indeed, I've noticed something about time in Through the Looking Glass, when Alice meets one of the Queens, who has a backward memory (i.e. remembers things before they happen).;Everywhere in the course it says that we have to assess at least 4 of our peers but a minute ago as I was doing that, the system showed at least 5 students. So what is the correct minimum number?;It's a bit weird for me to grade cut down marks for language when I'm not a native speaker myself. However, it is always easy to see if the errors are a result of being a non-native speaker (in some cases I can even guess what's the person's native language) or they were simply too lazy to proof-read it.  ;"

Actually, the most striking thing about this language issue was that one character reporting the other's speech used their language rather than converting it to their own. Well, I guess Stoker didn't know much about psycholinguistics.  ;Am I the only one who is happy with all the comments she gets so far?  ;Yeah, early release would be great.

Somehow I had the impression that Victor takes on God job, creating an intelligent animal and that's the reason he fails.;I'm more than halfway through the book and I also dislike the protagonist and I feel kind of sympathy towards the monster but I'm not sure if it was what the author meant.  ;Totally agree, Cheri. I would add that Frankenstein was the one who created the creature, so he should have known what he was creating. It was Frankenstein who gave him the monstrous appearance, so there must be something devilish hidden in Frankenstein and not the monster.  ;I've already finished the readings for this unit. What I've seen in Hawthorne's work is the impossibility or short life of perfection.  ;Yeah, same here. There was enough chasing throughout the book anyways.  ;After having read Elizabeth's letter to Victor, where she mentioned that William was taller for his age, I had an impression that he was at least in his teens. As he died, they started referring to him as ""child."" I thought maybe it was because of grief or because he was younger than Elizabeth and Victor anyways, so a teenager might as well be a child for them or maybe he was still in his early teens. But as soon as I reached the part where the monster told the story how   he killed William, I became terribly puzzled, as William's words about his papa sounded like a four-year-old's. Also, the other thing I know is that William can't be younger than six years, if he was born shortly before Victor left Geneva. So approximately how old was William when he died? Have I missed something or Shelley herself didn't give him a proper age?  ;oh, I reread that part. it turns out that Ernest was sixteen, not Wiliam. so confusing. is it me or the book didn't tell what happened to Ernest?;As I was traveling last week, I managed to submit my essay just an hour before my flight but I couldn't grade any essays, as I didn't have internet while I was traveling. I know that it's a general rule in Coursera, if you don't submit feedback, you don't receive one. To my surprise, I received feedback. Does this mean that my grade is going to be counted or did I misunderstand the rule, I receive feedback but I don't receive credit? Although I got a lower grade this time (a 3, just what it deserved, since I didn't make grade efforts), I'd be happy if it was counted.

Of course, it won't be changed for this course but maybe it's something the staff might want to consider for future courses.;There is something else I just thought of. Actually, Victor keeps complaining about how miserable he is because all of his loved ones are dead. He has nobody else left on earth, so he's lonely but hold on... doesn't he do the same to the creature? Doesn't he deprive him of possible happiness with a companion? I think the monster kills everyone to make Victor feel what he feels but Victor refuses to understand it until the end of his life.  ;Anna, yes, it's something I asked in another thread. So Ernest stays alive, after all. I thought I missed something.  ;My answer would also be yes at least to the first two questions. If you compare it to the creation of Adam, God thought that it's not good for a man to be alone and created a woman for him, while Frankenstein is selfish and doesn't want to understand what the creature thinks.  I can't say anything about the creature family and what would have become of them, it totally depends on the author of the book. My idea is that Frankenstein, as their creator, should have control over them at least to some extent, such as making them infertile, thus avoiding reproduction.  ;I don't want to sound harsh but could it be the comments are not as mean as we see them? I mean, I'm really happy with my grades (4, 3, 5) and they totally reflect the effort I put in. My first essay was good but nothing special, the second one was something for the sake of submitting something because I didn't have a clear idea what to write about (and I got 1 for content) and I worked much harder on my Dracula essay. The comments were sometimes contradicting (perfect grammar vs. many grammatical mistakes, so far the best essay I've read vs. this essay doesn't make any sense) but the grades actually averaged to what my essays deserved. Moreover, I agreed with most of the criticism and with what I didn't agree, I just let it go.This is my second MOOC. Peer evaluation is involved in the previous one, too. Actually I finished that one with almost maximum grades but the peer review for the last assignment was striking. Everyone gave constructive feedback, except for one peer, who just gave ""excellent"" for every section. It was more insulting for me than if someone would have written ""failed"" because I had already read the example solution and I knew I did not give perfect answers to some of the questions. Do you want to see these empty ""excellents""?I'd suggest everyone to take things easier and not to forget that we're all from different countries with different backgrounds and we don't understand things the same way. I know, there is a small number of people who are having fun trying to insult others. I think the best thing to do is just ignoring them. After all,   and the large number of reviews helps to average out a grade we deserve.  ;I had the same thought when reading the book. Where were the editors?  ;English is not my native language and I normally don't comment on grammatical errors, unless they are really striking ones (e.g. omitting -s in verb inflection for third person singular) but the essay I have just reviewed was way too far from being written in English. I had a feeling it was google translated. Some foreign words were still remaining in the text.In general, the structure was fine, I could see the thesis, examples and conclusion but it was very difficult to understand. The author was trying to discuss an interesting topic, the examples were fine. So I actually gave 1 for structure and 2 for content. What would you do in such cases?;Jeremy, thank you for the explanation.Being a linguistics student myself, I can even guess the native language of the author based on the errors. I know that I make many errors related to articles and aspect. Although the -s omission is a striking mistake, I never cut marks for it and I give 2's. But when it's a google translated essay... I just don't know how to deal with it and I don't want to sound harsh because I know that some people really do try hard (and actually I could see it from the content).I am familiar with IELTS.

It's just something that I am able to notice as a non-native speaker, that's why I gave that example. I never mark down anyone just for omitting an -s.

In the content part he or she goes on pointing that Prof. Rabkin said we should discuss literary matters. What can I say to this reviewer? Watch your spelling? Add some information on how the feedback should be written according to the professor? No way, it would turn into a fight. So I'm glad we don't have the chance of talking to our reviewers. It saves time and nerves. Besides, there is always some constructive feedback, which helps me to learn more. Although, I must admit that this week I got constructive feedback from only two peers (as there is also a positive feedback that doesn't help me at all).  ;I think nothing is ever enough. If the word limit was 1000 words, there would still be people who would think it's not enough. The same would be with 2000 and so on.

Still, I think it's worth the time. And I absolutely love reading other participants' essays and discussion forums. It is also a great new experience for me, since I haven't done any literature courses before.  ;I think I'm also an addict but since I'm also a perfectionist, I cannot take more than one course at a time, so I keep adding courses to my watchlist, to make sure I always have that one course to follow.The only online course I have had so far is statistics making sense and it was great. After having struggled with statistics for so many years it really started making sense to me. Moreover, I enjoyed the whole process of learning.

From Bradbury I've read Farenheit 451 Degrees,  which was ok, I didn't hate it and  Dandelion Wine, which I loved but according to my understanding of SciFi, it is not SciFi, and also the Martian Chronicles  which I really hated but it was very-very long ago, so I might change my mind in this course.;I love this topic!I have different writing patterns for different fields. For this course, I come up with a thesis well before starting the actual writing process. Then I start thinking and thinking of examples, of sentences and ideas I would like to use in my essay. When the thinking process is done (it's usually by Sunday or Monday afternoon), I start writing the first draft always watching for the word limit. Then I leave it like that and revise my essay just few hours before the deadline on Tuesday. Well, I know that I'm not making too much effort and my theses are always something obvious, though I like going deep for finding examples.I'm currently writing my MSc thesis, which is much tougher. I just come up with thoughts and write it down here and there. I have no idea how I am going to join them together in the end.But then there is creative writing, which I absolutely love doing and I do it in my native language most of the time. That's when writing comes to me very easily. People don't believe me that I can write a 2000 word short story in just 40 minutes. Of course, then I need to spend many hours editing it and making it look the way I want to (which never happens). The same goes for my blog posts. If I have half an hour and I don't know what to do, I just write a 1000-2000 blog post about anything I can think of.;Same here. This is the first time that I haven't given a 1 to anyone.

There was nothing about the required reading and the form wasn't quite ok either because it was less than 270 words.

Of course, there are things that were not discovered yet in the end of 19th century but I think it will be fun to find out what he got wrong by then.For example, in  The Island of Doctor Moreau, Dr. Moreau discusses the issue of making animals talk and he succeeds by just operating their vocal organs. However, nowadays it is clear that the reason of animals not talking is not just about the anatomical structure of their mouth and throat but also it is about brain structure (animals don't have Broca's and Wernicke's areas).Also, in  The Invisible Man Griffin says that he couldn't go down the stairs because he couldn't see his feet. It would be true if, besides being invisible, Griffin lost his proprioception for some reason.  Any other examples?;I think you're right. Do you remember that famous test touching your nose with your index finger with your eyes closed? Every healthy individual can do it. And even if you can't quite walk down the stairs in darkness, it's not because you can't see your feet but because you can't see the stairs.  ;The question is not about animals being able to have language or language like signaling system. The question is about human language. You can never operate an animal in a way to make them able to learn the human language. It's not about vocal tract, it's about brain. It's something Wells didn't know by that time.;"

It is helpful to know the historical facts for the setting of a story, but not necessarily the Author's mindset or critical reviews of the piece.

A younger reader with less education and experience will not read it the same way and is likely to miss many themes the author included.

You may see social mobility based on skill and courage in working men and beauty and sweetness in working women, but the women in that group have to be sweet and beautiful while suffering, where the men have to be brave and clever. Sometimes princesses have to be chucked out of the castle to prove how sweet and beautiful they are while suffering. But, by and large, it's all about the high status men being already entitled to their luck and the low status men having to earn it. It's very socially conservative.I think it's a cracking thesis.;Fabio, I hate to be the bearer of negative counter points, but I can think of another one besides ""The Frog Prince"". In the story ""The Knapsack, The Hat, and The Horn"" the main protagonist is a very poor boy who becomes successful through the luck of him finding a magical table cloth. His luck continues as he continues to find powerful magical items that he is able to steal, and use to eventually become king. I could be wrong, so do correct me if I am.;Byurakn, I think you're onto something... If one of them hadn't been there, the whole thing would have fallen apart. And yes, Sydney, that is one of the exceptions I was referring to.Fabio, that's a valid point right there. Although, I DID assume he found out about his skill by killing a bunch of flies. Perhaps I should re-read that. Thanks.That being said, I would like to point out that I was taking all of fantasy into account, not just the Grimms. Uhmmm... Let me get back from the office and I'll illustrate a few examples on this.... but if this is intended for your thesis (and that should cover just the Grimms) then perhaps I'm overreaching. ;There's definitely snobbery and social discrimination in the tales.   When there's a King's daughter's hand in marriage up for grabs and the challenge is met by a 'lucky' poor person, the King or his daughter always go back on their word and it's only by continuing to meet extra challenges set for them that the King or his daughter seem to give up and allow the peasant into their social class.;Oh, good! :);Oooh - Peggie, that's great!I don't know about German history, but I do know that the Vikings had a concept of hamingja  which was a part of the self connected with luck which could   be passed on to descendants and even loaned out. It seems the Norse viewed the self as a sort of gestalt entity comprised of various components that could be detached at will. The Saxons seem to have viewed the web of Wyrd  as the unfolding of fate, which had strings which could be tugged on to alter your luck - as long as you were exceptionally careful about it.;I think your thesis more or less applies to both genders.;I guess it's optional. I wouldn't share the final draft, but the idea, if you are in doubt.  ;I love the idea of your thesis, and I agree with others about the viewpoint at the time of the creation of the stories with nobility being considered to rule by divine right and perhaps continuing the round of luck they had beginning at birth to be born into their class. To that point, from the view point of the story tellers, who were probably all lower class, nobles were the lucky ones never having to work for anything while the commoners had to work to accomplish anything in their lives. It strikes me as a simple fact of existence for them and a lesson to the youngsters telling them they'll have to work for everything.;"

The hare is in some places associated with the moon and the moon is also linked to agrary cicles.  ;Hi, Here is my assignment:The Grimm Brothers' Fairy tale    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN GOSLINGS    makes evident the semantic proximity of the symbols which represent the mother and the symbols which represent the death. When the goose mother departs to find food for her children, she advices they about the perils of death represented by the Wolf. In her advice the wolf can be recognized by the hoarse voice and the black paws. While the hoarse voice is an extension of the nibbling symbolism through the mouth image, the black paws integrate both the aggressive animal symbolism and the night/darkness symbolism. In according to the french anthropologist Gibert Durand animal and dark symbols might be understanding as the faces of death when negatively valued. The same kind of symbols when it   s euphemized and positively valued can represent the mother. For example, when the night brings a sensorial realism which induces comfort and when the action of biting become to swallow without hurting but protecting.   So when the wolf tries to disguise himself as the goose mother, the horrible aspects of his animalism and his darkness are precisely the elements which reveal him. But when he can disguise these specific aspects he can trick the little gooses and, not incidentally, he look likes their mother.On the other hand, it   s just because the death symbols are symmetric to mother/birth symbols and also because the digestive stomach is symbolically confused with the sexual belly and so with the womb which generates and protect the life that the mother goose can rescue her children of the wolf stomach.   The wolf who swallows the gooses seems to be pregnant of they and the goose mother can bring her children from the death to the life in a new birth .  Thank you for your comments.;"

Laura, I am not a native English speaker, so I really appreciate your generosity in correcting my poor grammar.   Martha, in his book Antropological Structures of the Imaginary, Gilbert Durand (2012) talks about the semantic proximity of the sexual belly and the digestive stomach in a very interesting way, however, he points Freud has noticed this proximity before.   Laura, I did not talk about the clock, but I think you are right; it is a very import symbol in this context. When Gilbert Durand talks about faces of death it is always associated with faces of time. Time symbols can be seen as death symbols, but when they are positively valued, they can announce progress, salvation and even victory over the death through life cycle.

All your ideas do not have to take off every time, but the possibility has to always be there.   When an idea hits it hits big generating far more value than your long string of small wins and losses.    Fortunately there is a new book, Berger   s Contagious on what qualities are needed for an idea to takeoff.   This book proposes six key concepts which can lead to an idea taking off, which are summarized in the acronym STEPPS:           S     Sociality Currency         T     Triggers           E     Emotion           P     Public           P     Practical Value           S -- Stories    This analysis is very encouraging because the elements fit the type of work we are proposing very well.     Here are some key points on how we can use each of the six STEPPS:       1.           S     Sociality Currency:   We need to make our ideas something people will want to tell their friends.        2.           T     Triggers:   This is about making the idea something that immediately brings positive images to the mind.   What we are proposing are believable space exploration adventures that most people can identify with.          3.           E     Emotion:   This is about the idea directly bringing up positive emotions.   The awe of space and the call of adventure are powerful emotions we will rely on.        4.           P     Public:   This is about people accepting the idea as part of their public persona and not just their inner self.   Most people feel it is Ok to be for Space.   The percentage is through the roof for technical people.        5.           P     Practical Value:   This is about seeing the idea as positive and good for society.   Apollo to the Moon was on most lists of the best thing in 20th century.   There is every reason to think that we can make a major space exploration adventure one of the best things in 21st century.        6.           S     Stories:   This is about communicating with people in a way that they enjoy relating too.   This is what our test project is all about.

However one  of my favourite writers  of the Sci-Fi genre is not included; Iain M. Banks.  I mention Banks in particular because he has recently announced that he only has months to live due to terminal cancer. He has asked his publishers to hasten the publication of his last novel, which, unfortunately is a non sci-fi book (i.e. the ones he writes without the M) and I feel so sad that I will never again read some new witty ""Minds"" ship name or accounts of their petty squabbling, let alone the beautiful, complex stories he writes and the social engineering that is the Culture.Thank you so much to Iain for the pleasure he has given me.

Fortunately there is a 21st century way to address the problems and writing fits right in.  The 21st century approach to getting things done is to have a very large number of people in action on a problem nearly continuously.     This applies to writing as much as to all the problem solving examples you have seen on TED.    The action happens when individuals or teams come up with an idea and form a plan.   They then take action that tests the idea in some way.   The results of the test teach us something new and the process starts all over again with new planning based on new information.  This approach is a refinement of standard practices that thousands of people have been using for some time.   The change for the 21st century is to now have tens of thousands of people in such action and then to grow that number using modern communication technologies first to millions and then to billions.   We can and will thereby address the great problems of the 21st century.  Most of the projects are small, intentionally so, like writing a short story for example.   Each project puts only as many resources at risk as the originator feels comfortable with.   To play for the long-haul you cannot risk everything on every play.  Most of the projects fail and that is OK.   The primary purpose of most of the projects are just to teach you something so that you can do better next time.   It is OK to fail fast if you can survive the loose and come back with new ideas just as fast.  Above all the emphasis is on Do, which for us here means write!

I have been stopped for months by the need to get permission to publish from the place I work.   I work at a major R&D laboratory (which shall remain nameless) and they have a right to approve anything I publish.   They care a lot about technical publications because the quality of the publications of their people effects their brand value greatly.     A number of us however also publish Sci-Fi fiction.   They do not care as long as their name does not appear in the publication but they still insist on a complex approval process.   This process should take 4 weeks, but because they do not really care about Sci-Fi at all, this one has now dragged out to 14 weeks.       Assuming I finally get the official paper work early next week (as promised by phone) I will log my remaining steps to e-publication on this tread.   I will be closely following:         Mark Cooker,    SlashWords Style Guide          http://www.smashwords.com/b/52    I trust this will be of value to some of you.

He chortled in his joy.    In the 21st century all projects, even writing projects, must follow a number of rules.   One of them is    Fail Fast   .     This means that you do not have a bunch of projects hanging around unfinished.   If they are not going anywhere, you declare them dead, lean what you can, and move on to other actions.    We allowed 6 weeks in our plan for this approval, It took 14 weeks.   Such an unplanned delay is more than enough to kill at    Fail Fast Project   .       Fortunately we can start a new project on the ashes of an old one just as fast as we can kill dead wood.   So that is what I must do now.   For the next couple weeks I will be running down the now dispersed Volume 01 team and coming up with a new plan.      The new plan might look a lot like the old one or be quite different.   The key idea is that the action forward can adapt to setbacks and is therefore hard to kill or may even be antifragile.    I well post again when I have a new plan.    References:    *   Leonard A.

(I know because if references the disruptions of the 1960's and I was there, in those streets, in San Fransisco no less.)   I think this story demands major discussion but it is the last one on the reading list and the course will be nearly over when it finally arrives.   Can we discuss major story problems in the forums before we get to them in the reading list?;OK, I will put my long version of a Frames analysis of ""Little Brother"" under the specific assignment.;You actually enter your assignment under ""Peer Responses"".Be sure to proof read it as best you can and remember the point of the course is to get better not to start off better.   Use your word processor to check the word count (I always have a problem keeping it down),You also get to enter References separately so they do not count in your word count.;What we could do to really help the reader is to obtain editable copies of these works and correct all the auto-scan problems.   It is clear that the older works were scanned in electronically from paper copies and then automatically covered to text.   This process leaves a large number of misread   characters in the text.This is a tedious process for one person to do for a whole book but it is not so difficult for 40 people to do 10 pages each.   The process requires an editable copy, usually in MicroSoft Word, and a photo copy, usually in Adobie .pdf.   Gutenberg may let volunteers do this.In my last class, one of the profs did this for a paper by Einstein which was seen as a major contribution. There he had the much harder task of correcting a translation from the German of major physics concepts.   What I propose is much easier.;In    Little Brother   , Doctorow makes a political error early in his story and never recovers.   He echoes the strife of the 60   s in scenes and locations, but he has learned nothing from it.   (I was there in those mean streets. The lessons were hard and they still control much of what is happening today.)     Sci-FI over Split over    Nam:    Then the country was then split over the Viet Nam War and the science fiction world split along with the country.   Stories were either Progressive and anti-war, or Conservative and justifying it.    Our reading,    The Martian Chronicles    is a good example of the very conservative stories.   It is Middle America transplanted to Mars without technical explanation.   The very conservative Heinlein also hated that another of his stories,    Stranger in a Strange Land    was adopted by the hippies (left) but that is another story.    The best of the progressive stories grew into    Star Trek, The Next Generation   .   The best of the conservative stories grew into    Star Wars   .     Major lessons were learned, but different people learned very different lessons and many people learned nothing at all.   The major lesson that Doctorow failed to learn is:   When an argument starts, the group that controls the Frame of Reference has already won!    Frame of Reference:    Human beings cannot hold the total universe in their minds.   To operate in society what we do is hold subsets of reality in our minds called    Frames of Reference   .   Each person may hold many Frames, (parent, child, worker, or technical specialist) and can switch between them in a few microseconds.    The political identities are Frames in this since.     They are by necessity incomplete and all Frames cherry pick the facts that support them.   This Frames analysis was developed by the extreme left (Ref. 1) but was used most effectively by the extreme right.    President Ronald Regan was a master of Framing.   His    Welfare Queen    Frame contained very little truth but brilliantly reinforced the Conservative Frame.     President Regan was known as the    Great Communicator    but it would be more true to the history of his time to call him the    Great Framer   .    Today in a debate, such as abortion, if one Frame talks about    service providers    and another frame about    Baby Killers   , then whichever group controls the frame of the debate on day one has already won.   This is why no true debates are now ever carried on.    Broken Plot Line:    Two different frames related to counteracting terrorism are available,    War on Terror    and    Policing   .       About  _ of the way through the story, the author has a surprise second 9/11 level terrorist event which defines the frame for the rest for the story.   This event is so large that only an organized terrorist group could have pulled it off.   This allows the authorities to operate in the    War on Terror    Frame with confidence that the majority of the American people will back them up.   It then does not matter how extreme their actions.    From then on, no matter why the protagonist does what he does, under the War on Terror Frame he will be seen by a majority to be in cahoots with a foreign enemy.   The author has already lost his argument!    Just last week, President Obama week gave a major speech starting the process of converting the official frame for dealing with terrorism from    War on Terror    to    Policing   .     This is a major change but has not yet been widely appreciated.    Alternative Plot Line:    Had the author made the terrorist incident smaller, say a couple of yahoos with pressure cooker bombs, then the American people would be likely to see limiting of the authorizes to the Policing Frame as the correct response.   The protagonist could then be presented as a protector of personal liberties.   Then the War on Terror response of the authorities would be seen as way out of proportion.     Under a Policing Frame, the protagonist could have adopted a    Martin Luther King    Frame and used his powerful IT skills to upgrade this historic frame into the 21st century.   The Arab Spring Frame showed bits and pieces needed for this updating, but did not use enough of the Martin Luther King Frame to show the power that an update of this frame could have.   The author, through the protagonist, could have then won the day, and taught the reader a world-changing lesson in the process.    In short, a great possibility for this story was in view but the author blew it because he does not understand his own history.

George Lakoff, The Political Mind:   A Cognitive Scientist   s Guide to Your Brain and Its Politics (Penguin, 2009)      ;Communism and Anti-Communism were both powerful Frames that drove the action for most of the 20th century.   Neither one achieved very much and both wasted enormous amounts of resources, but they did produce a lot of good stories (James Bond, etc.).   Replacing them with the War on Terror Frame is certainly likely to waste enormous resources and reduce personal liberty, but it doubt that it will produce much in the way of good story lines.;That was fast.I am not much worried about the character here.   What I regret is the author setting up the character to lose.   A 19 year old kid losing is not much of a story.     A 19 year old kid making a difference is a story.Given that all IT work is about dozens of small wins and loses and then an occasional really big win (called a Black Swan) for somebody.   The same drive that lead to a lose here could have been the big win if the author had set the story line up a little differently.I found this particular plot, boring and sad.;"

The telephone story broke a few weeks after the double bombing in Boston by two rogue actors with pressure cooker bombs.   In Doctorow   s story he has a double major bombing that could only be carried out by a large and well organized terrorist group.   After such an event the approval reading for extreme surveillance would be closer to 98% judging from 9/11.    The protagonist   s unrelated activities would surely draw attention and he would be detained indefinitely ending the story.   A much smaller incident and a clear over reaction from the authorities would have made a much better plot with a balance between more closely argued stands.    We will have to see how the    James Bond in the 21st century    frame plays out but after we add Big Data and killer drones to Bond   s usually gaggle of gadgets, the American people still want Bond on their side.

Stating with    Oblivion    and continuing     through the summer, each film costs more than $100,000,000; each has flawless,     breathtaking computer generated graphics; and each portrays a negative     future for human kind full of wars, terrorist acts, and ecological collapse.       The American people are owed something much better for their box office     money.   Apollo to the Moon made everybody   s top ten achievements of the 20th century.       There is no reason that a bold, adventurous space program cannot be in     the top ten lists for the 21st.   But to make that happen, billions     of people have to envision the action as a personal success, just as they     did Apollo.   In the 20th century specialists designed a major program, like Apollo,     and then leaders sold it to the public,    We shall go to the Moon  _   .       In the 21st century this entire process now runs backwards.   The first     step is now to envision the adventure in such a way that the idea runs     viral on the Internet and social media.   Then, if and only if, tens     of millions of people buy into the idea will there be any possibility that     the resources will be made available.  A new space mission idea now has to beat out    kitten playing the piano        before it can even get started.   So far, returning to the Moon and     going to an asteroid have both failed miserably in this bazaar contest.       New century; new rules.   Fortunately the new century has come with new tools.   The Silicon     Valley style entrepreneurial companies have lead the way.     Now     the universities are filling in their foggy thinking with solid academic     information on how the new process actually works.   The new system     may be running at the edge of Chaos, but it is now workable as a plan.   Today we must succeed spectacularly with a breakthrough idea, called a     Black Swan, because breakthroughs are the new norm.   Running hundreds     of small projects that win small or fail fast is now understood as the     plan of action     Plan >> Do >> Test >> Learn >>     Repeat --.   You never risk more than you can afford to lose and the     emphasis is always on Do. You are antifragile, not hurt by uncertainty,     you prosper from it.   It is your persistence in repetition that makes     sure you are there when a Black Swan wins.   There are now so many Black Swans in play that they have become the defining     concept of the 21st century.   Historically science fiction generated the vision that lead to Apollo     to the Moon and solutions of many other problems of we the people of Earth.       Current blockbuster movies do not do this, perhaps they cannot.   Fortunately     there is a new democratic movement on the Internet that I think can.   Yes, there are problems.   Chiefly resources spent on space exploration     are not available for working other real world problems.   This is     why programs must be widely appreciated before major resources can be applied.  We can organize to generate our vision.   We can tell the story before     the adventure happens and by so doing make the adventure happen.         The process will require diverse teams of technical people to work out     the implications of current science and humanities people to work out the     language, dialog, and characters.   Modern social media on the Internet     can do this job very well.   We have started small with an e-book of science fiction short stories     called Hard Squared Science Fiction, Vol. 01 and have started Vol. 02.   We have a     working site in the social knowledge site, So:Kno, under the title    Romancing     Black Swans    and are working up clear statements of why and how.

It can occur in any human activity.   In creative writing, authors described the state as the words flowing like a river, hence the name.   In music it is called being ""in the Groove"".   In sports it is ""in the Zone"".   Flow is a very enjoyable state of mind.Modern humans also have another mental state ""Buy-in"".   Under buy-in a person accepts and idea as his mission, gets in action on the idea, and stays in action on the idea.   Buy-in is the key to modern humans achieving projects.Buy-ins study is not as widely published as Flow, but you can get training in its use from a number of sources.   Both these states of mind are supported by modules in the human brain.   ;Pigments are needed for VisionIn Well's ""The invisible Man"" he makes a point of the cat's eyes being very difficult to make invisible.   This problem is far more basic than the author discusses.   Without colored eye pigments, you simply cannot see.   The Invisible man would be blind.   These pigments adsorb specific bands of light and convert the energy into nerve impulses.   If they were made clear, then there would be no conversion, no nerve impulses and no sight.;"

It's hard to put into words but  as an example:You wrote:Alice first sees her chess board to be played as she and the Red Queen reach the top of the hill.   Alice, while looking out at the countryside declares,    It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)You could say:Alice first comments on the game of chess when she looks out over the countryside and declares     It   s marked out just like a large chessboard.    (p.30)I'm not  entirely happy with my sentence but I hope you can see what I mean!The only other thing I'd say is that whilst your last paragraph draws comparisons with Harry Potter you don't really say why it is interesting that they both use chessboards - I think that you could have linked this back to your thesis and  explained  why the metaphor of the game of chess appears across different  children's  novels.;Since I've commented it seems only fair to share my own essay! I noticed the errors in the last sentence just  after the deadline to correct them passed :(Alice in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll (Overall Score 4)In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland the Mock Turtle is source of many linguistic puns. When Alice first hears about him ""[she doesn't] even know what a Mock Turtle is"" until the Queen educates her by saying that ""It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from"".   In Victorian England Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel's illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. Carroll makes a clever dual pun out of the Mock Turtle's name - it is both a play on the nature of the soup (which is pretending to be something it is not) and on the nature of the turtle (which literally embodies its peculiar name).As Alice continues talking with the Mock Turtle more puns are introduced - Mock Turtle discusses his school life (a topic to which the child reader can easily relate) and refers to master ""Tortoise"".   When Alice questions why a turtle would be called 'tortoise' she is informed that is is because he ""taught us"" - this is an example of a homophone, a device which Carroll uses throughout the novel for comedic effect. The chapter continues with puns on school topics, for example ""Reeling"" and ""Writhing"" replace ""Reading"" and ""Writing"". The puns in Alice in Wonderland are fairly obvious and are often expressly identified by the characters in the book - this is interesting as it shows us that Carroll was writing carefully for his intended audience.   If the child reader misses the wordplay it is brought to their attention and if they identified it themselves then they gain a sense of achievement for spotting it before the characters did.   In this way Alice's adventures are both amuse the young reader and a encourage them to think carefully about language and inspire them to use it creatively.Form - 2peer 1     So glad to see someone really enjoying the sad tales from the Mock Turtle episode and your including your research in a clear, concise way is also remarkable.peer 2     The student uses form and grammar correctly but some areas need commas in certain places and attention to details on various articles that are used. For example, In the first sentence, In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,(comma) the Mock Turtle is (a)source of many linguistic puns. Also, in this sentence, In Victorian England, (comma) Mock Turtle Soup used the head and hooves of a calf to imitate turtle meat and in Tenniel's illustration the Mock Turtle has the head and feet of a calf but the body of a turtle. There are a few misspelled words and articles that are used twice. Possibly proofreading and having someone else read for you would make it perfect.peer 3     The structure of your essay was smooth and the progression was logical but there were some errors in your final sentence. Make sure to proofread carefully because these are easy to avoid.peer 4     You write well and you laid out a clear argument.Content - 2peer 1     Content offers insightful analysis and some research, thank you!peer 2     The content of the essay is great! I learned quite a bit from this essay. I would suggest to put the 3rd paragraph first but otherwise this student is on the right track. One thing I learned is that reading this book is interesting because of the puns that are used.peer 3     I enjoyed how specific the focus of your essay was but I would caution against using Wikipedia as a source since it can be easily altered.

Can anyone point me to any quotes from the book which support the assertions the writer of the essay has made?   My thoughts are thus:Whilst Dracula's entry to the asylum is facilitated by an invitation he is also shown to be able to circumvent the necessity for an invitation. Dracula uses a wolf to break into Lucy's bedroom through her window and I'm not sure why he would do this if he had been invited into the house previously?I can also find no reference to the women being willing in the text. Dracula comes to Mina when she is drugged with a sleeping draught and threatens her with the death of her husband if she dares resist him and is said to be restraining  her as he feeds - to my mind this does not indicate 'willingness'!Having said that - I'd love to be proven wrong!;Ah, perfect - thank you.   I guess the wolf-through-the-window must have been to circumvent the garlic protections and that Lucy must have invited him into the house at some point previously.I very much appreciate you taking the time to point out the quote to me.;"

I'll be sure to use it.  ;thanks :);Here's what I got on this: ....On page 208, Van Helsing says this to Dr. Seward :     ...we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe.   I think the ""little bit of truth"" and ""small truth""   is science and ""big truth""   and ""all the truth in the universe"" is religion. Acknowledge the truth of science but believe in the truth of religion.  He also says:  ""I want you to believe...to believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith,    that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.""Here I think the word ""know"" refers to our scientific knowledge. By scientific knowledge, we ""know"" certain things to be untrue. But faith lets us believe these untrue things because faith does not require scientific knowledge.  Stoker obviously values science and see the importance of it. But he also seems heavily religious and stresses the importance of having faith. Both are true, but one is a bigger truth than the other; one encompasses the other.  ;I just thought of this and wondered if its valid or means anything.  Jesus was killed, he descended into Hell, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven.

Although Dr. Frankenstein created life in a pale imitation of God, he is not a God and will never be able to do what He does. God created a wife for Adam that loves him. God can make that guarantee of requited love while Dr. Frankenstein can not.  Like God, Dr. Frankenstein has responsibility over his creation. Unlike God, Dr. Frankenstein is unable to meet them.

Having said that, I won't allow it to influence my decision to try and take everything I can out of the course. Of course, not every critique is helpful - as an aspiring writer who participates in online writing groups I know that all too well - but not venturing out there to see if maybe something constructive comes my way too seems even less productive.Not trying to persuade, just my opinion;I assumed that the essays are graded independently by staff at the university and that we are only grading them as an exercise to give us practice at critically evaluating people's responses to the texts. It would seem odd if the final grade was influenced by the feedback that students would give other students and that this is used to measure our participation in the course and it is taken into consideration for the final grade in that way. I don't consider myself qualified to ""mark"" other people's work in a way that contribute to their final grade so I can't see the grades we give other students to be part of it. It would be better if it was clarified though to avoid confusion. ;Katrina, I understand your issue with the grading and I respect your issues with it. This situation reminds me of an issue I've had in my own courses when trying (forcing?) students to understand the benefits of peer review. The ideal is that students, when acting as reviewers, learn to become better critics of ideas and their own writing by having something more tangible than participation points at stake. When my students felt they were being held accountable by other students for their own grades and were accountable for the grades they gave others, they handled peer review with a new sense of seriousness and purpose. Further, my students reported that it made them feel like they were actually contributing to knowledge both on content and form by helping their peers. They began to see themselves as part of a scholarly community Instead of feeling like high schoolers being given inane tasks to complete. It helped them refine their scholarly voices and gain security in the fact that they could (and needed to!) provide thought-provoking and critical analysis to their peers - a skill necessary both in the classroom, on blog posts/forums, and in the greater community while in the workplace or over a beer. I've interpreted Prof. Rabkin's grading criteria in light of these experiences in my own classroom. It's not the most ideal situation to base a course ""grade"" on only peer-reviewed material, but I think it helps develop the scholarly community he's aiming for given the skills he wants us to have at the end of the course. With your Mythology course, I wonder what would stop a ""robot"" to be built that fills in all the blanks with Lorem Ipsum instead of a real, flesh student writing critically on the assigned materials? While there could be a system implemented where reviewers ""flag"" posts like that, if I, as a student, saw multiple ones like that in the span of the course, I'd start questioning the legitimacy of the course and Coursera as a medium. (not to say I've seen this happen, but just to pose a hypothetical). I look forward to your thoughts on this as a fellow educator!;As a fellow teacher, encouraging students to take this course, that is also my take Danielle. Professor explained very well what was required and how it will improve the skill set of all students taking this course.  ;Yeah, I think you are raising a fair point, Katrina. I had similar concerns (along the lines of ""would students know what they're doing?"") the first time I came across it here on Coursera, but so far I have nothing but good experiences with it. A professor in another course said that after looking through the results from a previous version of his course, it turned out that students mark each other very similarly to what he himself would have done.This being said, you, or anyone else, should certainly bring it up again if the feedback you're getting is unfair. :);(N.B. I am not a teacher nor a professional of any stripe - below are just my personal experiences.)I too was concerned about peer review when I first found coursera. It makes practical sense to use it, thanks to the huge enrollment numbers, and I'm sure in the aggregate, the peer review grades average out to something fair.In the previous class I've taken (Dr. Hagen's fantastic AIDS course) I found that my final grade accurately reflected my work as a whole. That said, there were a few essays where the peer reviewers took off points, and then could not comment coherently as to why.  In the case of one particular essay, it was obvious that my word choices had outstripped the knowledge of three different non-native English speakers; all three left comments that demonstrated they either hadn't read, or hadn't understood my essay. I felt bad about the misunderstanding; I respect anyone who has the drive to take a class in a second (third, fourth, etc) language! But at the same time, I was upset about essentially being ""punished"" for delving into the topic in greater depth. I found myself writing with very simple language and striving to make my points blatantly obvious (and not in a good way - things like literally writing ""The first statement significant to me is.... the second statement significant to me is...."") for the rest of the course, so as to not find myself penalized due to a peer's difficulties in reading English.Even with that, one person whose English was perfect docked a later essay for ""not having a thesis or conclusion."" Fair enough, except, since this was after I'd already decided to break out the sledgehammer and abandon all subtleties, the essay in question included blinking neon signs in the form of that awful phrase, ""I will argue that A, B, C"" and the close second in terms of pedestrian tell-not-showing phrases, ""In conclusion...""I just might have had to walk away from the computer for several minutes the afternoon that review came back. And count to a hundred. And remind myself I was still going to get a very good grade, so it didn't matter much. But arrrrgh.But the grading system as a whole is not going to change, because it can't practicably use professors and TAs to grade however many thousand essays are at stake.Some advice, therefore, for my fellow peer reviewers, especially those whose written English skills are not very strong (you can be a native English speaker and still have difficulty with the written word - ask anyone who's dyslexic!):Read slowly and carefully.Read the whole essay. Then read it a second time. Make sure you understand what the writer is trying to say. (There was a lot of whining in the AIDS class that people just didn't have *time* to read *so many* (5) essays! I'm sympathetic to that, but if you don't have the time to evaluate your peers *carefully* - as carefully as you yourself would hope to be graded - then please, don't participate in the essay portion of the class.)If you don't understand what the writer is trying to say, ask yourself whether they are writing unclearly, or whether your reading comprehension might be the issue. If you are a non-native speaker, dyslexic, if you're *grading* someone who might be a non-native English speaker or dyslexic, or if you're in a rush despite yourself, you owe it to your classmates to be *especially* careful to make sure you haven't missed something. If a writer uses a word you don't know, look it up. If that sheds no light, ask on the boards... many people will be happy to help. Yo no hablo espa  ol bien en estos d _as, pero puedo leer lo suficientemente bien como para ayudar a los estudiantes que necesitan un poco de ayuda de la traducci _n. (hopefully I have conjugated that *mostly* correctly or my tio will be very disappointed with me! :) )By all means, critique - that is the point of this class, for learning cannot take place without criticism. But make sure it's ""attentive, intelligent"" criticism, to borrow from Prof. Rabkin. ""I didn't like this"" or ""you didn't do this well"" aren't helpful. ""I found the middle of your essay confusing because A doesn't seem to have much to do with B"" is a helpful comment. The same applies to ""good""... not helpful. ""I liked what you said about food meanings, it made me see the text in a different way."" That's helpful. You don't have to write a long or complicated comment to be helpful, just say something interesting. If you are a non-native speaker who finds commenting difficult in English, by all means, type your comment into google translate and paste the English translation into the comment box. I would rather get a very thoughtful comment in computer-translated English than a ""good"" or ""not good"" from a self conscious reviewer.And finally, just to reiterate, I have *profound* respect for the non-native English speakers taking this course. I could not take a course in Spanish or Irish (my two other languages) at this level and follow along. I also want to acknowledge that there are plenty of non-native English speakers out there whose English skills are better than mine - I tip my hat to you, too.If we all respect each other and do our best work (with reviewing as well as writing), everything will work out fine.;Katrina,I fully understand your reservations, believe me! I still share them - that's why I would *never* sign up for the signature track (which involves paying a significant amount of money to take the same class and have your grade considered certified and accredited) for a class like this. I simply don't trust the peer review system that much! I was just taking the opportunity on a thread about peer reviewing to elaborate on how those of us who *will* be participating in the peer review portion can do our best to be fair and informed toward our classmates. I completely respect your decision, and I wish there were easier ways for MOOCs like Coursera to deal with graded essays. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I don't think I would put nearly as much effort into a ""participation only"" essay as a graded one - in a classroom, as part of a for-credit course, I would, but for a free course that isn't for any credit, I would struggle to feel like the work I put in *meant* something if all I got at the end was a ""yeah, you typed something in the box.""I suspect that a peer review system is the best out of a bunch of not-great options for Coursera as a whole. Individual Coursera classes might have better options to fit that specific material - for example, in the AIDS class, we discussed the possibility of making a ""dual track"" available - one for people who didn't want to write essays/didn't feel comfortable with peer review, and one for people who wanted to write essays and/or didn't feel comfortable with quizzes being their only coursework. One of my other classes is quizzes only, and for that material, it works fine. Peer review that doesn't actually count for a grade would demotivate *me*, but that doesn't make it an invalid option. And so on.I certainly didn't feel like you were trying to tell the professor how to run his class. I've witnessed people *actually* doing that, and those people have never been as polite as you are. In addition to that, I've known a lot of educators in my life (my mother is a school bus driver and I've worked as an informal paraprofessional in special ed classrooms off and on for many years, as our district is chronically shorthanded in that area), and I know no educator who would think of doing such a thing!So, no worries. Your point of view is well taken and was well expressed. Don't worry about the rude commenters - such is the way of the internet. Enjoy the class!;One of Vertigo's tamer series and I still love it. Personally Jack of Fables is my favourite, his personality straddles the line between the darker and lighter side of fairy tales.  ;I've read a bunch of them, and really love them. Along with Sondheim's Into the Woods, Fables is among my favorite ""fractured fairy tales.""I just recently mentioned them on my blog.  http://stackedshelves.blogspot.com/2013_04_01_archive.html;I used to read them, I guess I read until issue number 80 or so. It's a wonderful comic series but very hard to find in Mexico.  ;I Katrina. What I'd like to know is what stories do we have to read for next week....there's a LOT of them.I used that website to learn Danish, you can have the same tale written in two different language one besides the other, so you can compare them.By the way, I remember your name, but I am not sure from which course...Greek Mythology?;I see that we've got a GoodReads group, so I created one for LibraryThing too:http://www.librarything.com/groups/fantasyandscienceficAnd here's my (woefully incomplete) profile there:http://www.librarything.com/profile/nadyne.richmond;Hello, here goes my (rather incomplete) list:Movies (in no particular order):  -SF:MatrixAnimatrixAvalonDonnie DarkoAkira12 Monkeys  -Fantasy:Spirited Away.Princess Mononoke.Nausicaa.Howl's Moving Castle.LOTR The two towers.About TV series I think I do not know a lot but as more people bring them up, I'll remember them. Neon Genesis Evangelion would be there, as well as Last Exile and Gundam Wing. Game of Thrones would also appear on my list.;I haven't read the book (which I hope to find soon), butI particularly like what Studo Ghibli does, although anime as a general rule is not what I most like, I saw a fair share some years ago, but it gets repetitive quickly, except for Ghibli's productions.I never saw Firefly, I could only get the movie, Serenity, which I enjoyed. About the Neverending Story... I'm such a shame hehe I have never watched it.Regarding books, have you read anything within Orson Scott Card's Enderverse? I'm looking forward to Ender's Game movie this year.;Carolyn, On a side note, I noticed that you have Blade Runner on your list and thought worth mentioning that the movie was loosely based on a novel called 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote another book called 'A Scanner Darkly' witch was made into a moderately successful animated movie.;For anime, try Samurai Champloo if you've not seen it. And I'll always love Avatar: The Last Airbender (the cartoon, NOT the awful movie). That was a quality show. ;You should totally watch Doctor Who. You can start with the new stuff (Christopher Eccleston), no need to go back to the very first season if you don't want to. It's really good. ;To me, It always felt a bit incomplete.;I also love Game of Thrones, read all the books (currently written at the time) and then reread them when the HBO show came out (by the way, I'm so happy with this show: it is one of the better, if not the best, adaptations I've seen).I think all of your comments are really well made. The characterization is amazing for me, brought to life because of how Martin writes the narrative. The story is like a game of Risk, where certain ""colors"" or families win some, then lose some, with each consecutive roll of the dice, but they all have the same goal. I, of course, love all of the core characters, but there are many minor characters that I wish Martin would have latched on to and written in as one of the narrative characters because I want to learn so much more about them.;"

Especially those which are older. I like Grimm's stories and folktales in general: they are amusing, there is implicit wisdom in them, but they are too contradictory to be a guide. You should already have some views upon the world to discriminate between right and wrong.I appreciate folktales but prefer authored stories. I like to meet a personal position. And I'm too modern: I need a logically consistent plot. :D;This is interesting. I also had the thought that perhaps the step-mother is often wicked/evil in these stories because divorce was not as common as it is in certain areas of the world today, so a step-mother often meant that your biological mother was dead. This may add an extra layer to the reason for not-so-nice step-mothers, a further psychological aspect. In some of the stories this is explicitly stated - Aschenputtel's mother is dead, for instance. She goes to visit her grave every day and she also plants the hazel-stick there. I am wondering, in other tales where there is a step-mother but it is not explicitly mentioned that the biological mother has died, if this was just assumed. Today, it is not uncommon to see families with single parents and/or step-parents from divorce. Back then, in Germany and other areas where these tales were prominent, my bet is that a step-parent only comes into the picture by a widow re-marrying (after the death of the first parent).  ;also don't be too concerned, you need a 1,8 average on your best assignments.If you submit anything, you'll get a minimum of 2... so the peer evaluations are really there for you to learn from and not to determine who passes the course.(i think that's correct - feel free to correct me on my math) :P;Katrina,I totally understand your point.   After reading some of the fb comments for this course from a previous class, I am even more concerned about being graded solely on peer reviews.   Comments (assumptions) were made about whether the writer was a native english speaker, differences in grammar/punctuation correction in each essay (this is incorrect, then they would change it to the recommended correctness, and that would be incorrect), to being graded down for taking a point that differed from the book (most common example was in Frankenstein when choosing the creator as the real monster).   Many in this class do not have any *real* instruction in grading, reviewing, etc. as most are not teachers, or going to school to become a teacher.   We also will run into the problem of *opinion* and we all know the saying about that.   It doesn't seem equitable that our grade is figured from the peer reviews themselves.   It is also ambiguous because the instructor states in the video that if you do all 10 essays you will have an A.   Not true because if you score low on the essays you will not.   Especially since ""rarely"" should there be a 3, which would, imho, classify as an A.   2, imho, would revert to a B/C, and a 1 an F.   I would more think that since this a pass/fail (which does not mean that we should ""chill"" and not be concerned about grades...yes, we are doing this for our enrichment, but many of us still care deeply about the grade)that doing the assignments appropriately and turning them all in, doing your peer reviews, etc should garner your grade, not the reviews themselves.;Thanks, Katrina. That's nice of you to say.;Fables is amazing.   Also interesting to note that the fables in this incarnation retain their power to some extent by force of belief,   This goes right with the reading of Grimm and why they remain so prominent.   It is not just that the stories are that good, but that since so many have heard them, they gain force by shear prevalence.   (Which is also the theme of another comic/graphic novel, Unwritten.);What bums me out is when I try to introduce people to those particular comics and I'm written off because comics are just Superheroes right? Gah. Comics and Graphic Novels are a legit literary genre, in my opinion. Most comics aren't really meant for children. If I had a child, I wouldn't let them read some of the things I've picked up until they were a bit older.  ;Exactly.  People who think comics are for children just do not know.  Maus and Watcmen both garnered their creators Pulitzers.  It is inventive literature.  Some of the most forward thinking writing is in graphic format.  McLuhan is wrong.  Media is not the message.   ;I'm with you, Katrina!   The Black Cauldron was one of the rare movies I saw multiple times in the theater and it led me to check out The Prydain Chronicles from the school library to get Taran's whole story.   This was when they were still in individual books.   I later bought the compilation from The Science Fiction Book Club some years later.Titan A.E. is one of my favorite animated movies as well.   Don Bluth animated the game Dragon's Lair (and others) and I like his style.   The story is fairly cliche, but not overly so.   The bleak human future is an unpopular setting to many because it's ""our team"" that's losing.   I can see how the common mind would chafe on that.   I like the ""overcoming adversity"" stories.   The worse the conditions, the sweeter the victory.One final observation:   Both of those movies do well with me because neither of them were made with any ""sing along"" songs.   Name another Disney animated movie that doesn't have any songs in it.   I can't think of any.   Yes Titan A.E. had some rockin' soundtracks, but the characters weren't yippy-skippying about vocalizing their feelings in harmony.   Yeesh.;It's really iteresting to see the similarities between fairy tales in different times and places, definitely what one could call ""collective consciousness"", this also works for myths and legends.;Tyrion is my favorite. Who doesn't love him? But I also really like Jorah and Daenerys both. I'm not too fond of any of the Stark kids, but I did love Ned Stark.;Besides Grimm, Dracula, and Oedipus for another course, I'm reading The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth, and Drama by Lord Raglan, and I'm rereading Isabel Allende's House of the Spirits because I want to propose a unit plan to teach that book next year.;Grimm's Fairy Tales!!

Little Red Riding Hood!Source:   http://mathieubeaulieu.deviantart.com/art/Wolves-Bus-ride-9906903Even though it's meant to be an amusing cartoon (which it is!)

The second one is, I believe, by Kay Nielsen.Her Rumpelstiltskin is very popular:Kay Nielsen:  http://50watts.com/Golden-Age-Illustrator-Kay-NielsenAnother great illustrator of the tales: Warwick Goble. Here's one of Snow White:;I understand all of the points brought up...but what is the alternative? Censorship? We've come so far in this area, I do not want to go backwards. It's wrong to think that an issue will go away just by avoiding it. I mean, ignorance may really be bliss, but I'd rather be knowledgable.  Please remember that most of us on this course are adults or if not, we're mature enough to know not to go around repeating offensive words or actions just because we read them in a book. If it really bothers you that much, try to keep in mind that they are fantasy and sci-fi works. Yes, they may include reflections of real society and ways of life, but if you don't want to focus on that in order to feel less 'uncomfortable' you can opt not to.;The children were the prince's. In my version Maria Tatar wrote:  Rapunzel becomes a ""wife"" because the Grimms did not want to suggest that Rapunzel's twins were born out of wedlock.She is referring to the passage where the witch says to the prince: ""You want to come get your darling little wife, but the beautiful bird is no longer sitting in the nest, singing her songs."";The version I have is The Annotated Brothers Grimm:http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Brothers-Grimm-Bicentennial-Edition/dp/0393088863/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8...;See, I read this in a different way. To me, the witch or enchantress had purposely put the delicious looking rapunzel in the garden so that the woman would see it and crave it. Perhaps she even put a spell on the rapunzel because it had such a powerful impact on the woman: ""she began to waste away because she was afraid she would never get any of it."" Since the woman had just gotten pregnant, I felt that the witch (who is also called a fairy in some other versions) was playing on the cravings that pregnant women might get and purposely making the rapunzel look so appetizing, and then, of course, making it taste so good.;I love how there are so many different interpretations to these tales. It makes for some interesting and insightful conversations.  Peter: You may think that the witch was not cruel to Rapunzel, but how much more cruel can you be locking a child up in a tower? That's imprisonment! For doing absolutely nothing; her freedom is taken from her for the sins of her parents. There is a prison in Philadelphia called the Eastern State Penitentiary in which prisoners were kept in solitary confinement so as to reflect on their sins and hopefully, repent. In reality, many of them went insane because of the lack of human contact. The prison reformed a number of times over the years and finally shut down in the 1970s. John Graham also brought up a great point about real children being raised in captivity. It is horrible, and if you ask me, the witch got off too easy for doing that to Rapunzel in the first place.  There are many different versions of the story of Medusa, too, but it's interesting that you brought her up. One version said that she boasted about her beauty too much so Athena punished her vanity by taking that beauty away. Another version said that she seduced Poseidon in Athena's temple, and finally there's the version that she was raped in Athena's temple; either way she was turned into a gorgon by Athena. With this story, it is often argued that had Medusa not been in the temple, the punishment would have been a lot less severe (if there was a punishment at all). Athena was not angry about the coupling, she was angry that it happened in her temple (being a virgin goddess and all). One of the main warnings in this myth is to not defile sacred sites...which differs somewhat from Rapunzel, but I do see the connection. Good thinking.;Peter,You are right about that particular rape victim version of the story, but that is not one of the older versions of Medusa. It is actually one of the new versions, coming with Ovid. Sorry to correct you on this, but I did a report on Medusa so I have studied her a lot.   : /    Actually, the oldest version of Medusa's name having showed up is one in which she was never human, but a sister of Stheno and Euryale, one of the daughters of Phorcys and Keto/Ceto. Medusa was the only mortal one in the trio, and thus, able to be killed by Perseus. Again, as with all Greek myths, there are many variations, more than I have described.  I do see what you mean about a protected treasure, but that is just what I am trying to point out. By 'protecting' a child from the world, it's like you're treating her as a piece of property, hoarding an object, like Gollum with his precious ring. That is a very sinister thing to do to a human being. Not only would you stunt the mind of a child, but probably the health and growth by locking them away in such a manner. If you don't doom them outright to insanity, as I said earlier. How is that okay? How will a child raised in such a way ever be able to function in the real world? How much have they missed being shut away their whole life? It's almost on par with abortion.;L. Frank Baum and Mark Twain from posting some of my children's writing. Love both, so I'm happy.;"

They wanted to foster a sense of unity. I don't think the Professor was harsh at all. It is only because you know about Nazi Germany that you're looking back at that way. But if the Professor said the same things and the Nazis had never come to power, you would not be thinking along these lines.And yeah, there were tons of countries at this time, before, and after that also wanted nationalism for their country.  ;You must read the annotated version if you do not think that Alice is absolutely brilliant (and a whole heck of a lot of fun to boot)! Martin Gardner, in the Introduction to my annotated book writes: ""The fact is that Carroll's nonsense is not nearly as random and pointless as it seems to a modern American child who tries to read the Alice books."" There are many, MANY inside jokes that we don't get as readers from a different time, culture, and even academic level. Carroll was most certainly an interesting fellow, for a variety of reasons, but one thing is certain: he ""was a skilled storyteller."" The numerous interpretations, studies, analyses, and general interest in his work by thousands of people prove that, if nothing else.;Suzanne,I think you should really take what most people are saying on here into consideration. I am curious as to what other classic literature you have read. Have you read any Shakespeare? Steinbeck? Jonathan Swift? How about any of the Arabian tales? Greek, Egyptian, or Norse myths? Chinese myths? One could argue that a lot of the timeless literature is riddled with violence; much more than you see in the fairy tales.I have read every book or story that is required for this course except for Herland. And, everyone else above is absolutely right. These tales are tame compared to some of what we will be delving into. If you are outraged now, you will blow your top soon. I respect your feelings, but urge you that if you are not yet ready to study these works seriously despite all of the violence, you might want to reconsider taking this course when and if you are.As for me, I am more outraged when I turn on the news than at any other time. Perhaps our own contemporary world would be less violent today if it could learn from the past violence in history and even in fictional literature.On a lighter note (and hopefully to make you laugh a little) I read and loved the Grimm fairy tales, as well as Andersen's tales, too, when I was a child. And they were not the watered down versions, but from an old series of my grandmothers (not sure if it was Lucy Crane or not). I never had any nightmares about them that I recall. You want to know what terrified me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I had a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh bear that I slept with (and still do, but shhh, don't tell anyone) and I dreamed that the Turtles kidnapped me and Pooh and hid him in a hole somewhere in the sewer. I still can remember vividly the horrifying experience of my dream where I was running through the sewer looking for Pooh, trying to be quiet and not scream when I stepped on rats as big as Splinter so that I didn't alert the Turtles. Go ahead and laugh at this, or at least smile, but that dream really did scare me half to death when I was younger.;This letterplay is straight from my annotated version: Notice the number of letters in each name, and the two double consonant sets (and where they are placed) in the surnames.Alice LiddellLewis CarrollAlso, Dear Lewis Carroll have the initials DLC which are CLD backwards, the initials for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. Fun!;Most of the times, I would prefer the books. Poor Alan Moore's incredible works were made into awful movies. I was so sad that Stardust by Neil Gaiman was not such a great movie either (I would have loved it if they made an animated movie in de Lint style).  Sometimes, though, I can really enjoy both the movies and the books, separately and as variations of each other. For instance, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (so far) are really well done in film form, but there is a lot that is missing from the books (understandably) so I can enjoy both as separate works of art and know that one was inspired by the other. Another example, though a show, is HBO's Game of Thrones.  I was a collector of Spider-Man comics as a young girl and I was thrilled to see the first movie and how it was reinvented, though inspired, by the original story line.  I have yet to see Gatsby, though I am the only English teacher you will probably meet who doesn't enjoy this book in the first place....and I, too, am nervous about Ender's Game.;My cousin is a dancer and was just in a professional ballet production of Dracula. It was really stunning and sinister and spooky. I loved every minute of it. Although I despise Twilight and the many imitations, the original Dracula book is very intriguing and entertaining to read.;This is rather a tough question. It completely depends on the book. Some stories are told better in the first person while others are told better in third person limited or third person omniscient.  ;I think it's especially interesting because the word 'mad' has so many different definitions, many of which can apply to Alice and the other Wonderland characters at different times.;Well, I loved Alice when I was younger and still do today. The Annotated Alice is extremely helpful and enriched my experience as a reader.I also love everything about Sandman, and I never thought about it before, but it is quite similar to Alice. Perhaps you didn't just get all the little inside jokes in Alice because it wasn't your time or culture...that's why the Annotated version is really helpful.I also loved the dream sequence in Dumbo and the one in Winnie-the-Pooh (the Heffalumps and Woozles). They are so colorful and fun. Maybe I'm just weird, but I've always loved fantasy sequences like that. I mean, this is a Fantasy/Sci-Fi course after all.;Florencia is absolutely right. Bear in mind, that you are reading his journal, not his thoughts. So, he is writing as a reflection back on what he just went through. Of course he is going to have stereotypical descriptions, as he can only take in, remember, and record so much information, so it's the stuff that appears most often and the stuff that has the largest impact on his mind that he writes down.As for the gay references...where are they? Are you talking about Mina and Lucy? But it seems you've not gotten to them yet? Are you talking about how Harker is studying Dracula so obsessively?;Bram Stoker never visited Transylvania and the geography described in Dracula is not always accurate. He did consult books, but I always read his Transylvania as a fictional place that is only loosely based on the real. He obviously could not have described the country people completely accurately, and only used them as minor characters anyway to set the tone (often such minor characters are stereotypical anyway).Carmen, I do believe you are looking for something that is not quite there. Yes, many English/European writers could be biased and downright racist at times, but Bram Stoker was Irish. He was rather appalled at English oppression because of that fact. Javier is absolutely right about the differences between doctors and peasants (after all, education comes into play here) and if you keep reading, you will find some English characters that are not so gentlemanly. So, I doubt there is any type of racism there.;Well, I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have seen some wonderfully insightful posts in the forums and some that...aren't so wonderfully insightful, but it shows that people are thinking in any case! I know a lot of the students enrolled are not active on the forums, but perhaps there are some that are not putting their full effort into the essays for a variety of reasons. Hopefully you will see improvements next week!;Well, the books do not seem that ancient to me, but that's probably because I'm also in the middle of a Greek and Roman Mythology course. I agree with both Megan and Amber: The required texts are not all that old and it's nice to have as many of them as possible in the public domain. I think the choices were also made on the basis of how much of an impact the texts had on both the genre, and on people/history in general. Most of the titles are recognizable, and a lot of the students on here have read some or most of the works already, meaning they are important to the genre as a whole, and have influenced readers, writers, and scholars alike.;"

He was indeed Irish, and as you might assume, didn't look favorably on the English as a general rule. Dracula has been interpreted as a satirical text in which Stoker is actually pointing out how the English are frightened of outsiders and outside influence. He goes so far to make them seem horrified by it. There is also an interpretation that Dracula was a metaphor for England as a whole, ""sucking the blood out of people"" just because he could. How accurate these views are is debatable, but it does rather put one off the view of his holding the English higher than any other culture. There is no doubt that he did not accurately describe Transylvania and his inhabitants, as has already been said, but again, other than Dracula (and his women) the Transylvanians were minor characters, meant to add drama and a spooky atmosphere. Many writers make their similar minor characters stereotypical for just that same reason: to create a certain type of atmosphere. ;)  ;It is most acceptable in an academic setting to not use the word ""I"" or ""me"" in an essay. You should not be writing your personal opinion like this: ""I didn't like it very much because...."" but should be more assertive by writing something like this: ""Although this is considered a classic work of literature, there are many flaws, such as....""Hopefully that makes sense.;This is not necessarily true, Paul. I teach English and there is a very powerful urge to get students writing professionally. My teacher training required that students are taught how to write an essay with a strong thesis in the third person. In all of my college level classes (both graduate and undergrad) it was not acceptable to write an academic paper (analysis or essay) in the first person. It was only used in creative writing assignments.  ;https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=193;I love Mel Brooks. Have you ever seen Young Frankenstein? A Dracula movie by him would be great. Though, I'm not certain I get all of your song titles... : /;I completely agree with Anna. Looking critically at any text should not take the magic out of it but should add a deeper level of understanding. Alice in Wonderland, for example, seems to have frustrated a lot of people on this forum, but I think the main reason for that is because they did not understand the multiple layers of the literature. I think a lot of people had this notion that it was a children's book and went into the reading thinking it was going to be 'easy' or 'whimsical' when it really takes a sharp mind, some research, and some higher order thinking to fully enjoy the brilliance of the work.  When it comes to creative writing, I have found that all of my literature classes have really intensified my own writing. I don't always write with lots of symbols in mind, or try to include subtle hints about themes in my work, but sometimes I do. A lot of times, I just want to write a fun story with lots of swashbuckling and sword play. Other times, I am in my poetic mood and my writing is much more literary. Either way, reading, analyzing, and discussing other books has greatly improved my own writing. I have found that when I plan a new story, I can jot down a few themes I might want to include and find that I have added many more when I get through it, without even realizing I was doing so. However, I always think to myself that I want my readers to be entertained first, and if my work has informed them about something, inspired them to create something, or made them think deeply about something, that is a bonus.;"

It was amazing that I opened the Wall Street Journal today and spotted a review on   Who Was Dracula? by Jim Steinmeyer. All of you interested in Stoker's relationship with Wilde and Whitman and Irving would probably like to read this book.  Here's a link to an online review:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578553403814447228.htmlPerhaps the best quote from the review is:""The open-endedness of Stoker's characterization makes it easy for each successive generation to reinvent Dracula according to its own preoccupations."" Certainly we, as contemporary readers are finding things in the book that readers a century ago or even fifty years ago didn't find, of it they did, would never have discussed in public. This ability of Dracula  to affect a wide variety of readers throughout many generations is just one testament to its literary worth.  The same can be said, I think, of many great classic novels.  ;Great idea for a thread, Kristine. I am not participating in the essay portion of this course, but I have been dismayed at all the issues people are having over the peer reviews. I am sincerely sorry that there is so much consternation over them.  I have read everything we've been assigned to read so far, but I am reading it all again and really loving some of the discussions on here about the literature. The lectures are informative, but a little slow-moving for me. I don't know why, but I can only watch a couple at a time and I am not through all of the Dracula ones yet. But I am just going through the course at my own pace.Despite all of the 'I hate this book' comments, I think there have been some great insights on the forums. I have particularly enjoyed some of the discussions about Dracula. I think it's wonderful that people of all different ages and from different cultures can find so many similarities in the works (some 'universal truths' if you will). But it is also fascinating to see how original ideas pop up and how many of us have differing views about a piece. Keep up the great discussions, Courserians!;Greek and Roman Mythology if you're interested. You must write one essay (but you can write two if you choose throughout the course).

Sustainable Earth -- These are stories about people addressing ecological problems.   We currently have a complex story idea based on a series of TED presentations (space need not be mentioned).3.   First Contact -- Stories about what it would mean to humans to contact star people.   We how have three stories in this series, but the next one needs to be written from the point of view of a porpoise.In each case, the idea is to make the stories about character as much as the technical situations they are in.Please let me know if you would like a review copy of any of these story by email (yet more reading.)If you have story ideas the might fit our general theme (solving the porlbmes of the 21st century), please let me know..   I would be happy to review them as we need collaboratorsI would also be happy to review your short essays for this course.   Each of the stories in our project is supported by a short technical essay, so this should be good practice.Thanks for you interest,Tom Riley;"

I hope you had a back-up stored somewhere or you have sublimed.;Some very interesting observations here. The thing that jumps out of the pages when I read the TOG series is Martin's diction. Open any book on any page and notice the word choice. Particularly when he is describing a scene or segueing from one event to another. Walking down alleys or across a corridor in a castle the words have a tendency to build up and reinforce a particular colour or image. If he is talking about gold there will be references to candle or sunlight immediately afterwards, if he has written about a sword the word choices will have a quality of sharpness to them in the ensuing sentences.     Yes his ability to create believable and human characters in a fantasy world is remarkable. How does a man in his sixties convincingly write from the perspective of a young girl for example? I feel that this is one of the toughest challenges in writing. This particularly holds true when writing science fiction as there are often times when the writer is faced with the task of creating characters whose frame of reference is completely alien. If anyone has any thoughts on how to achieve this I would be very much appreciative of your input during the course. But truly what makes his books come alive for me is his ability to weave words into a visceral image that drags you into the scene. Consider the title; 'A song of Ice and Fire'. How primal an image and how expertly this image is reflects the counterpoint and harmony between the characters. Both substances give life in moderation and destroy it in excess. Just as his characters are neither truly good nor evil, merely caught up in a twist of fate. A song of Ice and fire.        ;"

What about novels such as Stephen King's ""The Stand"", decimation due to a virus escaping from a secret lab? Or an old school movie such as ""Terminator"" in which computers take over the world? It seems as if both are saturated with possibilities related to human creation and exploration based on scientific advances and peoples fears of them. The chance the advancements occuring would destroy the world as we know it is a strong theme in many stories. Right now there is a strong focus on viruses. Terrorist activities still abound in writing, TV shows and movies. What else is happening and/or advancing that will generate books, movies and TV shows? ;Wait, what? ""Night Watch"" _Pentalogy_?

Surely it would be better to number them in order (1-5) as you go along.;Overall Grade: 4.5The Grimm Brothers: Growth and Fertility Many themes are presented throughout the Grimm Brothers tales. Coming  of age is one, where transitions of womanhood and the beginnings of  fertility are represented. With this comes loss of innocence and leaving  behind childhood. In the tale of Rapunzel, the fertility theme is presented  early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of rampion. When the  King   s son climbs through the window, Rapunzel is shocked as she comes  face-to-face with the first man she has ever laid eyes upon. Her coming  of age occurs when she accepts his hand in marriage, thus becoming his  wife and the bearer of his children. With Aschenputtel,  fertility is represented by the lentils that she must pick up. She is no  longer a child when the King   s son recognises her as his partner and  takes her for his wife. Sleeping Beauty dives deeper into the state of fertility,  with Rosamund pricking her finger. The blood from this is a symbol of  the medieval belief that a child becomes a woman when she begins  menstruation. In addition, Rosamund falls asleep as a child and wakes up  as a woman. The thorns surrounding the castle are an icon of growth and  serve as a cocoon until the 100 year curse is complete. Similar to this  is the tale of Snow White, where she falls asleep as a na  ve  child and wakes as a learned woman. In this example, the reader is made  aware early on of Snow White   s coming of age, as she becomes fairest of  all. The ripened apple acts as the symbol of fertility. The coming of age and happiness of these women depends upon their  attachments to a male and their social acculturation. This theme is  constant throughout these tales up until the end, where they cannot  remain or return home to their states as children.Works Cited: Rapunzel; Aschenputtel; Sleeping Beauty; Snow White - Grimm - Children's and Household Tales (Lucy Crane translation).FORM = 2peer 2      This student's grammar and punctuation are very good. Furthermore, the  student makes good use of the short word count by being direct and  concise. The only thing that could be improved is the thesis statement.  There is really no need to say that many themes are represented in  Grimm's tales because that's a given. Starting off with the same  directness as the rest of the essay would be beneficial. peer 3     the argument is very well written.peer 4      Form is very clear here, the argument is well laid out and the opening  statement is concise and relevant. Everything seemed carefully planned  and thought through.CONTENT = 2.5peer 1     The main thesis of ""fertility"", ""coming of age"" and ""loss of innocence"" etc. is excellent! peer 2      This student makes good observations about salient themes on the text.  However, because of the limited word count, it might have been  beneficial to concentrate on just one or two stories and add more  details about those.peer 4      1- The chosen topic is interesting, I like how you've explained the  blood or the apple as being symbols/metaphors.  2- If there is one thing I would mention, it would be that even though  your readers will most likely know what your referring to in this case,  some explanation might help, for instance why some symbols are  considered a sign of fertility. Or even how ""the fertility theme is  presented early, with Rapunzel   s mother longing to eat salads of  rampion."" maybe something as simple as (craving) would have explained  it.;Nope.

Often times, the ""heroine"" wins the day by being kind, sweet, but most importantly, beautiful, and that's about it. However, when I read these stories, I have a mindset that they are more like morality tales, almost like Aesop's Fables. No, they don't always have a moral at the end, but I can imagine parents telling their kids these tales to help teach them lessons to ""be good or else.""  That being said, I did enjoy some of them, including ""The Twelve Brothers, Robber Bridegroom, and The Fisherman and his Wife.""

Thanks.;I think the genre ""fairy tale"" contains various sub-genres.   Some of the Grimms' stories are definitely morality tales, in which the good are rewarded (usually after persevering through some trial) and the wicked are punished.

In that first peer review course we had a week to review, and it was a painstaking process for me. It's hard! I suddenly had a deep appreciation for all of the teachers in my life!  This process is a bit of a crap-shoot. You are going to have reviewers that don't put in much effort or much thought. But remember that there are plenty of reviewers out there who do.  I have been very fortunate with my reviewers. My first couple of essays came in as 4s with helpful commentary - all of which I agreed with. I actually scored a 6 on the Dracula essay and was shocked and very gratified. I had a lot of trouble trying to get this essay together and almost didn't submit one. I woke up on deadline morning, tried again and submitted with 1 hour and 14 minutes to go! But the score was not what brought me to tears - it was the comments. All of the comments were thoughtful and helpful and just made my heart soar (I'm sorry, but they really did!).So, for those of you who are having a less uplifting time, please hang in there! There are so many thoughtful, interesting people taking this class and you can see that from the Discussion Forums.

Part of me sighed and saw an 18-year old mentality in so many aspects of ""Frankenstein"", and yet:   These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.

At first, the changes are unpredictable, but after she has both sides of the mushroom, she is able to control and fine-tune her size for the later encounters.Very generally, the four settings are human size, small size (with small animals), tiny size (with the caterpillar), and large size. And this made me think of the races in Grimm's fairy tales: humans, dwarves, elves, and giants. If Grimm's folktales draw distinctions between peoples of different sizes with different names, what does it mean when a little girl can move from one size to another freely -- skipping across the borders between the mundane world and the fantastic world, with as little effort as the bite of a mushroom? (Food = knowledge? Mushroom --> pyschedelic, mind expanding, transcending planes of existence?)Any other thoughts on her changing of size, or on this parallel with the Grimm reading?;To answer your question ""Why aren't people more offended?"" all I can do is give you my personal perspective.I see that there are acts of violence and cruelty in Grimm's fairy tales. However, it never crossed my mind for a second that anything that happened within the pages was true. Certainly, if I had been under the impression that Grimm's fairy tales were a true history of actual events, I would be disturbed.The description of events was not very graphic, or visual. I find horror and slasher films to be much more traumatizing, which is why I choose not to watch them.Also, I understand that violent actions may be a symbol for something else. I imagine if a friend told me that they had a dream where they chopped my head off, I would be disturbed at first, but then I would say to myself, ""I don't think my friend  actually wants to chop my head off. I think it is symbolic of something else."" The imagery in folk tales is very dream-like, and should be read as such.That said, I understand how you feel. Often, when I listen to the news, I feel overwhelmed with all the terrible things that are happening in the world. Sometimes, I need to take a break from the news for a while. So I do, for a few days. Then I come back to it. It is more important to me to feel informed than to feel undisturbed, but I still need a break sometimes.I was once told, ""sensitivity  is a strength, too much sensitivity is a weakness.""

He begins as brutish and then transforms into a more well-spoken individual. (As a side note: Dr. Frankenstein has the opposite transformation: a young man of learning transforms, through grief, self-loathing, and misery, into a madman) The creature initially seems to be ""frustrated by its limitations,"" as you put it, and I assume it was from this early stage that the movie portrait was drawn. I think each version is well suited to its medium. In literature, well-spoken characters can more easily make their case, especially when dealing with complex subjects such as these, because the medium of literature is composed of words. Film, being a visual medium, can transmit a different sort of message, through the performances of the actors and other visuals, and therefore verbosity is not necessarily  required to convey the same ideas.;"

Honestly I tend to take things at face value.   I think these are stories told simply to be stories.   When a child asks a parent to tell them a bedtime story it is not  necessarily  wrought with symbolism(though some parents may have ulterior motives behind their stories) but sometimes just pure fantasy.   If and when there is symbolism to be found I think it is a  subconscious  factor.

Good point.;That Sci-fi, and other genres, can be used as a tool or even a technique of storytelling rather than a class of story in itself.I've always assumed that one of the major reasons for sci-fi/fantasy is that it's easier to deal with really tough issues by putting them into alternate realities, allowing us to explore the morality and ethics of situations and ways of being by dissociating them from the baggage they have in our world. SFF novels, series, films and comics have always held up a distorting mirror that weirdly provides a sharper, clearer image of our own behaviours. X-Men made huge points about how society treats minorities (and the fact that none of us actually fit all that neatly into the category of ""normal""); Sandman explored sex and gender identities and orientations explicitly, amongst many, many other issues; Watchmen showed up the awful logical outcomes of a world in which there really are superheroes; Star Trek routinely explored morality from the perspective of a society that had had to crawl back from nuclear holocaust and build an egalitarian, co-operative Utopia just to survive...  A friendly acquaintance and I got into a heated discussion about whether the technology in sci-fi should drive or serve the story. I'm a character-driven story fan (""The ship needs to be real because it's a backdrop for the people's stories!""); for him, the characters were secondary to descriptions of tech (""I don't care about the people - I want to know about the mechanics of the ship!""), and what it could do and how. In the end, he conceded that there needs to be a story to tell, or it'd just be a technical manual; I conceded that there was a whole chunk of geekdom that isn't fussed about characterisation, and that this was just fine.;Sometimes I think the difference (often blurred) between science fiction and fantasy is mainly in the need to explain the mechanisms; the how and the why rather than the consequences. For example, in fantasy we might accept dragons, elves or even FTL drives in a plot without needing to know their design principles; wheras in SF (excuse the abbrieve) we might want to understand how they were bred, evolved or researched. I see Star Wars as mostly fantasy with bits of SF but I think this too changed over the series. The 'force' was originally magic(al), but then became a heritable and selectable trait fuelled by mitochondrial-like organelles (!). In Dr Who (the early years) we had many 'what-if' fantasy stories where the science was an almost incidental and unknowable plot device; but that has increasingly given way to engineering and bio-engineering explanations of the fantasy 'tools' and players. Whereas older (pre-information-culture?) stories seemed to accept that special powers just happened or were given/awarded; nowadays SF (or at least a subset of it) requires a plausible scentific explanation ('origin-stories'?) before we can engage with the plot. Perhaps because we are generally more technologically knowledgable today as a society and we don't simply accept that things are unfathomable and we expect to know how they work?  Does this relate to the thread title? I think so - because we are generally much less easily awed. Given our exposure to so much media every day, much of which is scientific and a lot of which is itself pretty awesome (genomics, nanotech, LHC, robotics, synthetic biology); it takes quite a lot to surprise us. However, given the massive increase in publications and other SF/fantasy products now available compared to previous decades, the cumulative awe is probably greater now than it ever has been :) ;I think Carlos just simplified the debate and put a valid point forward. I fear we were diverging into the ""Let's define what Sci-fi is"" category.The more knowledgeable a reader is, the more detailed explanations must be in order for disbelief to be suspended. This causes writers to try more and more to put in detailed explanations, which in turn causes two things:1. The idea (or tech, or concept, whatever) that needed an explanation becomes less exaggerated and/or grand than first intended, as the writer struggles for internal consistency.2. The inherent 'wonder' that comes with the lack of a complete explanation is somewhat er... deflated.I mean, think about it. You're watching a magician perform, and you've already read the how-to manual. How 'awesome' would you feel the performance was? Even if the theatricality, the lighting etc was spot on, the fact that you already know how he does the damn thing makes it a little less impressive, even if it makes you feel a little more clever than the rest of the crowd.So the awesome isn't gone, but as Matthew so aptly said yesterday, ""Sci-fi could do with a little more fantasy once again.""I'm not suggesting we revert to soft sci-fi as in the 50s, (as it would cause a much shorter suspension of disbelief in today's time) but rather that a balance be found somewhere between. Give details to make the whole thing more believable, but let the wizard do it a couple of times.Call it taking a tricky stance, but why do I feel like I'm trying to talk between Kirk and Spock?;I love these.

The West Egg calculator estimates that $2400 in 1812 dollars would had the purchasing power of $31,919 in 2012 dollars.;That would be 626.75 cubic inches of volume, and the density of gold is 10.18 troy ounces per cubic inch.

The Science part of the Fiction seemed much more imaginative because of the abundance of problems yet to be solved.;I would argue that there's a strong difference between fictionalizing fantasy science, and actually creating new science.

He mostly does know how magic works (and a whole lot of other things), yet still enjoys watching somebody perform. He enjoys it because if it's done well enough, it can bring back his disbelief (in Magic, disbelief is a good thing) for a moment.It seems to me that it's okay to give as vague an explanation as to say that the method used to communicate instantly across the globe involves wires, or relays or something (clearly with a nod to the 50's). I think Sci-Fi absolutely could do with a little more fantasy, and a little less attempt at being Science itself. Sci-Fi is there to come up with the ideas, not the actual working technologies.;I, for one, am deterred by a book if the bulk of a sci-fi novel is filled with detailed descriptions of the technology. Tell me what I need to know to understand why it's important to the story - but more than that is just showing off.Yes, the author should have thought about it. In depth. That's part of the writer's job.  But - there are several authors I no longer read because, although their stories are interesting, they seem to be too invested in making sure the reader knows ""I did my research."" It bogs down a story for me....;In my view, the narrative, plot, characters and world-building is the entirety of a story. In Sci-Fi, the fictional (though often plausible) science is a part of each of those. The Narrative has to be done well enough that it isn't bogged down with too much information, but that it does adequately explain what's going on and tells its story. The Plot has to necessitate the technologies, or they become nothing but a gimmick for show. The Characters have a certain set of knowledge, which is sometimes expansive (Star Trek) and sometimes they know next to nothing (Philip K. Dick's writings usually); either way, they have to be able to express themselves through the story, and not be relegated to names and faces attached to a technical manual. The World-building seems most important of all; if you were to read a book like Snow Crash and the world-building was not done well enough, you would have nothing to visualize and might not understand the reasons for the technologies they are using. World-Building, in my view, is what happens when the other factors are done perfectly.;Well in six soldiers of fortune none of the men were of a particularly high social class, yet the leader was still lucky in the sense that he found comrades to help him and they were able to trick the king and become rich, but then again none of them were ""heros"" so maybe I'm wrong. Anyways, I think your thesis is insightful and I'm going to re-read all of the Tales and make sure I pay attention to the social hierarchy.;mmm... I think it could be a reflect of that era. I mean, fairy tales work as mirrows of the social status of women and men on those years.;Praduymn, hahah, your comment made me laugh, I like how you twisted the sense.  And I totally agree with you on the theatricality bit. The exact salary is of little importance, I believe. What matters is the descendent (Or is it descendant? sorry there) value of his possesions.  ;This is great! I was wondering why the frog didn't splat against the wall when it was thrown by the princess ...(using my high school physics f=ma  -- I was pretty sure that a frog wouldn't survive).;What happens to f=ma (force equals mass times  accelleration)  when the mass suddenly increases from a one-pound frog to a 150-pound prince?   If we hold the force constant, there's a rapid decelleration and he floats harmlessly to the ground. But if we hold the accellertion constant, there's a  150-fold increase in force and he probably does get splattered.;According to Wikipedia, the European common frog, rana temporaria, weighs 22.7g (0.8 ounces) on average, so I was overestimating by quite a bit. Let's imagine our prince to be five-foot-ten--tall for his time but not freakishly so--and of an ideal weight to be considered handsome and athletic. There are several models in use to determine ideal weight:The J.D. Robinson formula (52 kg + 1.9 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  156.5 lbsThe D.R. Miller formula (56.2 kg + 1.41 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  155.0 lbsThe B.J. Devine  formula (50.0kg + 2.3 kg per inch over 5 feet)  yields an  ideal weight of  160.9  lbsThe G.J. Hamwi formula (48.0 kg + 2.7 kg per inch over 5 feet) yields an ideal weight of  165.3 lbsI don't know which is best, so I will take an average: 159.4 lbs.  So turning from frog to prince has increased his mass by 3188 times. Let's just say he's about 3200 times more massive than before.How fast can a princess throw a frog weighing eight tenths of an ounce? I don't know, but women's fast-pitch softball throws can be clocked at up to 75 miles per hour. Granted, the princess is not a trained athlete, and a frog is not very aerodynamic, but the frog would weigh considerably less than a 6.25- to 7-ounce softball. Personally, I'd allow her a 25 to 30 mph frog-pitch.Splat!;I'd wager that the odds aren't actually in favor of my statement. I've had a similar level of entertainment at least twice within the past seven days, and I'm likely to have more within the next few. No matter how you define a week, this is likely just one of the most entertaining discussions I have/will seen/see this week.;I just wanna say, after this ends I'm voting that this thread gets an award. Best thread, Best discussion, Best procrastination,... whatever.;TVTropes. Yes, awesome resource. Been addicted to it for a year, now.About the Bride and Switch.Latent fear, perhaps? It could echo a fear of being cheated on and/or or made a fool of, within the context of wedlock?Or (perhaps I'm overreaching again) it could be a fear of not really knowing your bride-to-be very well, and only finding out her true colours (not very nice ones) after the wedding.Or, it might be an evolution of The Switch (not a trope per se, though it should be). As in, remember stories where the soon-to-be-killed hero would switch (or be switched) with another person/object? The story of Zeus and Cronos comes to mind. So, the Switch + The Unknown Bride = The Bride and Switch.Your post has got me thinking... Sure its a valid plot point, but why the constant recurrence? ;Hmmm... You're right. There seems to be more inside that cave. Time for some research.;""That technique means that every time you're rooting for one of your  favorite characters, you're probably rooting against another one you  love.""Well said.It makes it all the more dramatic AND realistic. In that way, its like watching your best friend and cousin fight each other...

I've always hated narratives that force you to try and sympathize with flat characters designated as the good guys.

Although I think I shall need to leave Gabriel Oak to his sheep until this course is over....I've not read much sci-fi, I confess. Well, aside from Douglas Adams, of course.  ;I have to disagree just a little. I think that the inclusion of a Faster Than Light technology, or any other as-yet nonexistent technologies pushes a story into what should rightly be called ""Science Fiction,"" and out of ""Fantasy."" I think that the difference comes in when you make the distinction between Technology, and Magic. Technology is something clearly made of human imaginations and ingenuity, whereas Magic is a property of the world around you. In the case of Star Wars, it seems to be predominantly a Fantasy Space-Opera. But I really can't agree that a story is somehow required to have plausible explanations to be called Science Fiction. I also can't agree that the trend of plausible explanations being present is in any way new. Stories from the 1950's and even earlier often had very complex and imaginative technologies, complete with very plausible explanations. The only part that made it matter as far as calling it Science Fiction, was that the stories hinged around those components. If you can remove the hither-to-unknown science from a story and come out with the very same story - it was never Science Fiction.**Personal opinions, and last I checked there is no definitive answer on that.;There's a degree to which you don't have to explain the tech - who writes about someone getting in a car to go somewhere or turning up the thermostat to heat the house and goes into detail? If a world's really well imagined and concrete enough, we have to accept that some people in that world would love nothing more than to spend hours talking about how the technology works, while most would blithely use it without giving it a second thought unless/until it breaks down.I can't recall Ursula Le Guin explaining her ansibles beyond their ability to transmit communications instantaneously across space. But they worked so well as a taken for granted technology that they got lifted by Orson Scott Card and others.My tendency is to see categories as starting points; they soon become too messy and muddled to be really useful. There's more of a Venn diagram going on, or a 3D grid in which the varieties of SFF link up and merge.YMMV... :);Post-apocalyptic and dystopian sci-fi/fantasy was my childhood staple, along with every bit of mythology and fairy tales I could lay my mitts on.

And then the 80s happened: Mad Max, Threads, Terminator, Blake's 7, Z For Zacharia...  Strikes me that much of the now-popular zombie stuff was getting traction as we realised the extent of consumerism's horrifying effects on the environment (Romero kicked that one off), and leaked into the mainstream because of the factors you cite, Sean?

The  SF  makes  the audience  comprehend, and  piece together  what is being described.   Something  can  be described as ""narxical"" and ""copudrazational"" (completely made up words that might be used in fantasy), but regardless of  their accuracy, will not get the idea across. It  would make absolutely no sense to the reader.   Now describe things in  relatable terms  that the   audience could piece together,  so the audience can  envision terms/situations/characters/environment/emotions/actions.   For example:  ""a brilliant hue of blue, with a 3rd-Dimensional depth,  giving an illusion of varying shades of blue""These things we can understand.

Some pieces clearly fall in one camp or the other, but many are strongly both. I've resorted to using the term ""speculative fiction"" with writings that are neither and/or both.I'm careful with whom I use the term, since it sounds slightly snooty, but it describes the genre much better.  ;My take is that the first half is about the lack of altruism in normal social interactions. Everyone wants something tangible to exchange/sell in advance of their physical goods - business as normal. The second half is about how things change if you are marketing feelings and effort instead of things. If you have something socially powerful to 'sell' (death, grief) - in this case people will give you intangible effort (sympathy, help) because you have already given them something intangible in advance (and perhaps because they hope / expect the same - funerals are a social thing after all, whereas business is usually personal). It is still not altruism. In both cases - payment up front, physical or emotional. So why does everyone die in the second half? The second half has two sub-halves:  1. the helpers that underestimate the effort that is needed and fail 2. the big procession that is too much and overwhelms the helpers and cock. I agree with others that these are both themes of being unable to cope. This is finished off by the cock himself being unable to cope in a different way - emotionally (dying of grief). So I think the first half is about life and selfishness; and the second half is all about grief and coping - in both halves the theme leans towards striving, failing and the roles of social interactions and responsibilities. Also - it is full of themes of immortality/mortality, life & death: Pt 1 - life. Bride's 'red silk' - I think that one is obvious reproductive symbolism :) Garland - the reproductive parts of plants (flowers) Willow - clear symbol of eternal life, reproduction (willow sticks grow new whole willows) Pt 2 - death. Stone - dead matter Straw - dead grass Coal - burns brightly until it is quenched then 'dies'. Of course it doesn't actually make logical sense at all because the mice only make one wagon and that gets across with the hen on it. The rest of the procession then falls in with the wagon, even though that wagon presumably still has the hen's corpse on it - loaves and fishes anyone?? So we got an extra wagon from somewhere unless he dumped the corpse and went back - why would he do that ? Unless the social responsibilities of attending the followers became his additional burden.  Ultimately though, once the crowd had 'gone' - it was just him and his wife.. The moral might be: Everybody dies, and the journey before death is full of all kinds of interactions and responsibilities wrt other people; some will help, some will hinder, but they all die too in the end and ultimately we all die alone. Cheery - no? :) P.s. I'm also wondering/thinking  if the two brooks are the same ones and whether they represent the flow of time (life) which can sustain you or kill you.  ;Stephanie's post made me look back and wonder about a religious interpretation. I was running with the bride being a bride of Christ (nun) and the red silk being a (negative) reference to Catholicism ..as was the willow (used in place of Palms for Palm Sunday)... I was working up to the second half being about pagan symbolism: straw (corn) / fire / earth and a burial under the mound. However, I was then trying to shoe-horn in the other animals into the pagan part and did some research on the period - so I would like comments on the possibility that this story is actually historical; and specifically about the 30yrs war and the end of the Bohemian and Holy Roman Empires (everybody dies). This was a devastating religious war, started by a battle on White Mountain (!). Major involvement by the French (cock ?) where lots of countries / states joined in the procession of death (those animals - stag, bear, lion, wolf, fox, seem awfully heraldic to me). Too tenuous?? :)  I've done my essay on something else - so this is just curiosity.. ;Personally I think that a view that is NOT the same as my own often enriches my reading more than one that is; even if it only prompts me to go back, try to see it the way they did and find evidence (or just possibiliites) one way or the other - maybe it will change my mind, maybe not, but either validating, challenging or surprising is IMHO enriching... And as for different personal backgrounds - it's like in Close Encounters - not everyone sees the same thing from the same perspective, and sometimes it helps to see things from the other side :) ;I think I'm probably mainly with anonymous here. I do also agree that it could be a wish for a simpler time (before those dang steam machines came out of England and took away all our jobs).. but I suspect that references to the 'magical olden days' are usually more personal and harken back to days when individuals had less responsibility - i.e. when they were children, or before they got married, or before they had debt, or children, or disease, or disappointment.  So, this seems like a bit of contaminating adult irony to me.However, as has been suggested in SF by Niven and others since, perhaps people genuinely thought that the magic had gone away compared to earlier times. Urbanisation, deforestation and the  concomitant loss of fauna might be mentally linked to the loss of the 'dark-woods' and everything magical that lived there (wolves had already gone from the UK and Ireland by the time these tales were written down).  I also wonder about the timing - and how much effect that whole mess with Napoleon had on the stability and peace of mind of the storytellers canvassed for the 'Tales'? Perhaps there was a real perception of loss of personal control compared to earlier..;This is fun   I'm Edgar Allen Poe (from first essay).   Quite pleased with that :) ;I see what you are saying but I don't think this approach is easily separated into classic and modern.  K.J.Parker, Robert Jordan, George R Martin and Brian Aldiss (Helliconia) move their worlds quite glacially (particularly the last two ;p ) with a lot of focus on the secondaries. Whereas Wyndham, Wells and Verne shoot off at quite a pace with few characters and little effort on the side stories.  As for multiple climaxes - I heartily recommend Thomas Hardy - the original steam punk writer :/ - like Dickens he wrote episodically (for money) with a big crash at the end of every chapter. Far From The Madding Crowd is a great example... I like both.. ;I do wonder if that perception might be partially because a very large proportion of SF now seems to be Film/TV spin-offs compared to even a decade or two ago. Those mainly have a pretty strict time-frame and pace. Perhaps also as suggested above, more current SF seems to be Young Adult (judging by the shelves in bookshops - although we have always traditionally had our own ghetto by the children's books) than previously, and YA often has a faster pace and is frequently written from the perspective of a single main character that is representing the reader. ;"

I know that my 'phrase' is contentious in terms of the representation given (token vs shock vs incorporated or otherwise making a point); but for the moment I'd like to suggest that SF has often been ahead of the curve at any given time.  In the days when race, homosexuality, disability and other minority roles  were only found in the mainstream when the story was EXPLICITLY about that aspect of the character - SF (and fantasy) in contrast just included a range of characters (often as leads) without making it odd that they were there. Any examples I use will have flaws and often seem trite in retrospect,  I but I'm just asking you to compare SF to mainstream at the times they were released.  Straw entity 1: Race. Consider the first televised interracial kiss (Star Trek); consider the Enterprise crew; consider the leads in Romero's early Zombie films ('Night' and 'Dawn'); consider the cast of the Matrix series, Dr Who, Quantum Leap. Think about the genre that has made Will Smith and Wesley Snipes heroes for their characters NOT their race. I can go on but won't. Some times I suspect that SF/fantasy as a genre in the past has been one of the main areas that has kept the non-white TV actor population employed... in books it is harder to see this unless it is pointed out explicitly (e.g. if the race doesn't matter then you don't know), but again there are plenty of explicitly 'but it doesn't matter that they are' black characters in SF even going back into the bad ol' 50's :)  I could try the same for differently-abled characters, but I'm not an expert on understanding when a genuine minority actor is not playing the role (e.g. Avatar) vs when they are (e.g. Aliens4, Game of Thrones). It is much easier for me to point out examples in literature - even OLD ones: Forever War, Non-stop, Flowers for Algernon etc.. Although I am falling into the trap that in some of these the 'disability' is essential to the plot and is not just incidental. Homosexuality and transgender has a loooong history in SF/Fantasy and is still going strong (as pointed out for Dr Who and Torchwood - perhaps to the point of self pastiche!!). Perhaps it is sometimes a little heavy handed (Heinlein) or extreme (Farmer, Rice) but there are lots of more moderate examples where is is just a part of life (e.g. the Forever War again). Oops.. Sorry, getting a bit long here and reading back I can see even more flaws in the examples, but I still think that SF/Fantasy has a better than average track record. Not just as 'crumbs' to minorities - because we all know that 'flints' would be better there, but genuinely as an area of exploration or just simpy inclusion. Where we can even try 'Ok.. A and B are different people, but how will they cope with situation x where their differences are now trivial'... Or am I rambling?  One problem might be that it is hard to get away from the 'difference' between people being a plot point. If it is irrelevant that someone has two hearts - why mention it? I don't really characterise myself as my sex, gender, race or physical abilities when I read - for example, writing here, are any of these things really relevant? I've never had blue skin and I am not hermaphrodite, but it doesn't mean that I cannot empathise with someone in a story, or post about / discuss a story character that has those attributes. I know we bring a lot of baggage to our lives from our past, but as someone brought up as (and by) a feminist pagan; it doesn't stop me being an atheist or reading sexist literature and being able to analyse it without anger, unless that's what lights your candle! ;Thanks for that, we seem to be like-minded (and equally long winded :) - I've only a few mins now, but one thing you brought up is something that has bothered me for quite a while now: I don't mind what the Doctor's sexuality is (the boy/girl-flirting has been quite amusing); I'm not toooo bothered that it seemed inconsistent (he's pretty whimsical generally); It DID disappoint me that he did the grabbing thing because it didn't fit; but what has perturbed me the most (really) was that he had any sexuality AT ALL!! I guess MY Doctor is competely asexual and only play-acts human interactions. After all, he's old enough to be their great-great-great-etc. I'm guessing because I grew up with him and he's always been a kind-of teacher figure. But then his personal life started to intrude after Rose... :) I know every time there is a new Doctor the speculation is that they will be female/black (even back to Pertwee's time) but I can't see the trend of sexy young male doctors ending as long as the current writers are in charge (although I REALLY REALLY thought that River was going to turn out to be the Doctor when we first met her).

Since the Alice stories seem to mainly take place in a genteel garden party environment of a fairly posh house - I'm going with the latter. ...anyway it's what is in Alice's head that matters to me as reader, not what she looks like.... ;I agree - looking glass (LG) is much richer and much more memorable.  Wonderland (W) in places feels like a rushed stream of upper middle class academic word games, mainly puns and double-ententres with a tacked-on ending (unless I am missing something and I'm trying hard not to); whereas LG is more rounded and satisfying in my opinion, better paced and full of math/topology references, puzzles and generally somewhat wittier I think. I disagree that it is nonsense though - each set piece has a logical set of rules, but the language is deliberately designed to confound our expectations and send us off in unexpected directions. So, not nonsense but more dissonance..... ;There are some real examples of reversed causality in Alice where the pain appears before the prick, or the crime follows the punishment - and Carroll is clearly challenging our perception of time's arrow and emphasising the standard acceptance of physical laws. I suspect in your syllogisms above, the middle term is completely redundant (You'd probably have to add 'Humans are the only animals that can speak' and tweak a few more words ); but I see where you are going. Carroll seems to make the most of uni-directional logic and often tries reversing it to show how silly that is. I do have to agree that quantum theory produces all sorts of nonsense. If you don't read Alice, does the Cheshire Cat die? Oops - spilling over into quantum Peter Pan there for a moment... ;It wouldn't matter if you could leave pigs out in the middle (or have minus pigs, or fractional pigs, or even imaginary pigs :) - there is no mathematical / spatial solution because it is fixed by the 10.

Seriously, humans have a long history of 'easter eggs', hidden subversive images and intellectual games in picture form (e.g. the Mona Lisa).

In my own head I boil this down to the human need to be part of the 'in-crowd' - the cognescenti, the specially informed. This stretches from hidden symbolism in architecture all the way over to knowing the hidden moves in a video game. If you find them for yourself, you get an 'aha - I'm smart, I'm knowing, I belong'; if you are told then you are 'part of the club,  privileged, initiated'. Too cynical?;Yes I did enjoy them as a child, particularly the Walrus & the Carpenter, Lion & Unicorn and Jabberwocky (The latter being one of the few poems I memorised as a child - and yes, I still have it in there). I never saw the Disney film so my recollections are all from the book. I wasn't scared of the Q of Hearts and the beheading stuff because she was all just ineffective tantrum, but I do remember being scared of the 'things alive on the other side of the mirror' and the whole Red King thing (whose dream is it). As for Enid Blyton - quite patchy generally, but The Secret Island was one of my most influential books as a child (almost equal to The Magician's Nephew - Probably my favourite children's book ever).  It wasn't until I was much older that I really appreciated Humpty Dumpty and the White Knight (who always reminds me of Don Quixote). ;It can go either way for me. In a book you are free to imagine for yourself many of the aspects, particularly the background, but in a movie you get to see someone else's imagination - both are good. It is interesting that a movie can sometimes change your view of characters in a sequel - Harry Potter did that for me where I saw the movie characters in later books; as did the Stand, on re-reading I 'saw' (some of) the actors. Some authors fare well in screen and some don't. On occasion you get a prolific author that goes both ways. For me, King is such an example (purely IMHO - YMMV): The Shining is better in the book; Carrie is better in film; Firestarter and Christine I have problems remembering which is which in my memory.  I am very nervous of the up coming Enders Game film - a personal favourite and I hope they do it Justice. ;I very rarely get scared by films (believe me I have tried), but books can quite frequently do the job very well (and it doesn't matter if I'm on my own in the dark for either so it is not the difference in environment). So, I believe I agree with King - thank you for that tidbit. MILD SPOILER: Ironically his books have never actually scared me, but just one of his films disturbed me quite badly and it was because of something not explicitly stated. In The Mist, when the big event happens at the end; I went back over all of the decisions that they had made throughout the film. Every single branch point, I agreed with their decision and probably would have done the same - they are sensible and rational, the alternatives are clearly bad. Except that every single one is exactly wrong.... given the 'final decision' - that is scary. So I got scared, not by the actual events themselves, but by the discovery that they had serially tricked me and that I would have ended up in the same place... that's a very book-like effect and made it the only scary King for me. SPOILER END ;Guilty secret - I didn't really like Gatsby either, it's like Catcher in the Rye - I kept waiting for the big twist.... Rebecca on the other hand :) - Great book, decent films... ;For many years I have loved http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Company_of_Wolves . It is partially based on Red Riding Hood but has lots of sub-stories that are very Grimm.  Written by Angela Carter and directed by Neil Jordan it is IMHO a must see for anyone interested in Fairy Tales. BTW - Huge amounts of mature symbolic stuff in it about menarche and men as wolves etc :)  I'll duck the missiles, but I still think that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_(film) is beautiful. Directed by Ridley Scott and with a very young Tom Cruise it is solid fairy tale stuff, again, lots of symbolism. ;Obviously we have the illustration which has to be taken as gOsPeL - so we can see how long the sword is and roughly what it looks like. Through and through suggests that this action matches the length of the blade. If it has to go all the way through the Jabberwock to the back. This means that it is an awfully long blade for the wielder since it is a wide-blade not a rapier or foil. It looks like the equivalent of a two-handed broadsword. This is probably confirmed by the bit of hand guard we can see (could be hair, but I don't think so). Now the person with the sword is not very muscular and appears to be a young person, probably a girl (although the poem does say he), so this blade has to be very light. It doesn't seem to be a samurai-style blade and given the line down the middle, doesn't appear to be especially thin - so it again has to be made of a very light material. (S)he is holding it in a manner that is going to be really hard to deploy overhead unless it is incredibly light - and she won, so presumably it really is almost weightless.  The noise 'snicker-snack' sounds like scissors or possibly a very sharp blade on a crispy material, so I'm going to consider the target.. The Jabberwock does have a waistcoat on ?!? and seems to have scales under (by extension of scales elsewhere) which would inhibit the blade. It also seems reptilian or at least vertebrate, so it is probably not hollow (like an insect, spider or most other invertebrates). That said, it has teeth and wings so I'd suggest that it is possibly a pterosaur or equivalent proto-bird and may have hollow bones and reduced mass. It seems to be flying (or at last supporting itself on its tail) so that would seem to be confirmed even if the wings are not capable of full flight (doubtful) and are only used for speed (like archaeopteryx) or momentary height/rearing advantage. I am worried about six appendages (all of which seem derived from a pentadactyl limb form - 3 toes, 4 fingers, 5 wing-fingers) - but I'm going with an homeotic mutation duplication on that since we have the precedent of the dragon (I suspect this is a subspecies of dragon). Possibly it would not be too hard to do 'through and through' on a foe like this and it might be delicate/crispy enough to make a 'snicker snack' sound as the small person whacks it. On balance, I suspect that the blade may very well be magically enhanced, but failing that - it is probably not as heavy as it looks; and the foe is probably not as heavy or fearsome as you might think from first impressions.  My personal speculation is that the vorpal sword is hollow and carved from a single feather, much like a quill pen - after all (apologies Stephanie)... The pen is mightier than the sword. ;Thank you for those kind words - keep them in mind if you ever see my essays ;pJust thought I should add that in 'reality' I think that the illustration is almost certainly ironic.In my view - yes that's Alice with the b*****y great sword.She's imagining herself in the old poem which is clearly about a male juvenile hero (probably with bulging great muscles) heading off into the dark woods with his sword to fulfill his coming-of-age   (Freud anyone? Grimm anyone?).That sword is way too big for her (it's clearly a her) and it is clearly too heavy; those wings are also far too small for that thing to fly. She doesn't know how to handle the sword and is standing incredibly awkwardly (Gauche / naive).  So this is a cutesy picture of Alice imagining that she is a hero in a poem IMHO :) - who said she always had the dress on!;@Laurie - Thank you - much appreciated. Me neither actually - there's a lot of choice (although I think I'm probably going for the Red King). @Stephanie - If you like realistic fantasy - K.J.Parker - Colours in the Steel (Fencer Trilogy 1.) is pretty inte;Thank you - I think I lean that way too. I wonder if the sword would be Vorpalescent to look upon? Things that make me go hmmm...: From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal : ""Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott's Anne of Geierstein in 1829, however, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.[26] Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next twenty years or so.[28]"" ;You probably already know this, but if not - you might like to read about the M vs Q effect: http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/10/you-are-not-so-smart-why-we-cant-tell-good-wine-from-bad/247240/  It's (to my mind, but I'm not a psychologist) similar/analogous to the boubakiki link (thanks for that BTW - it made me look at Jabberwocky again which is always nice :) .  In the Pepsi taste test where cups were labelled M & Q, experimenters suggested that people chose some letters on cups over others regardless of the content. Bit sad for people called Quentin - although perhaps that is a bit of insight why more people have names beginning with M ! ;I've been puzzling about the Crow in Tweedledum/dee. Does it appear because Alice wishes it; or is it the result of narrative inevitability because it was prophesied in the poem? If this is Alice's dream, then is she in charge or is she just a pawn? The (chess) rules are obviously guiding here; but is she assumed to be free to act and influence events? Her final moves are predicted, so is she completely bound by narrative cause and effect; and is this a reference to her being a character in a book? ;..the survival of the 'narrator' is not always guaranteed either. I can think of quite a few books where the narrator is already dead, sublimed, unreal or even never born - including your 'MS found in a bottle' style suggestion of an epilogue. The problem is that naming them would be a major spoiler to most of the ones I'm thinking of - with the probable exception of Tristram Shandy which defies spoilers :) Personally I rather like successive 1st person - especially if they cover the same event from different perspectives - although I agree with most posters in not having a set preference. ;I really love the forever war by Joe Haldeman which is first person. On the other hand - one of the very very few SF books to ever gross me out so much that I couldn't actually finish was first person as well - I wonder if that is why :) - Crash by J.G.Ballard. ;Me too (three?) - I've done a word cloud of the 10 essays that I saw (including mine) and it is not as clear as I thought it would be:;Reading these comments I'm so glad I decided not to discuss childhood at all - not so say I did the right subject either in the end...  Almost all of my marking was about childhood too (I went higher this time as well - 8 - but stopped at 9 because I genuinely couldn't think how to comment on it). So I guess that's a consensus - these are books for children.... Perhaps after Grimm that was actually a relief to many people. I did see quite a bit of hostility towards the books and dismissive comments about the content in more than one of the essays that I marked; which surprised me (and squandered words). Most of this negativity was about Wonderland and I did (probably unfairly) wonder if some of the writers had got round to the second novel :) - if you didn't, then do try it because you might like it more. On balance, I thought the essays I marked were better for Grimm; and probably more interesting in the main. Personally I rather liked Looking Glass. So - next week - will it be 5 essays about dominance in sexuality? :) ;Megan - heh heh - yes I agree that's a front runner. Although my money is probably on the disconnect of the aristocracy from peasantry, changing social structures in contrasting societies, maybe even a little 'Droit du seigneur'?  I haven't read Dracula since I was 12 so I'm looking forward to starting. I have a very very long flight on Saturday so I'm saving it until then; and my essay will probably then be about constraint, discomfort, claustrophobia, and journeys between different cultures where the upper classes have advantages not available to the cattle classes. Not that context influences readings at all :) ;In Brit-speak:  Marmalade is a citrus jam with peel in it and is bitter/sweet;  Jam is almost any fruit (or occasionally some vegetables) cooked with lots of sugar (usually not citrus but can be); Curd is jam with egg in it and is usually citrus (mmmm.. Lemon curd); Jelly is quite different and is basically solidified fruit juice - not usually very sweet. I agree about lime marmalade - mmmm.. In Victorian times I understand that quince was commonly used as well for marmalade - never tried it myself. Traditionally marmalade is commonly a breakfast thing, so the only symbol I can think is that she is falling away from the beginning/dawn of her day/life because the marmalade has already come and gone...!? ;I havent read these books but... I've visited several archaeological sites in China and my impression is that Jade is most commonly associated with the aristocracy (so - no change there vampires=aristocracy); and grave goods. There were a lot of jade artefacts in the Ming tombs; and large valuable pieces of jade in the Forbidden City.  Some jade artefacts were more valuable than gold or silver and they would have been owned by the rich and powerful; my understanding is that they are commonly associated with long life (but IMHO most symbols and TCM are associated with long life in China - perfectly reasonably). As for secrecy, that's IMHO probably a hang over from the common western perception over many centuries that the East is mysterious and unknowable - pragmatically I think this is mainly a function of distance and unfamiliarity :) On the other hand, in western literature, jade is probably just a shorthand for China (somewhat unfairly to the Mayans and other Southern Americans because 'quetzal jade' was just as important down there - it was in the tombs at Palenque for example). The other shorthand for China is Dragon, but I don't believe that dragons are really blood 'suckers', they certainly aren't sneaky in Welsh/English culture - very much in-your-face predators :). In China, there seems to be much more of a fusion of ghost/vampire than in Europe which might add to the secrecy thing? Sorry to focus on Chinese culture rather than Korea, Japan etc. but I've only been to cities in those other places and I don't feel that I can comment on ancient/myth cultures there. ;That part about running water always used to amuse us as kids because Dracula would have such a hard time in any town or house with sewers or indoor plumbing.  The thing about the tides is interesting though - so moon position controls him? Or is it just that the water is still (as long as it is not too windy) and not running at high/low tide?. ;Possibly the easiest way to think about it is in a car.  You look in the rear-view mirror at the car behind. It uses its right indicators and they are on your right too. The driver is on the same side as you are. So left and right have not been reversed By using a mirror you are not reversing up and down (obviously); but you are not reversing left and right either, you are just showing a representation of what is behind you. Every point is mapped onto the image directly, the left stuff stays on the left.  But your brain says it is reversed and so you consider it as if you were looking through the mirror from the other side which is not the same at all. Try it with 'mirror writing' - it is reversed right? Written from right to left..? Yes, but to read it, you have to show it to the mirror by reversing it first and showing the written side of the paper to the mirror (the blank side faces you). If you look THROUGH the paper it is both normal to you AND normal in the mirror. The reversing was in the way you handled the paper, not the imaging. Does that help? ;"

Otherwise, won't the file just be sent in its native format?;Sean, I'm not familiar with how things work on a Kindle Paperwhite, but what I did with my Dracula notes was to mount my Kindle on my Mac's desktop, copy the ""My Clippings"" file to the Mac, and then read them there with a text editor. Much easier than scrolling through them on the Kindle.;Hi, Sean. Sorry that the computer option won't work at the moment, but I envy you getting a chance to see Oz!;If it is the median then yes it could (and would also if it were the mean) but not necessarily:  11223 is the same median (2) as 112233 or 1122233.- although 111233 would conventionally be the mean of the two middle numbers = 1.5I do wonder what the drop-out on marking is?If they have gone from 4 to 5 that would suggest to me that there might have been quite a bit of drop-out last time.In a class this size there should be a reasonable  probability  that some rare people might get quite few marks, possibly very few.I wonder if they then get topped up by staff markers?If I was running it, I might welcome extra marking to cover some of that shortfall.It wouldn't be unreasonable to imagine that people that don't submit an essay might be less likely to submit marks so I might also pre-emptively add their allocation of essays to a pool that was picked up preferentially in the 'optional evaluation' list.In the last day of marking I might add essays that had low numbers so far to that pool as well.Some people will mark same day, some will leave it to the last day - I'm betting there might be a dip in between.;Ah - OK, fair point, I hadn't noticed that arrangement, but my mealy-mouthed 'wouldn't be unreasonable..' covered that (by accident :)  Thanks.;Hannibal is very good and I'm curious to know where it is going.  I'm afraid though that my favourite serial killer is still Dexter - Hannibal has a long way to go to top him..  Hmm.. top him - that's a thought... Dexter vs Hannibal vs Dracula.. Actually... Doesn't Dexter strike you as a bit Van Helsing in some ways... ;Ducking the missiles, I actually quite like it this way round because I get to think about the book(s) - go off onto wild tangents and make my own decisions. Then I watch the videos and agree (or disagree) with them; and fairly often have an 'oh - I didn't think of that' moment that I quite enjoy.  I'm probably too easily influenced, but if I saw the videos first it might be harder for me to come to my own conclusions. If this was a science class then I agree that lectures first would be better (although - reading papers before a tutorial - hmmm...).  The bit I find hard is deciding on the theme of the essay because it seems very arbitrary - anything goes. That said, I presume that intellectual triage is one of the skills we are learning :)   I'm also taking a 'purist' approach and only using the current text and no outside sources (which would be considered wrong in all other courses I have taken) - I have no idea if that is the right thing to do but it means I get to do more thinking than researching - which feels right for me. I know how to research but I probably don't know how to think in this context and practice makes perfect  (10,000 hours apparently - mentioned in another thread and summarised here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)  ).I don't need any particular grades (although I'm competitive enough to want good ones) - so I can understand how I might be more anxious about the structure if I thought that 'giving the right answer' or 'matching the lecture' would improve my grades.That's not meant to infer that  everyone who doesn't like the structure has that reason though - it's just the way that I think that I might think about it... - I think.  ;Unfortunately it has been very common in various types of literature that the character that has impure thoughts, even if those thoughts are essentially chaste but inherently imply a consideration of consummation - has to have a comeuppance - in extreme cases (or if they act on these thoughts), that means they must die*.  So I think Lucy is not really portrayed as pure. *There are lots of examples in books and films, so many that there are several parodies of this 'rule' including Scream and Cabin in the Woods. ;The Americans in Mexico and Guatemala might disagree that displaying skulls is macabre, but I know what you mean. For that matter, relics are not unheard of in most Catholic countries - it is one of the most surprising things when you first visit a Catholic Church compared to those in Scandinava/UK. I've never been in a Catholic Church in US/Canada - are there relics / explicitly tortured statues there? ;I have to admit that some of the statues I have seen in Catholic Churches are extremely graphic and quite shockingly grotesque. I'm not a catholic, so I havent visited many, but over the last year I've seen really nasty crucifixion tableaux in Puebla, Mexico and Vienna, Austria. If I'd seen these as a child I would have had nightmares - but then I (cynically) guess this is the purpose. The relics and Mexican skulls seem gentle in comparison. ;No worries, mirrors are very very odd things that behave counter-intuitively and shows us things that we normally wouldn't see - no wonder we find them creepy as children (or is that just me :) ?).Grimm, Alice, Vampires, Frankenstein... OMG, mirrors are the continuing link for the course (or is it members of the crow family? ) - *joke*;'Police' and 'Ambulance' would be written the correct way from the viewpoint of the police-car/ambulance driver if their bonnet was transparent and they were looking from the engine block. It is 'reversed' to an observer looking at the front of their vehicle but correct to you in the mirror because it is behind you, and when you have 'turned-around' to look at it head-on, you have then yourself reversed your own left and right.The glove thing - I only have  woollen  gloves and they are interchangable between hands because they are symmetrical - in fact my hands themselves are 'mirror-images' of each other already.Say however that your hands are not  bilaterally  interchangable, like in Niven & Pournelle's The Gripping Hand. Your left glove would not then become a right glove in the mirror... or would it?  I agree with anonymous 4 - llorraC siweL would have been very pleased with this - it is fun because it is a mentally elusive and counter intuitive situation.;Umm... I'm just trying to help and explain here and the mass red-arrowing seems a tad excessive - but I will persevere.I'm not a chirality denier - some of my favourite molecules are levorotatory - but it doesn't have anything to do with mirrors, they just rotate the polarisation of light in a different direction - calling them mirror-images is just a colourful description. I wasn't trying to get out of the glove experiment, I was just trying to ease into the observation that gloves are already roughly mirror images of each other (as are shoes). This is because we are evolved from bilateral animals. If you got a starfish to look in a mirror it would have a slightly different perspective. So using part of ourselves is misleading. If I wore a sandal on one foot and a boot on the other, the sandal does not become a boot in the mirror, it just becomes a sandal that looks like it would fit the other foot. I'm not saying that it doesn't look like a right sandal, but it isn't one, - it's just a reflection of a left one and it is still on my left.The mirrors we are talking about reflect in a plane. If you think of the mirror plane as being x,y then all of the positions on our side of the mirror (+z) are imaged as on the other side of the mirror (-z). Their x and y positions are not substantially changed (with some allowance for our limited binocularity, foreshortening and distortion - no mirror or eye is perfect).Your left hand or foot does not 'become' a right hand or foot in the mirror, nothing is turned around. If it was then if we walked to our left, our reflection would walk to our right, instead - it also walks to our left. If you and I stand next to each other and look in the mirror, we are not Tweedledum and Tweedledee, we are (presumably) different. I am standing on your left, but I don't become you and you don't become me in the mirror. You and your reflection are both still on my right.  I'm not sure why you say that it is a ""faulty argument about direction indicators not being reversed when seen in a rear-view mirror"" - I may be completely missing the issue you have with my posts. What do you actually think I have said that is wrong or offensive to you? If I have offended you somehow then I am sorry (if you are anon1 then I don't think I was actually disagreeing with you).;Hello anonymous 1/7 - good to see you back :)  - exactly - I was really talking about the meaning of 'reverse' in this context (...and we are back to Humpty Dumpty and ontologies :) . Hmm I wonder if it is a coincidence that rever -se starts with a palindrome??Anonymous 6 - (who I don't think is 5) - I agree with you, you are right I was sloppy with my statement about chirality - it does have an element of mirror-symmetry in the position of at least the major components (not necessarily all the way up to DNA sequence or all the way down to subatomics - it is not mathematical chirality but a reasonable approximation); However, I was really trying to bring us back to the discussion about mirrors and their images - not physical entities - which is why I said chirality had nothing to do with mirrors (in the noun-sense not the verb- sense).To be a bit Humptyish here - The trunk of an elephant, the trunk of a human, and the trunk of a tree are not the same things, but the word has the same origin and the same meaning at some levels but not others.   Mirror-images are not always images in mirrors (!).Two ironic things about all of this are that the image that we see in a mirror (as with everything else we see) passes through the (pin-hole-like) lens of our eye and is inverted up/down and left/right; but our brain knows this and corrects it - or rather is already used to it. Also, part of the visual field from each eye (left and right) in binocular vision travels along nerves to the opposite side of the brain which physically inverts it again (left to right) but again our very early childhood visual experience sorts all that out for us.  BTW - This last paragraph has NOTHING to do with mirrors (except in the 'reversing' colloquial verb sense) but I thought it was worth saying, especially considering how the image in a concave mirror would look on our retinas :)@Claire-Louise - thank you very much :);Here is mine too, I got a 4 - I'm pretty OK with that - but want to do better of course...(!).The reviewers gave some useful comments (I tend to say less than 1 but more than the others). I was especially pleased with 'charming'.If any of them are you, then thanks :)Last time I thought I had tried to do too much, this time I suspect it is a one-trick-pony :)==============In theatre, the players may break the 'fourth wall' by addressing the audience and reminding both parties that the play is a scripted fantasy. The Alice books [1,2] promote the same effect but in a more subversive and layered manner which pulls the viewer deeper into the dream.  The narrative is a 'Russian Doll', with layers of reality and story. Carroll relates the story of Alice, telling a story to her sister [3], about telling a story to her cat [4], about going through the mirror [5]. Diving deeper, Alice then recalls the story of Tweedledum and Tweedledee [6] and gradually enters the poem; blurring the line between story and her current reality. The twins in their own turn add story layers with the Walrus & the Carpenter [7] and introduce the Red King's dreams (stories) [8]; which they insist are of Alice, and which comprise her own reality.At this point, the perception of structured layers of reality suddenly collapses or inverts; and by analogy the fourth wall, the mirror, is shattered. The reader is suddenly reminded that Alice is not in the Red King's dreams, nor is he in hers; but in 'reality' they are both figments of Carroll's imagination (who is a figment of Dodgson's).   Perhaps the Red King is Dodgson - the ultimate controller (dreamer) of the story?Or perhaps we can elevate that thought yet another level and leave the social mirror of the written page to become 'transcribed' into the mind (dream) of the reader. By extension they (or more accurately - I) have now 'become' the 'Red King' since I am now 'dreaming' Alice et al, constructing their immediate reality this very moment as I read and actively re-write their story in this essay.Although... now you have read this analysis; it has entered your own mind; you are considering the story.. Surely.. Now you are the Red King?===Bibliography.[1] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll.  [2] Through the Looking Glass - Lewis Carroll.Citations: Alice - Through the Looking Glass:[3] 'When she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister' - Chapter 12.[4] 'How would you like to live in Looking-Glass House kitty?' - Chapter 1.[5] 'In another moment Alice was through the glass' - Chapter 1.[6] 'The words of the old song kept ringing through her head' - Chapter 4.[7] 'They were both very unpleasant characters' - Chapter 4.[8] 'If he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?' - Chapter 4.===FORM=== (2)peer 1      A test grammatical level seems spelled correctly. When you refer to the ""fourth wall"" denotes knowledge of theatrical staging. Referring to the ""'Russian Doll'"" makes a perfect mental image on reading levels have the Alice books, as if it were a spiral that leads to a deeper point and central to the story. Both the fourth wall concept as the roller coaster are safe to amalgamate the main argument of this essay, which is to contain stories that another story and it just breaks the cycle when the work Alicia wakes his reality.peer 2      This is nicely written. I think it would have been easier to understand if you had taken a little more time to paraphrase the sections you were talking about rather than footnoting direct quotes -- but that may have been very difficult within the word limitations.peer 3      The form you used in the essay looks good. You summed up used words and statements in the essay according to your approach. In the end, I liked your essay in the form light.peer 4      The essay had a good form. No complaints.===CONTENT=== (2)peer 1      I think the argument is very clear. The allusion to the structure where each character gives rise to a new story without departing from the main, while creating a kind of spider web in which one falls reader feeling like part of the story. The question whether we are the ""Red King"" that still dreaming and creating more characters that nurture story reveals the character reader feeling Carroll manages to convey. The word count limit imposed trials an extra challenge to condense into 320 words maximum is two-edged weapon, can be confusing concepts when writing or not allow deep approach of the work. Despite this I consider it a very good essay.peer 2      Very nice idea, well-argued. You get a little convoluted yourself as you turn everyone into the Red King, but that may be entirely warranted in context.peer 3      Your essay   s content brings shades different light to topic. When we re-read with your essay in mind we may see the story somewhat different. In the end, I think you did a good job. Thanks.peer 4      The topic of the essay was amazing and very creative. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.===EXTRAS===peer 1      I like the way it describes the history levels Alicia. I hope my comments serve to keep learning in this wonderful course.peer 2      This is a charming essay. I love the idea of the fourth wall and its convolution! I've read Alice a hundred times, and I am always glad to see a new thing in it.;I'm not sure these would make me reach for the 1 (I am probably under % for that) but these damage the essay IMHO:It's not all about youI want to know your opinion of course; and your special insights.But it's not all that useful to spend a paragraph on how much you dislike this novel - because I just can't mark that. It is even harder if you write about how this interacts with something personal in your life. I'm marking the essay not you.The logic difficult and sentences to follow it isI will try very hard to understand what you are saying but if I cannot work out what the point is; or if it is so convoluted that I get lost in the meaning then I have to assume that it is not a finished essay.Saying the same thing saying the same thing saying the same thing many times.I want to know why you think that and what evidence or other examples you have. It is only a short essay and I do read every word so I will notice if you say the same thing with the words in a slightly different order or using synonyms.;I think there is a lot of personal religion, but little church (organised religion) except in some of its secondary symbols. The effectiveness of belief and 'personal ministry' is emphasised much more than the clergy - they actually explicitly promote themselves as gung-ho crusader knights.  ;A you might be interested in an old film comedy - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061655/ The Fearless vampire Killers - by Roman Polanski that confronts the problem of a Jewish Alfie Bass becoming a vampire (the crucifix doesn't work any more).  ;Yes - on balance I prefer the original to the remake but the remake is growing on me.IMHO the biggest difference in in 'Spirit of Man' where I really like the original voices more.I haven't seen the stage show but i have heard very good reports.  ;Yes that irritated me too.. Unless that whole rigmarole of getting to the castle the first time means that it cannot be approached directly without Dracula's direct intervention (or death)?   Perhaps it is like Brigadoon and the castle only appeared / could be entered on select occasions... Otherwise why the round and round with the flames (the explanation given was highly suspect). ;Ahh.. Well, history is written by the winners. Dracula was just a misunderstood foreigner run out of town based on a lot of supposition and prejudice. He just happened to be in the wrong places at the wrong times and was haunted/pestered by those awful vampire women that did all the actual damage. Just because no one saw them in the UK..... A tragedy of stereotyping based on physiognomy and assumption. ;I don't think anyone has mentioned it (BTW is there a way to subscribe to all threads and their subthreads at once?) but I laughed out loud at the weird out of place Shakespearian-like comedy interlude in Chapter 24. Mina is reporting Van Helsing's misunderstanding of the Clerk's report of the Czarina Catherine's Captain's robust conversation with Dracula about his getting passage to run away. So far so confusing.. ... but it is the misquotes that made me laugh. Especially as Mina was reporting it so po-faced and Van Helsing is clearly not getting it, and it is so well themed for the book but so strangely PG13: ""Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood'  'He doesn't want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship with blood on her also' These two I translate as: 'You'd better be bloody quick, my ship leaves this bloody place before the turn of the bloody tide'  and  'I don't want no blooming bloody Frenchmen in my bloody ship' ....and it goes on for a page or so... I'm at a bit of a loss however, to account for 'polyglot', especially within the sentence: ""The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood""  I can guess, but I can't substantiate it....  ;Still racking my brains - at the moment I favour:  ---bzzzztt - untranslatable-- I've found settling on the topic harder each week - this week ended up as a toss between 'moon vs sun' imagery (weight of notes) or 'blame it all on Lucy' (moment of inspiration). I've run out of personal time so Lucy got it in the neck. Good luck with the 'rude mechanicals' :) ;@Megan I'm intrigued - please do post when the hurly-burly's done.. I'm speculating about myths of riding horses and pulleys because I can't see anything else there.. :) . ;My favourite Bradbury is not being covered - 'The fruit at the bottom of the bowl' - curiously though it is awfully Poe like :) ;There are a lot of references to other literature in Dracula. Several to Shakespeare: Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello. Poems: 'Painted ship upon a painted ocean' - loc 1199, ancient mariner. 'Casabianca' - loc 1261, the boy stood on the burning deck. ...even references to current events like the 'famous burglar' reference. So - why? Familiarity? Credentials? Association? It happens in 'modern lit' and I just don't get it - because it breaks you out of the story it seems disruptive and unnecessary. I know it implies a lot of prepackaged symbolic baggage and shorthand referential stuff from other books (building on the shoulders of giants), but it can date a book quite badly. ;Pantomime writing :)  although I've enjoyed the odd Panto in my time!  I did wonder if it had anything to do with his job and if I was missing a load more theatrical references - quite a bit did feel written for the stage (especially the humourous Captain interlude with blood ;p ) - but I might have been imagining that. ...exit followed by vampire bear. ;Sorry, I really couldn't see any male homosexuality although there were plenty of situations where I was expecting it (especially in the castle). Not much in the way of female homosexuality either really - unless you read an awful lot into the early letters between Mina and Lucy. All the vamp on human stuff was hetero (even the kids - apart from one called an it throughout, the rest were boys).  Not even any innuendo with the various sailors and yokels... I was actively looking (after seeing the earlier post about it) and I was rooting for Van Helsing to come out, but this novel seems very sexual and entirely straight to me. Happy to be proven wrong though. ;I agree with Kristine, I didn't see any evidence of penetration of men by Dracula or even hints.  Neither Renfield or Harker were bitten AFAIK - I still can't see any reason to differentiate between simple personal dominance or possibly hypnotism (same ballpark concept) vs homosexuality in this novel for those guys. I will follow up on those refs though. ;I saw Renfield as obsessive compulsive with an case of extreme hero worship or cult worship. I really didn't get the impression that he had been bitten. He had already moved from fly to spider to bird by July and was moving on to want a cat before Dracula even came to shore in earlyAugust.  BTW - anyone noticed this? Fancy that - he wanted a cat, he wanted the cat to follow the bird [how absurd]; he wanted the bird to follow the spider; he wanted the spider to follow the fly - I don't know why he wanted the flies - they foreshadowed his death :) - Good job there were no dogs, cows or horses available to him!! Back to Renfield - he seemed to detect Dracula around 19th August and went calm with a 'religious mania'. Even when he escaped I don't see any suggestion of biting, just worship of D because he was already primed to be that way. I think this was a charisma cult or personality thing not necessarily psychic - more Crowley or Manson-family-like than magical. I did think that the sniffing was interesting - suggesting 'mad-wolf' pheromones (?!? ) to me. Or something similar that made a lunar-tic obey a dominant wolf. I don't think Renfield needed to be bitten, just dominated. ;My knee-jerk reaction was that the deaths of the sailors would not be evidence of homosexuality because we have to wait until the Hollywood of the 80s and 90s for homosexual to become synonymous with homicidal. However, Dracula clearly had a period of blood lust resulting in an orgy of death on that ship, and we all know that the book makes close links between carnal and carnivore so I'm not dismissing it.  In my head the logic goes a bit like this: Penetrating the skin non-lethally (PSN) is a symbol for subversive sex. Dracula's PSN on Lucy and Mina gives them vampiric STDs (which is itself eventually lethal) therefore this is doubly sexual. The weird sisters wish to PSN Harker therefore this is a sexual interaction also. However, Renfield kills spiders. Van Helsing et al kill Lucy. Dracula kills the sailors. - killing per se is not sexual. Even if Dracula is prone to PSN, it doesn't mean that killing is synonymous with PSN activity. I know it is obvious, but not everything a homosexual person or character does is necessarily a homosexual act; sometimes a homosexual person can make a cup of tea in a non-sexual way. I'm still not convinced that Stoker's Drac is a gay icon; but even if he were, I'm not persuaded by these killings (even if they are sailors and Stoker is aiming for a 'stranger things happen at sea' theatre innuendo). The shaving blood is a bit harder - I have to read it again but I do remember it as showing desire for blood which was resisted by Dracula. So, is this a food thing or a sex thing? It's not sexual for Harker, he is not tempted but is simply under threat of becoming prey. Dracula is more ambiguous and if I was being devil's advocate and accepting the vamps as always homosexual icons, I could equally put forward a homophobia model. Consider the suggestion that Dracula is tempted by the blood but repelled by the fact that it is on a male. Dracula would seem to be happy to penetrate women (weird sisters) - although we don't actually formally know that they didn't turn Dracula (or were possibly all infected by a third party). But he doesn't penetrate Harker - why not? He abandons him, so he is clearly not needed for business reasons. He just doesn't find him attractive..... In this homophobia model, the book is about homosexual vampires, but to be honest I'm still not persuaded. ;..and if you want to try something even more extreme then take a look at Philip Jose Farmer's Image of the Beast and its sequel Blown Good luck in finishing them - you'll need a strong constitution. ;I don't think we have to agree with the premise of the essay (or at least that's how I've been marking). After all, I don't have to agree with the premise of the novel, or even like it (I'm thinking of a later book, not Dracula); and if the essay points out a topic that I don't favour, it may be accurate or insightful so that wouldn't detract from the mark either. Any essay that makes me go back and look (or even think back) has enriched my reading. This thread for example has made me consider the possible homosexual content of Dracula and has enriched my reading. I still don't see evidence for it but it made me think. If someone wrote an essay on anti-Semitism in the novel I think there may be stronger evidence but I don't think it is an anti-Semitic novel. Writing about the search for homosexuality or homophobia in Dracula seem equally valid as each other to me because of the Stoker/Wilde thing but I still don't think it is a homoerotic novel (unlike most vampire books as was pointed out). If someone wrote an essay about Dracula as a god, alien, or time travelling lord of darkness and it was written persuasively or internally consistent then I can conceive that it would be a good essay.  On the other hand, I do wonder if markers will align scores with personal beliefs. what if an essay was blasphemous, or misogynist - or pointed out that Grimm was a white supremacist manual - if your beliefs misaligned, would you give a good mark ? ;p ;It is the same here - looks like Bram Stoker by Terry Gilliam. BTW - I am completely unconvinced by that article, it uses a lot of trigger words at the beginning and reads like wish-fulfilment of supposition based on supposition. While I would be fascinated if Stoker was gay, this is not even rumor-level evidence. I'll try to find the original but if those are the most persuasive passages then that sounds like more of the same. You could use the same evidence to suggest that Stoker was a secret satanist - thanks for the link though. ;"
FALSE,St203,Coh1,5,1,0,1,0.0381512,0.993278947,0.8,0.333333333,0.65,0.8317025,1,"Sorry to come back to an old thread, but I came across a classic old poem that we learned at school (teenage) and had to analyse. It was written in 1858 around 40 years after the first Grimm edition: The Haystack in the Floods by William Morris. I remembered the violence in it but forgot just how modern it feels.  I thought it added to my Grimm thoughts, and the violence in art and Alice thread - so I have linked it: http://www.netpoets.com/classic/poems/046003.htm ;I would rather say that gender and age do not necessarily determine writing prowess (statistically yes but there are always outliers - e.g. Matthew Lewis - the Monk, Jane Austin). However, popular as travelogues and character biographies were at that time, I did find all the purple sightseeing stuff was making me doze off. It's a fusion novel not pure horror/fantasy so the flowery bits may seem overlong to some sensibilities (like mine). Without being patronising, I think she did a great job (with blood) to write something that we still hold up as a classic today - how many of her older peers did the same ?! ;...did you see 'confinement' as well as 'labour'? :) ;Yes!!! Exactly... After all that build-up, long term plans, frenetic researching, eureka moment, delving in flesh sources.. He takes one look at the end result and goes. Didn't occur to him along the way, didn't think about the consequences, didn't happen 5 mins earlier... I initially thought it just showed how bad Shelley was at understanding and presenting realistic motivations; then I considered it to be a lack of understanding about science and scientists (they do things on a whim don't they ? - because they are essentially flighty and whimsical to their very core - Bwahahahahahahaaaaa I have created life, now I will develop fusion power...).  Lastly I have come to the conclusion that this simply cannot be expected to be taken as realistic and just has to be symbolic and/or an analogy - Ta Dah! - essay fodder...! I've had all 4s so far, so I'm rolling the dice on this one. ;Yes, that (and your other two posts today) coincide quite significantly with the basis for my essay that I wrote yesterday . Oh well, I'm not working it up again - so it has to stand as deployed :) I was perhaps also thinking a touch more literally about the power placed in a teenagers hand... ;I like the ""distinction between unimportant swearing and important references to blood"" - clever! - I enjoyed this, hope it was well marked. If I was marking it I might be puzzled about the last sentence and the appearance of the 'soul of the ship' and wonder if I was missing a pun... Something about being turned with the tide Perhaps :) ... I do believe I get it though. ;When they discussed William having 'one or two little WIVES' with his favourite Louisa Biron (Hmmm... B(y/i)ron - coincidence - I think not!!) being 'five years of age' [p31] - I assumed he must be a similar age, probably not more than one year either way and I would guess he was 6. ;It is a very interesting topic. Of course both the essays and reviews are anonymous (as are some of these posts), so that actually increases the chances of people expressing prejudice. On the other hand, traditionally this kind of academic exercise is pursued by a predominance of individuals who would normally be considered 'left-wing'. So I would expect that e.g. homosexuality would not be high on a list of taboo subjects for most people here. On another hand (I'm becoming Ganesh here) religion might possibly be a little more sensitive, or paedophilia, or coprophilia, or torture, or misogyny, or colonialism, or racism. Especially if condoned or presented sympathetically in an essay... Personally I intend to mark everything objectively according to their form and content even if I thoroughly disagree with the premise, otherwise I would lose my personal integrity. One cautionary thought that I do have is that a few times I have seen essays that leave the text entirely and become largely about personal belief - I would never give a 3 to an essay like that. Everyone has taboos - some of us actively push ourselves to find out what they are, others (equally validly) keep to what we were brought up with. F/SF is a great area for exploring this limit. Here are some SF books by well-known authors that challenged my limits (I'm going out on a limb a bit here), I would be interested in other people's equivalents: Crash - J. G. Ballard  Beauty's Punishment - Ann Rice (under pseudonym - Roquelaire)  Blown - Phillip Jose Farmer ;Which Heinlein? I've only read about 60% of his novels. Found him arguably a bit sexist (I will fear no evil); culturalist (day after tomorrow); racist (Farnham's Freehold) - but none to an unbearable level (yes I will say - considering when they were written). Not particularly subversive... So I'm curious. Thanks for the others, I will look them up (always like to test my boundaries)! ;The doctor refers to 'him' a few seconds before Van Helsing uses 'it' and it is consistent so it does seem to be accent-based - he does some weird things with language. Perhaps also, Van Helsing is not the paternal type? ;The wolf was called Bersicker - he was in a cutting from the PALL MALL GAZETTE. ;I actually just assumed that they were smaller because women's jaws and teeth tend to be smaller than men's. Also, jaw shape/size and tooth size changes on average across Europe (I am led to believe that some Polish people have a traditional nickname of 'horse-faces' for the North-Western Europeans). Drac's 'chin was broad and strong' - p21, and I am willing to bet that Lucy's was petite... ..and yes, this assumes the kids were bitten by beautiful (bloofer) Lucy, which I agree is strongly indicated (and doesn't bloo-fer look awfully like blood-fear or am I reaching here :) ;I knew an upper middle-class English Mina very well some years ago (we shared a car crash); so I can authoritatively confirm that the culturally correct pronunciation is mean-uh - the same way as pronounced for the ending of Wilhelmina. The prof uses Mina as in minor or Mynah bird which Is a US form (and coincidentally fits better with the concept of small). I guess it might be possible that the Texan called her Mynah but he would have been corrected I suspect. ;You are right I was wrong, he says it like in minnow - I coulda swore.... :) I checked out a clip on YouTube and the Winona Rider Mina is pronounced like my friend - mean-uh. http://youtu.be/_OFfuZY_Pvk ;I too think that peer 1 was overly harsh and may have settled on a mindset that leaked unreasonably into content. The grammar IS imperfect and there are several points that could easily be typos (immerse[d], close[d], journ[ey]al, normally [not] be omitted, [it] makes, etc) but I might have pointed these out as proof reading issues instead. ;I agree with Florencia in general and peer 5 to a certain extent although they (5) were a little picky.  To be even pickier:  Humans and modern apes are both phylogenetically apes and both evolved from earlier common ancestor apes.  Evolution is indeed very often about predator/prey co-selection (topically: The red Queen effect where each is running as fast as they can to stay in the same place wrt catching vs escaping).  Being the 'fittest' sometimes, for some species, means doing things that appear evolutionarily 'retro': Land mammals -> Whales; Winged birds -> Flightless birds; Toes -> Hooves; Sexual reproduction -> asexual. A beast-man might indeed be fitter in some environments.  Most transformations (mutations) are less fit, many are neutral and can stick around, a few are advantageous (now, or later) - some changes are selected for and then selected against in subsequent generations. I could go on with counter examples, but the point I am trying to make is that you don't actually need to be familiar with neutral mutation theory to simply suggest evolutionary pressures in an essay of this type. I think the original essay had adequate shorthand phrases about evolution for the purposes here.  ;Here's mine, please don't be gentle with me :) I tried something quite different (for me) this time, provocative and doing a character rather than a theme/structure. I was slightly weirded out by 1,2,3 commenting on form/content and not 'other'; but 4 only commenting on other (and a bit crossly I believe - 2x1's perhaps ;p ). My direct response to 4 might be yes and yes but the point was not what 'we' think but what was acceptable behaviour in a Victorian novel; Specific thanks to 1 - I should have been tighter about Othello but again, being sexual/killed/dominated was a more vital comparison in my head because again it was about echos into the Victorian sensibility that I was aiming for. I need to pay more attention to the setup of argument I think. === Grade:4  Lucy Westenra - did she fall, or was she pushed? When we first meet Lucy she is writing a sexually charged letter about her new beau. She mentions undressing (albeit in a chaste context), blushing, and practicing poses. By her second letter she is upping the ante, bragging about her attractiveness to three men, and referencing Othello [1]. This literary allusion foreshadows her own sexualised death and prompts us to question her complicity in the coming degradation. She is subsequently penetrated by one man (Dracula); and invaded (symbolically raped non-consensually with needle and blood) by three more. Stoker even permits Van Helsing to joke to John, that Lucy the polyandrist (twice now: once in thought and once in deed) serially cuckolded Arthur [2]. Her reputation is systematically shredded by both major and minor characters - amongst them a symbolic sexualisation by (dead) suicide Geordie [3]. So it is not surprising that she has to die - narrative Victorian determinacy dictates that she has 'fallen'. Mina compares Lucy to Ophelia [4]; another Shakespearean double-ententre indicating that Lucy deserves to be pillioried, but instead receives flowers [5]; and later relates the moment of Lucy's 'fall' to Van Helsing. Her linked diary entry alludes to the 'original apple' [6]; albeit formally directed at herself but condemning Lucy by association. However, Lucy's 'fall' is contrived. Her sex-talk at the beginning seems naive and somewhat gauche; Dracula attacks her whilst asleep; and she is unknowingly impregnated (transfused) with blood. Even when molesting the (male) children and displaying her wantonness [7], Stoker partially redeems her behaviour by reference to the unconscious nature of her activities [8]. Lucy sleepwalks throughout her 'fall' with as little attention or caution as she originally gave to the potentially disastrous (in fictional terms) emotional connection with three men. Stoker manipulates these cryptic flaws beneath her superficially virtuous demeanour; and relentlessly pushes her character until it tumbles over the edge.

FORM  peer 1     Your writing is strong and you make some very good points. I like the way you note them and you say a lot in such a short essay, but I'm not clear on your conclusion. It doesn't seem to make a clear point.  peer 2     This essay excels in terms of form, for, besides using words properly and respecting grammar rules, it also presents the thesis in a clear way. Comparing to other essays, a benchmark would be the terseness achieved by the use of chosen words which express exactly the meaning of the author's idea.  peer 3     Yes the words are used correctly and the essay is grammatically correct. The argument of Lucy being a symbolic sexual object is also well laid out with passages from the story to support this thesis. Very informative. CONTENT peer 1     You make many interesting points, although some I disagree with. Desdemona, for instance, represents an innocent being killed over sexual jealousy not merely a ""sexualised"" death. By ignoring the element of innocence, which would counter the point you were making, it weakens the argument, More importantly, it is difficult to present a dual argument and not just leave the reader with just as many questions as before. You need to wrap up your thoughts into a clear point to strengthen your writing.  peer 2     This essay shows an in-depth analysis of Lucy's character, noting not only her ostensive sexuality, but also her naivet   in displaying it.  peer 3     Yes, the sexualization of Lucy throughout the story is definitely very clear. OTHER peer 4     Some points for your consideration:- Paragraph 1 - When a woman talks about her love, it is not unnatural for her to blush. When she receives not one but multiple love proposals in a day, it is also not unreasonable for her to feel overwhelmed. What is it about Lucy's blushing and reaction towards the proposals of the three men that make her so different from a reasonable woman of a similar stature? Paragraph 2 - Rape has a negative overtone in its original meaning - being violated and assaulted by rapist who desires to dominate, control and destroy against the woman's will for his personal gratification. In the case of Lucy's blood transfusion, there is no such intent. The transfusion was motivated by a desire to save Lucy's life. It was a noble act, albeit performed against her knowledge. We cannot prove that it is against her will because had she been conscious she might have agreed to undergo the transfusion. ;Thank you both for excellent comments, all comments and nitpicking welcomed :) @Mary - yes - the desecration that made her less bloofer (I'm reading kids dialect: beautiful); and the sleepwalking father smacks head :) . You've encouraged me to be even more provocative for Frankenstein (so it's your fault if I shock anyone :) @Jeremy - very helpful. I did see Ra too, I like the Lucifer connection though. Entendre was a typo (smacks wrist) - I know better. I agonised over the order of Victorian N determinacy and went with the one that weighted best in my head (I'm probably wrong). With the 3 donors I was trying to echo the 3 suitors so it was a 3+1 ( van Helsing was also somehow different ) but I take the point and should have noted this. The penultimate paragraph grammar thing is indeed awkward and easy to fix - good point! Thank you both for your time, much appreciated. Sean ;I agree with a proviso - on an iPad this is a bit dangerous. On the iPad, line breaks are often lost when you Add Comment or Submit; and you frequently get one paragraph (on the forum too). All the formatting things are greyed out on MD, but if you choose the Rich format option then sometimes the editing freezes and you lose everything. I've also had the page crash completely on changing between MD and Rich.  I can write HTML but it is a lot more work... The easiest solution I have found is using  a double return to make paragraphs - on top of the normal return. Then when one goes AWOL, the others remain. ;Yes, Young Frankenstein - one if the most quotable films ever, now put.. the candle.. BACK! ;I'll prepare to be blown out of the water but.... I think there are a lot of Frankenstein themes carried across to 'Of Mice and Men'. Obviously there are limits - the 'monster' isn't created and he is not smart, but the same stories of prejudice and misunderstanding based on physical issues; and the 'proof' that they were actually not un-reasonable after all. It seems a little like the result you might get from someone being told the story of Frankenstein without reading it :) ;If I remember correctly it was someone asking if anyone else was younger than they were. I believe they were 14.  It stuck in my mind because it made me wonder if I should moderate my book recommendations - then I remembered that I read some of them when I was that age :) - Books don't have any age restrictions where I lived and I remember reading lots of stuff that I would never have been allowed to watch on TV or film. I wish there was an option to be auto subscribed to everything and opt OUT rather than in - because I miss stuff when I am restricted to checking in by email (to do forum reading triage when I'm on a break :)  ;I think I see what you mean, if you read midsummer nights dream as a teen (as we did at 13) and then read it again a few years later - it becomes quite a different play. Although even at 13 we knew it was not just about fairies, we definitely knew that the mechanicals were extremely rude. It is also worth noting that with time comes experience; even if that is only in the trivial sense - I certainly understood more about books based in a place when I had actually visited that place (however, Piccadilly Circus now is quite different to the Piccadilly Circus of the Triffids;  Steinbeck's Cannery Row has changed a bit too; as has Ballard's Singapore).  Although saying that - I'm not 8ft tall but I can still appreciate the monsters viewpoints so direct experience is not always essential. I'm always going back to stuff and realising how superficial I was 'last time' (especially these essays :) - I'm not sure that it is just age, probably the difference between fast reading and slow reading makes a difference more than anything (which is pretty new to me too). ;Not all Percy Shelley is hard..  This is the last part of his poem 'the cloud' - I've loved this since school and it is very readable by a modern audience I believe. It also deals with birth/death/birth and eternal life through 'spirit': I am the daughter of Earth and Water, And the nursling of the Sky; I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores; I change, but I cannot die. For after the rain when with never a stain The pavilion of Heaven is bare, And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams Build up the blue dome of air, I silently laugh at my own cenotaph, And out of the caverns of rain, Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb, I arise and unbuild it again. ;Well, I think Hollywood has been nurturing the concept for some years now that grotesque/ugly/monstrous will always turn out to be good; whereas beautiful/immaculate will inevitably turn out to be evil. See Heathers, Princess Bride, Edward Scissorhands, Young Frankenstein, Dallas/Dynasty ;p yadda yadda.. Anyway, what is so horrific about the nature of the beast?  - the creature had thin yellow skin, watery eyes, a shrivelled complexion and black lips. ummm... had Shelly never seen a really old person?  Is the horror merely that someone looking so (horror of horrors) old (!?!) could be so tall, strong and vital? Is this book merely about Shelley's fear of getting old, losing beauty (clear skin, clear eyes, plump complexion and full lips); or a fear of the old being dominant over a young bohemian free-love group of ex-pat hippies? Perhaps it is about the combination of old nature and young nurture which seems anathema to one with young nature and well worn nurture...? ;I just read and read and read until inspiration strikes me and I think ""I'd like to write on that"".  I did one theme, one structure, one character, and this time I've attempted an interpretation of the author's prejudice. So I am experimenting too. I'm also trying to see what appeals to markers - I've tried smartarse, humour, shock and this time attempted empathy with a subset of markers. I don't think the number of markers really makes this viable but I'm having fun although every time is a solid 4 so I'm definitely feeling that I'm being too conservative. I've had no creative writing training since school (very little then) and I'm not a fiction author so most of this is new to me. I did one arts module at University (on the psychology of horror) but my writing is all very technical these days so yes this is going crazy. The forums and feedback are great fun and I love the pickiness of the freewheeling to-and-fro argument in them - it is quite different to the pedantry I normally experience professionally. I'm learning more on honing writing from the forum than the essays (I think). How do I do the essays?  I have my subject and I write (including rough quotes) until I have written 320+ words which gives me a frame. Then I go back and tighten up the language and exchange for synonyms where I think they are better. At that point I submit (just in case) and leave it for a while (a day) to marinade. Then I go back in and sort out the references and remove awkward structures and typos (easier to see after a break) and I read back around the area of the references and put more in, always keeping under 320. Then I leave it for a day and go back for tweaking and primping.  I always do 320 words and it is all done in the online box on my iPad with saves/submissions after every few changes (bad experiences with lost text). I have a very choppy workday so this fits in well. - this last one (Frank) I showed to a Mexican colleague because we are travelling together (raised eyebrows only and he is not a proficient native English writer so he couldn't really critique the grammar) but usually I don't get anyone to look. Lastly, my professional expertise is mainly verbal plus long emails so it doesn't really help here, Probably more likely hinders. I am really loving revisiting the essay several times as I don't usually get to hone a piece because of time constraints / immediacy and throughput of my job and I really really like going back in and changing words to fit a tone (e.g. labour instead of work for Frankenstein). Also trying to use evocative words to manipulate opinions instead of just being purely factual. :) Sorry for going on... ;So... Big long buildup, sudden climax, loss of interest.. Over and over again...  Shelley keeps repeating the same pattern of build-up followed by disappointment eh?? ;Intellectually speaking, 18 would have been a pretty peak time for most of the life of our species - after that age people are mainly gathering experience, not getting smarter (ask a mathematician).  While this text may be mature for an average 18 year old today, she wasn't average and neither are lots of modern people - statistically our population has a very long tail on individual achievement. I do agree though that our current western society tends to infantilise its population and doesn't really expect young adults to be as self-sufficient now as they were only a century or two ago. ;Yes, even the child who is supposed to be 'unprejudiced' and too young to have 'horror of deformity' sees him as an ogre. It is interesting that as readers we are guided towards judging the monster largely in a sympathetic way. We cannot actually see him, so we have no reflex animal response - perhaps we are a little like the blind man (although we have more knowledge). If we had been given a grotesque description of the monster looming over us as our first introduction to it, would we have been able to judge it quite so positively?  In some ways, it is understandable that we are reflexively concerned by the large. The potential for injury is greater. Even without training, a tiger is more scary than a cat; an Alsatian is more frightening than a Chihuahua. If you met a Neanderthal (or just a large man) in a lonely spot, you might well be more concerned than meeting a hobbit (Floresiensis), or a small woman, or a child (unless you have seen 'don't look now' :).  We are also natively programmed by our human nature to be scared of the 'other' - mainly because deformity in nature is frequently associated with contagious disease. It is only by nurture (society or experience) that we learn to overcome our nature. Perhaps Shelley wants us to realise that WE are the real monsters that have these natural prejudices and that they can only be overcome by nurture? That said, he sees the sleeping woman and just assumes that she will reject him - so he launches a preemptive strike and kills her.... ;Oh I don't know.. If I was going to learn dissection, I'd rather start on a dogfish than a minnow;  a locust rather than a fruitfly; a cow heart rather than a shrew's..  It's not uncommon to start with a model that is easy, then move to the real thing... Sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller (dissection of a whale might be problematic). If he had started by making intelligent animals into humans then perhaps everything would have turned out OK... Hmmm... Maybe that thought should be held a couple of weeks :) ;I think that probably needs to be split further into non-human vs artificial. Non human: We probably wiped out the Neanderthals and other hominids (and absorbed them by cross-mating to a small extent); and as a species we are no strangers to attempted genocide - but - non-human doesn't necessarily mean that we will attack. On the contrary, we have absorbed cats and dogs into our homes and societies - they are not human and (mostly) are not slaves or tools. You can make a moderate argument for cats killing vermin and dogs guarding - but that's not a good enough argument for the degree that they are integrated into our lives and the costs of keeping them. They are not monsters but are very 'other'. Something that looks human but is not, is often considered creepier (Robots that are too human often evoke negative impressions). As for human but artificial ... Well... Glasses, prosthetic teeth, pacemakers, artificial limbs, hearing aids, braces, piercings (ear or other).. All visible and artificial but not monstrous... IVF, inoculations, caesarian section, blood transfusions - invisibly artificial but do they make us into monsters.. ? Some religions would have us believe so. A cloned/designed human - monstrous? Soulless? I would argue no more so than someone conceived through IVF (or any other way). The monster was constructed from human and animal parts (reference to abattoirs) - so he is not fully human - but then surely if someone nowadays has a dental implant with bovine collagen then neither are they fully human ? :) On the other hand, if you met someone who was 8ft tall...... and fully human...... ;It's a little further down the syllabus page: In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee.""  ;Slightly irreverent here - but I was watching the post submission videos on the course again in anticipation of the next one and I got a really strong mental image of a Seldon vault - pre-recorded Seldon crisis :) Anyone else had this link to Asimov's Foundation ? - Please put your hand up if you are a mule or a second foundationer..... ;A couple of times now I have thought.. DID we discuss that on the forums?? Oh no the Seldon plan has gone awry.. Call in the psychohistorians... ;That's a really interesting area to consider (with a whole pillar of salt). Scientifically speaking, no, he didn't have the right. His behaviour was immoral and if the monster had a functioning human brain then it would have been illegal in most countries without due process. He would not have been allowed to make that decision on his own. Even if you consider the monster to be artificially reanimated without consciousness (plainly not true) disposal of human remains without informed consent is also a very tricky area. If he was mainly animal (abattoir parts were used) then as a vertebrate there are very specific procedures that are required in most countries, especially most of the ones in which this book is set. From a purely religious point of view e.g. Christian and I would suspect all of the other related monotheistic religions, the monster can't have a soul, is almost certainly blasphemous and I would suspect it might get shorter shrift than it would from science. :) From a Buddhist point of view - definitely immoral. Depends which century you are in for some of these answers I would think. ;Science is not silent on morality. Ethics are a very important area of science especially in the biosciences. Consider the Asilomar convention in the 70s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA Scientists have a long history of self-regulation to very stringent levels and involvement in regulation of the uses of their research (Take a look at Einstein's stance on Atomic weapons). You might even trace ethical science all the way back to Hippocrates :). The aristocrat mad scientist working alone like Victor is a useful plot device but doesn't reflect the way science actually works. Scientists completely depend on peer involvement and consensual interchange of ideas ('shoulders of giants'). I would argue far more than in the humanities where an individual can feasibly work alone and publish single author papers alone; science hasn't worked that way since the industrial revolution. The reason 'why'.. was expressed in the rest of the paragraph - ethical conduct with regard to human tissues. Maths says nothing about morality, science on the other hand is not done in a vacuum (except on Hubble). ;"

We use the median (actually 'median polish' which is a little better but would be silly here) at work and it is a very effective way of removing outliers - surprisingly so. It works well in circumstances where most contributions are accurate reports but you get occasional / rare anomalies (reviewers with a 'bad hair' day, or a slip of the brain). As for the % rules - if people felt free to give 1's and 3's more regularly, then I suspect there would be a lot more 1's and a lot more people would fail; but also improvements would be harder to see, because there would probably also be more 3's - and special should be rare - right? The marking would also generally be wilder with a lot more variance dependent on opinion more than objectivity (we have a marking model to fit) so it would have less meaning. The other book that complements this nicely is Outliers - by Malcolm Gladwell - a very good airport book :) Postscript: Your honeyed memes made me want to fly back and suggest 'The Extended Phenotype' - Richard Dawkins to you if you want to know why bees do this kind of thing more than most social animals. ;I love the connection with Rapunzel (didn't see that one at all). I also enjoyed the connection to the Grimms via the 'make a mythology for a new country' interpretation of incentive for writing. IMHO - Blooming possibly represents potential, specifically virginal (explicit comparison with D) and pre-fertilisation in actuality and in his dreams ('Fertile of mysteries'). The Vertumnus statue reminded me of Ozymandius and I linked it with the broken fountain and references to Eden implying ancient power now lost and forgotten with lurking potential ready to be awoken by incursion/invasion. Possibly given the forbidden, pernicious aroma of D's 'lady garden' this dark potential is all wrapped up in the original sin of 'secrets' becoming 'known'. Didn't catch the translation of his name either - that tickled me, especially as my own surname is a synonym for Hawthorn and young/innocent/virginal :) . ;Some of the reviewers in the Grimm unit were quite critical of number of stories used - I'm guessing that a limited focus might be received poorly. ...thoughts? ;That sounds a little like a challenge to link Grimm/Alice/Dracula/Frank and HawPoe together :) - I've never read Hawthorne before so I shall be looking..... ;Laurie, I've always assumed that because it says x of 5 left, and the submission status changes; that 5 are mandatory and the references to 4 are relics from the distant past (last run of the course).

I spent quite a bit of time rewriting it this week (stuck in an airport) and I was encouraged to be more provocative (@Mary, so I owe my breakout 5.5 to that advice :)  @Paulomi, I've been footnoting like this all along (including within the forum) and no-one has negatively commented - it is a pretty standard approach where I normally write.  @peer4 - the greatest trick the devil pulled was hiding humour as unintentional... ;p --  At the core of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein lurks a young lady's perspective of male attitudes towards pregnancy and procreation. Events shadowing the birth of the creature deliver a tongue-in-cheek criticism of male views regarding commitment, childcare and sexuality. Reproductive inequality across much of the animal kingdom often sees impregnation followed by abandonment of the female. This extends into human society which commonly permits superficial male involvement in child care (often immediately post-coitus). Young women in affairs with married men - like Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (not yet Shelley) - commonly perceive that a romantic or sexual liaison does not always result in long term commitment by the male partner once the 'goodies are delivered'. This is a significant literary theme and Mary was very aware (and probably quite concerned with regard to her own circumstances) of the sexually promiscuous and non-committal nature of men. Women give birth, men do not. In a scientifically enhanced society men may ultimately procreate without female involvement. This book is a forecast of that unnatural possibility with extrapolation to dire consequences. In Frankenstein, Victor is obsessed with the pursuit of procreation [1]. He labours [2] through confinement [3] in an isolated masturbatory frenzy of research [4,5], culminating in a single moment of triumph; the ejaculation/birth of the monster [6]. The sudden climax of his desires brings Victor back to reality [7]. His urges are gone; he is immediately overcome with guilt and regret; and runs away to evade his responsibilities [8].  Themes of obsession building to climax crowned by disappointment and irresponsible abandonment pervade the entire book. As an unmarried (during Frankenstein early-drafts) 'free-love' advocate with one tragic pregnancy, Mary might have projected her own conflicts onto Victor; or more reasonably she is suggesting that men are neither temperamentally nor naturally competent at bearing and raising children. A man, like a panda-bear, simply 'eats, shoots and leaves'.  ===CITED=== Frankenstein - Mary Shelley. [1] ""I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life"" - p23.

I really enjoyed reading it, and found you point on obsession, desire, climax, and disappointment worth thinking about.  peer 2     Your point of view sounds very interesting to me and it is persuasive too, I just think it is too restrictive to claim this as the core, I think would be better to say this is something like an important subject . But it is just my point of view  _ Thank you for enrich my reading.  peer 3     You did a wonderful job in sharing your ideas about the theme you have chosen. While I was reading your work, I really like that way you formed your fourth paragraph especially when you emphasized, ""Women give birth and men do not"". I realized that, it was Victor who created the monster without the need for a woman, but it was Mary Shelley who wrote the story proving that the book was indeed a way of Shelley to express her thoughts the role of women in society.  peer 4     I think your thesis is interesting and well supported. Two passages were, I felt, unvoluntarily funny : ""child care immediately post-co  tus"" (nursing the embryo ?) and the comparison with pandas which are known for having a low level of sexual activity. ===OTHER=== peer 1     You are a good writer.  peer 3     Your way of writing is inspiring to me. I wish I could write that way you do.  peer 4     On the whole, a well-written interesting essay. ;Onanism was actually there originally but I took it out. Interesting term - it is one if those words that is attributed a meaning inaccurately - yes the word means what you think it does, but it is derived from Onan in the bible and he didn't actually do that - he was really a case of withdrawal not solitude, so it was good that I withdrew it from the essay. I also can't see the word without my left brain cracking Robert E. Howard jokes. I'm finding Hawthorne generally a lot less inspiring than Poe (although.. Robotic butterflies, plastic surgery and transgenic vegetables... Hmmm... Starting to remind me of Jeff Noon). ;In that vein, Last Man - by Mary W. Shelley - has anyone tried it? Worth a look? ;To go back to the original sub-poster here. I have found Prof Rabkin a little variable at times and often amusing (I loved his Valdemar interpretation - it made me genuinely LOL with the sexual interpretation).

I have just finished watching: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/lecture/47 ...where he compares Portrait/Annabel and Cat/Bells ...and I was absolutely gobsmacked - the Usher/Raven was good too, but the Bells one just stunned me - I didn't see that at ALL and he presented it excellently with great timing. I need to go and get a latte, sit and re-read the Bells right now....! I feel like we are getting value for money ;p ;Those of you interested in the Faerie Queen might be interested in  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incomplete_Enchanter  by   Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. In this classic book, the modern protagonist is marooned first in Norse Myth and then in the Faerie Queen* itself.  @Patricia -  The protagonist  also uses syllogisms as a magical tool.. I know how much you love them :)By coincidence it is my current to-work-and-back audio-book (from audible in case anyone is interested).*anyone who likes this kind of thing - also see Inferno by Niven & Pournelle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(novel)) re-interpreting Dante from a modern comedic perspective.  ;I see a lot of references to hands in that story:  The hand of Nature.  The hand of God (as Joanna points out).  The hand of man.  The hands of the spirit/fairy world. ..and of course the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force. Things in the story are written specifically by hand (and the implication of the hand of god having written moving on). Hands are also referenced in the text as they seize, gripe, offer, pass, grasp, point, touch, pluck, restrain, clasp, draw and variously leave marks on skin, paper, souls, mortality etc.. Suitors kiss hands and would like to kiss 'any' of her hands. Hands (with opposable thumbs) are probably the most important feature that separates man from most beasts (Primates & Koalas etc.. excepted :) - they are one of the most human of symbols and are probably a universal basic (cave paintings in Neolithic Gemany and Australian bush rocks show hands); hands are frequent human focal elements for sculpture and painting.  Hands are manipulative, hands are dexterous and sinister, hands are clean and unclean, protective and belligerent. ...and of course, you need hands to hold a little baby.... ....You need hands to show the world you're happy  And you need hands when you have to stop the bus  But the hands we love so dear  Are the hands we love to hear  Are the hands that You give to us...

Tales of incarceration...  ;@Jeanmarie - thank you very much, a very useful summary and it does help - you know. ;I read it that attainment and the generation of beauty was more important than permanency. It is like building a sand sculpture - you work for hours to produce something beautiful and at the end (sometimes during the creation process) people admire it. You know that the tide will destroy it; and if you leave it then a child (or even adult) will kick it down within minutes of you walking away. It doesn't matter though because you have done it and it is beautiful - and part of the beauty is in the very transience of the object. All things die but for a while they are lovely. Now for the tricky part that you may criticise - If a child, especially one that you love, gets enjoyment from smashing it, then surely that just adds to the experience - better the child than the sun or the tide.  In the story, Hawthorne hints that the child kills the object because he is a child of strength rather than beauty, also because he is like his grandad. Doesn't that just mean that they are incapable of producing beauty; and possibly, but not necessarily, malicious when they disregard beauty. It is in their nature which is just different from his - they believe they are right in what they do and we should feel sorry for them, not angry.  After all - Owen got his goal after many false starts...and all butterflies are transient. ;I didn't see the inlaid image on the box as about the child because he was startled to see him - I didn't think Owen knew about the child at all (all a bit too earthy for him). I saw the inlay as a reference to Owen's own transcendence of earthly physical bounds.  I did wonder why it was of ebony and pearl.  Ebony is a strong, dense, beautiful dark wood. In this case it acts as a practical base for the image and presents a strong contrast between dark and light. Pearl is very interesting here - something beautiful made by ugly biology: A water mollusc (oyster - reproduction symbol) takes a bit of irritating base grit and through long and laborious effort makes it into a beautiful and precious 'jewel' - the pearl. It is probably not a coincidence that only a few oysters make pearls - most fail to transform grit into beauty. ;I've managed to see the 'before you read' video now and it is VERY clear that you could do one poem or story only - if that is the way you want to go... Hopefully all reviewers will watch the video :) ;Is this it? I looked it up based on your description - thanks Jennifer. http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/hawthorne-series-science-progress-and-human-nature ;I did wonder if this was an archaic use of 'eminent' as a noun.  If I have the timings right then this is set at least 20-30 years before Frankenstein, before standard terms would have been commonly used for scientists (or scientist-like people). I may be wrong but eminent works for me as a noun for such a person.  I can't prove any of this but I'm looking :) ;That one is OK I believe - try substituting 'width' for 'absorbing energy' - Still thinking about the 'eminent' though... ;Yes, that makes sense - thanks John. It says something that my brain was much more willing to squeeze eminent into being a noun than it was to let proficient be one - it just seems unwieldy - perhaps that gut feeling is why proficient in that sense is not in common use any more - my brain-gut interface is usually pretty average / sensitive to the zeitgeist :) ;I think almost all of the layers are deliberate - you can see from Alice, Dracula, Frankenstein, Hawthorne etc. that the authors are blatantly trying very hard to put references to other literature in there (Shakespeare cheek to  jowl  with nursery rhymes). They are chock-full of allusions to gods, religious events, political issues, and so many other literary tools that these concept-'philatelists' will certainly be putting more subtle stuff in there as well. These 'deeper' allusions will sometimes be obvious to us (because it still makes sense in a modern context) or cryptic (stuff so unusual or non-topical that we have to look hard and put it in context). So I think the 'hidden' meanings are put there as deliberate 'easter-eggs' for the target-reader to enjoy and the unsubtle (in their eyes) reader to miss :)These writers are all craftspeople - either because they are academic or because of their peers and  peculiar  personal circumstances (Stoker, Shelley) - so they almost certainly knew what they were doing with regard to symbolism; so I am convinced that they would not be putting a lot of unconscious symbology in there. The symbology is to my mind entirely cynical.  I was actually quite relieved to read that Poe  disliked  allegory - so his stories might conceivably be the richest hunting ground for unconscious / societal symbolism. He is also by far the easiest author to read from the selection to date because he is not trying to be clever in squeezing in as many external references as possible (I did wonder if his referential inclusions in the raven are actually a pastiche). I'm loving that I can't find thinly disguised sexual references in his stories - it's quite a relief (fnarr fnarr).I propose that this is actually the main practical reason for the layers. Most of these authors would not have 'got away with' the  explicitly  sexual, political or blasphemous  commentaries that all of these novels employ if it had been plainly  served.  The 'baked-in' innuendo is their way to make an R-rated thought acceptable to those that could not see it without help. Like the thin disguises in popular music (e.g. 'relax') - it doesn't always take a lot to get past the 'censors' if you are not blatant about it.Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but not when it is in a literary classic -   as Chekov says: ""If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there."". I think this is true for allusion and symbolism too - we are simply finding these things too easily otherwise.;Ha ha - just watched https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/lecture/44 - score !! ;p ;I'm sure that there are many opposing views and I would be interested in hearing those. Mainly because I am certainly not an expert and may be being overly pragmatic/cynical :) ...perfectly willing to hear that in the operating system of our brains there are many opportunities for trojans and ear-worms (!) - perhaps even independent of normal thought or function (..case of M. Valdemar anyone??). ;..and one immediately appears.  I just stood up and found ""coursera sera - whatever will be will be"" going through my head. Too much Poe!!!!! ;It is on the tip of my tongue, but I can't get the film 'Small Soldiers' out of the way to say it...;SPOILER* Oooo Ooooo.... is it Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers by Harry Harrison ?? That is the one I was trying to remember... Loooong time since I read it - but it fits your description (Short book rather than short story though) and I remember it being hilarious (when I was 15). Now I have to stop avoiding this essay... ;Just a suggestion - 1984 is a good read but have you considered Brave New World - Huxley - less slow and in some ways a related classic. What is it about (which book) Wells that you prefer to Bradbury? (I agree with this BTW - I find Bradbury generally a bit 'fuzzy' and 'pioneer-focus' - except 'the fruit at the bottom of the bowl' which feels like Poe :) - I'm hoping to be re-educated wrt Bradbury here, ) I'm sure you'd get lots of book recommendations if you could pinpoint the element that you like. From the Wells > Bradbury,  I'm guessing you might like John Wyndham - perhaps try The Chrysalids? ;My mother was a fantasy fan and her books started me off. So to find the real origin (our ancestors before that were largely illiterate - we were household servants, navvies and AgLab), I asked her what converted her to Fantasy/SF.  Apparently it was Edgar Rice Burroughs - she started on Tarzan and then wanted more; so she tried A Princess of Mars -  the John Carter Books - and progressed from there through Wells, Wyndham etc..When I came along she already had a good collection and I read those (and nagged her to give me pocket money to collect the Dr Who books - an easy win, what parent would say no to ""can I buy books please?"" :).So I started with Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke (Rendezvous with Rama - particularly influential for me), Wells,  Wyndham.When I expanded from YA books, I collected Edmund Cooper, King, James Herbert, Philip Jose Farmer, Piers Anthony, Anne McCaffery, Niven & Pournelle, John Norman (*cough*) ..and so started a lifelong obsession...No SciFi at school (we did Shakespeare, Hardy, Buchan, the Brontes) - but I did lend Niven & Pournelle's Inferno to my English teacher, and she lent me Dante's original (which was much too hard for me at the time).I've never actually read A princess of Mars so I am looking forward to coming full circle on that..!!!;Isn't that just so the origami unicorn can be left in the final scene to let him know that the cop had been there? Otherwise I saw it as the lowest step in a continuum of artifice of life forms - from origami to replicant. ;That's an interesting point. It might be partially solved by the thought that a review of a book should logically only contain external references to literature and the cultural background of the AUTHOR. In some ways that is a bit tricky, but all of the authors so far will have had access to the Bible and Shakespeare. Probably you can add Dante, Spencer, Cervantes, Chaucer to them (probably not to most of us though :). It might be harder to make a case for the religious books of other cultures (some more than others) and the same for the mythology. For example, I wouldn't expect most of the authors so far to be familiar with Australian or African origin myths. As we move to more recent authors and the pool of literature available to them, that will get trickier to judge. Sawyer/Huck, Kill/Mockingbird and Catcher/Rye might be fundamental to US writers but not the rest of the world. On the other hand - Quixote, Bond, Potter and Mulan might be pretty universally known :) All of the books on this course are from North Americans (mainly US) and North Europeans (mainly UK) and, small differences aside, the cultures are pretty similar, and have been dominated by Judeo-Christian imagery and media (at least for the period that these books cover) so common references of this kind are reasonably acceptable because the 'reasonably well-read author' will know them and may have used them as inspiration. That said - how many people have read Leviticus (please do - its a blast) or Troilus and Cressida (ditto)? So obscure references are a bit tricky to judge... they shouldn't dominate and should be explained IMHO. ;Me too, I have a 'purloined letter' So next week I'm looking forward to a comparison of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds with Harry Harrison's Technicolor Time Machine. irony alert :) ;I'm not sure there has been a film of TTM - definitely a radio play (which was very good).  My favourite bit was the paradox with the naming of the son of Erik the Red. If you are mixing it up with the Hot Tub Time Machine (saw it on a plane) - not the best film I've seen... Neither was the remake of Time Machine with whatshername the singer. The original though with the shop dummy and the book choice question... Now you're talking... ...as for JW-WotW - dangerous ground.. I prefer all the voices in the original, but the remake did have some nice musical tweaks... Film-wise, the Pal original was frankly 'bobbins'... Tom Cruise's remake was actually pretty good; and the 'it's not WotW honest' Independence Day was quite amusing - until Goldblum had a good idea. I very much liked Orson Wells' radio version too. Comparing the two... Hmmm...... ;I'm not marking down for that although I would prefer that they cite the original references from those sources. I'm quite flexible with the citations section since there are lots of different styles on here and as long as they are rational / consistent I'm not worried. Formally speaking a Wikipedia or database reference should have a specific date/version/revision because they are transient ...but we don't have a lot of space and the date is obvious...! ;I found Hawthorne a bit flowery for me (especially Rappuchini :) - except the 'Artist' and I didn't feel confident that I could match that one to any Poe (except by shoehorn into Valdemar). I really really wanted to do 'The Raven' - but I was too intimidated. Hopefully we won't get ""you should have done both authors - 1"" comments tap-tap-tapping on our door. ;Ahh... No-one expects the Spanish Inquisition... ;I'm not really convinced by this. How many of our ancestors wanted to die? It is not decency, what is decent about dying? If you took that argument to its extreme then genocide, murder or suicide would be the most decent human things to do - of course they are not. If someone eats healthily, exercises and thereby extends their lifespan, is that bad? If someone else chooses to smoke, sunbathe, overeat and eschews fitness, does that make them virtuous because they are shortening their time? I think this argument is confusing the extension of life with the mechanism. You are condemning 'artificial' extension of life Because of science and the artificial scientific methods that predate formal science (e.g. agriculture, sanitation,  construction) most humans life much longer now than our hominid ancestors.  Without wheat, potatoes, rice, maize and other artificial crops, most of the humans that have lived so far would have died at a much earlier age (and most would never have existed). Without sanitation, inoculation, surgery, and 'minor' artifices (glasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs etc.) many people would have a much poorer life and some would have died younger. So what is the line? If I can quickly turn part of your argument upside down: If tomorrow, a cure for all cancers through nanotechnology becomes available. Would you make it illegal because extending life is immoral? Some religions would say yes - I would personally view them as immoral. ;I agree completely - you can significantly extend your life by calorie restriction (it works on all kinds of species). ...but as the old joke goes: does it really extend your life or does it just feel like it... :) ;OK  6= 4+ (sqrt ((4x4)/4)) ;"

For one person it was a dystopia.  Because of the point of view of the reader/author, you see it from the main character / your own perspective in a current society; and label it a dystopia. The reader then sympathises with the character(s) that consider their own selfish desires to be more important than everyone else's. One character in conflict with a whole society. Then the book switches to bring in another society and the reader's sympathy swings as the utopia becomes a dystopia for more characters - but ONLY when the two worlds interact. I won't give away the ending but the final resolution has always appealed to me (and was brought to mind when I saw the hippie colonies in Chiapas :) Nice to know that in the Arts community they are frequently served together (Scotch egg and baked Alaska ?

Kudos... ;Hi Georgy, The same is true in English. A master is someone who is good at something - I.e. someone who has mastered the craft. Master craftsman.  Master of Science/Arts/Philosophy (MSc, MA, MPhil).  Master piece - something made to attain mastery of a craft (can I recommend the beginning of the brilliant Titus Groan - Mervin Peake for a good introduction to this use) The use of master as a boss is presumably just an extension of this - control over people - sorry my ontological training is in another area :) - as in 'master of the house'. A young child is also often called a master (and in formal/archaic letters sometimes has the suffix esquire [esq]- which means small knight) - not sure where this comes from (mastery of walking or language perhaps because toddlers don't have it). I believe master is always secular (non-religious) - but would love to have exceptions quoted back at me ! The formal distaff of master is mistress, but that's not always as popular nowadays :) ;Yes a ship's master is its captain - they are interchangeable in English. ;It seems to give a little leeway - I noticed this a couple of weeks ago when i was poking around for the essays to mark and added a fullstop in my essay to see what it would say and it allowed it -   about 10 mins after the deadline.;I agree with the others that there was too much biography (I fell into the same trap - same reason, so I understand the temptation). I liked the whole personification of a meaningless Death - that made me think with new insight (I actually went off down the road of the Final Destination films and wondered if a capricious and/or malicious Death works too). I would have liked more of this instead of the bio - especially expanding on the 'prize'.  @Poulomi - Death is most certainly a her - Please see Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics :) ; and the bit in Pratchett when Susan takes over (hang on - Susan and her dimension hopping Grandfather - Death is really - William Hartnell - Nooooo!);Sorry Paloumi - The'death is a her' was supposed to be lighthearted   - Sandman is a high-art graphic novel where the personifications of Death, Delirium etc are quite quirky - Death is usually a goth-type (e.g.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_At_Death%27s_Door). I could have just as easily referenced Death as a 'he'  in  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Pale_Horse  ; number one in a series of books about mythological personifications (by Piers Anthony) - He does Death, the Fates (Lachesis, Atropos and the other one :), time (Chronos) etc.. Actually   picked up a lot about myths from his books when I was younger.The William Hartnell reference was to the first  Dr Who. Death in the Pratchett books has a granddaughter called Susan, so did Dr Who at the beginning; and further similarities are clearly not a coincidence.Thanks for the info on  the Hindu pantheon.  My impression also  is that these gods are  not too clear about gender  in many cases. If I might venture a thought - in the case of SF in general  and the Poe / Hawthorne books in particular, wouldn't they be under the influence of Ganesh (science &  knowledge) as muse?P.S.  I have a fair few statues of him/her (bought a new one last week in the Batu Caves - Biggest Vishnu statue there  I have ever seen!!!).   ;I liked the exploration of the possibility that the wife was a witch and the cat was her familiar - driving him mad by actions that neither we nor he are aware of in the text given. Being killed by an iron axe is a very witchy end ...and the fire.. hmm... I don't think I believe it but I'm going back in to look - which is after all the point of these essays. Thank you.;Love it - just love it - yes the meter goes askew in the last two as you knew; and the content is contorted but it's brilliantly reported..   ..damn.. infected... Seriously, this made my day!;I quite liked the concept of 'hysterical fixation' as a replacement for paraformaldehyde :)I think this is exactly what the hypnotism is supopsed to be doing here - suspending animation by psychic fixation - so I can go for that one.In the garden, most botanists would think of Nitrogen fixation before carbon fixation - did any of the plants have pods (most nitrogen fixing plants do)? The descriptions of the plants were mainly the inflorescences and runners/vines as I remember it - most carbon fixation is done in leaves and nitrogen in roots, it is the eyes that get fixed by flowers (that is why they are there - to fix the gaze of pollinators, mainly bees). - so I'm not so convinced by this one.I think you could have used visual fixation as a broad thesis more successfully on all three and made it more about attention/distraction/mesmerising   - the chemical science stuff is cute but it is a bit tenuous really :)You missed out the Artist of the Beautiful - I would have thought your bioscience room-mate would immediately have thought of a way to fixate a butterfly that fits into the sublimation of desire that the Prof saw - as the Smiths put it in their 'poetry' ""you can pin and mount me like a butterfly"" - more entomology than etymology there though..I enjoyed your essay, but i can see why others didn't.. it's a bit 'out there' and I doubt Hawthorne would 'get' any of the science / fixative references (except for my sticking butterflies to cork).;Just in case I was too obscure - the reference about the 'pin and mount me like a butterfly' is from a notoriously miserable 80s group -  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuWZEhbe8x8  . I was being a bit  facetious (with genuinely positive  intent though).Histological fixation is pretty old, certainly before 1900 - I need to look into that :);I can't see any spelling mistakes   - apart from the 'z' in characterises (JOKE!). The grammar seems fine to me as well, sometimes a bit clumsy in terms of flow (especially the last sentence); but I'm no expert on grammar.I like the concept and was tempted to tackle this theme as well. I didn't see Owen as an artist so I wouldn't have contrasted them so strongly - he is such a good scientist that it looks like art. To modify Clarke's third law: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (art)."".;After seeing the amazing things posted here I feel very pedestrian and dull (confirmed by peer 1 :) -   but here it is:- I was making a foray into external factors affecting the poem; but I think I should have stuck with the internal stuff like I usually do - because the external stuff   seemed to be the main bugbear for the peers (I think).==SCORE 5==Annabel Lee is commonly claimed as Poe's devotional epitaph to  his wife,  Virginia Clemm Poe  who died in 1847; two years before the poem was completed.    Virginia was married as a child of 13 evoking the  early stanzas  [1]; and in 1955,  Nabokov promoted a paedophilic  reading as inspiration for 'Lolita' [2]. Perhaps  not  the degenerate focus that Poe intended.This was Poe's last poem. His ex-employer (Thompson) exchanged it for expenses ($5) on the very trip where Poe mysteriously died [3]. This devalues the poem and belies its devotional interpretation. Also, Poe was 27 when he married and certainly not a child [1], so an unadulterated autobiography is not convincing.  The ""once upon a time' [4] beginning immediately warns us that this is fantasy; the 'kingdom by the sea' suggests a suspension of time, place and credibility.  Even Annabel's own name ""Lee"" (the place that the wind hits last), questions the mechanism of her death.   The narrator progressively decends to increasingly degenerate  observations ending in his lying down with Annabel Lee in her  tomb  [5]. This is not the only lying in evidence - instead of an epitaph, our unreliable (insane) narrator relates an unhealthy  and apparently unwelcome [6]  obsession with a very young girl culminating in emotional necrophilia.   The first two stanzas viewed in this context are unsubstantiated wish fulfilment easily interpreted as 'stalking'.The language overwhelmingly drowns us in an amoral and unknowable sea of alliterative sibilance and  sussuration  [7], wave-like rhythms, and  nautical allusions (e.g. ""bore"" - kinsmen as   impersonal tidal  wave [6]).   Imagery is predominantly cold (dark,  windy,night,  tombs); even references to brightness (stars,  moon) are heatless luminescences. The only contrasting  images (seraphic:  fire-angels, dragons, serpents) represent discarded morality, suppressed guilt, and rejection of divine retribution.  The poem is most certainly not a romantic documentation of mourning and devotion; but a dark tale of fantasy and obsession.==cited==[1] ""I was a child and  she was a child""- Stanza 2.[2] Letter  (1947)  V.  Nabokov to E. Wilson,  ""I am writing... a short novel about a man who liked little girls ...The Kingdom by the Sea"".[3] Letter (1849) J. Thompson to R. Griswold.[4]  ""many and many a year ago""  - stanza 1.[5] ""all the night-tide, I lie down by the side...  In her tomb""- Stanza 6.[6] ""her highborn kinsman came  And bore her away from me"".- Stanza 3.[7] ""shut her up in a sepulchre"", ""dissever my soul from the soul"".  - Stanza 3/5.==FORM==(3)peer 1      Your grammar and sentence structure are impeccable.

The overall score was 5, which I am obviously very happy about.. As for Dr Who, oh...yes...., I was a member of both the Dr Who International Fan Club (DWIFC) AND the Dr Who Appreciation Society (DWAS) when I was 10 - just before they amalgamated :) . Which is/was your Dr? ;Topic-shmopic - we're talking Who :). From the current run, Tennant was my boy, but my original Dr. was Pertwee (Spearhead from Space). Although I think Baker probably had most of the best rounded plots in TOS (especially look out for the whole season based on the ark in space). The Dr was often a little bit loose with companions in the original series (especially early on) and a fair amount of the time they were just colleagues or locals (like Leela, Benson, Jamie etc.). I think my favourite companion is still Sarah-Jane Smith. It was often very detective-like and 'did a Christie-plot-ski-ramp' (last para has to get us back on topic right? :) where the answer to the detecting problem was fantastic (Peladon, Daemons, Robots of Death etc..).  ;...oh and Troughton once met Rapunzel (not Rabkin's Rapunzel though - my Dr was sexless - I think Megan agrees :). ;Rousseau clearly never saw a troop of Baboons, wild-dogs, chimps or any other social mammals :) More (less?) seriously, this isolation = degeneration would be a 'Lord of the Flies' approach. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies Putting the two together you might be interested in Primal by Robin Baker http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Robin_Baker His sperm wars book was very good, his fiction much less so (but still in this vein). ;The story reminded me for a lot of obvious (and not so obvious reasons) of the classic SF novel Dark Universe by Galouye.  If you enjoyed the concepts in this story and would like a more detailed treatment from the perspective of the 'blind' then I can highly recommend this book. I found it quite hard to get hold of but it is also on Audible with an introduction by Dawkins (!?!). As for the story - I'm seeing religion everywhere. Noooooo - what has this course done to me....?!? ;Depends really - I do suspect that a hefty inclusion of external issues rather than literary ones might be reviewed less well; I'm also guessing that a historical review of ability issues at the time might not go down brilliantly either.  BUT - if this one really tickles your fancy then you could always consider it a 'burner' essay and take the risk - I'm presuming you don't NEED the score and I'm sure you could make it very readable.  On the other hand, you could write it literally instead of literarily for your own pleasure and post it here for comments and submit a second one if you had the inclination...??  Hmm.. Bet that doesn't really help much... ;To those on this thread - just to make a 'public service' comment that this week we are doing:    Wells     The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, ""The Country of the Blind,"" ""The Star"" NOT War of the Worlds, Time Machine, Things to Come, etc (although I would have loved to).(This is not intended to be patronising and it is not a spoof - just helpful because I can empathise with your disappointment - really - if you are uncertain, please check the Syllabus page).;Hi there, I've done a first pass with minimal suggested changes (although I rewrote the end because on a phone I couldn't edit sensibly :) Also, I wouldn't start a formal sentence with 'because', but I have kept as much of your text as I think possible.

Because this is a course about literature and [has] grammar and structure in [writing] as one of [the] grading point[s], beside[s] the evaluation and critique from peer evaluation, maybe it [would] be valuable if some student[s] in the course that [are both] [n]ative speaker[s] and fluent in English share some of their knowledge and experience in English to improve the [E]nglish of [those] student[s] that [do not] have [E]nglish [##] as their native/first [language] ( [such as] me).Hopefully we can improve our [writing] in [E]nglish together, especially for the next assignment.   ([B]ecause I always receive 1 point in grammar, please can you grade the writing above between 1 and 3 to show my errors :)    ;I'd also split it up into shorter sentences! ... Also 'such as me' is very very informal - but that part of the post is too. ;Well formally it would be 'such as I' but that sounds very formal. I would be tempted to put the thought elsewhere in the text.  'English is not my native language along with many others in this course..'. ;I can't find the gesture you are describing in chapter 11. The gorilla counts off his 5 fingers and makes the link between them (he is also a 5-finger man) that is different from the animals 'raised' from hoofed animals. A bit later, the gorilla is asked how long he has been there - he holds up 3 fingers (which isn't explained then). I can't find anything with 3 missing fingers - I was wondering which fingers it was because if the missing fingers are 2 middle and thumb, then that is the sign of the cuckold, or the evil eye; either might be interesting but I can't see the description :( ;Thanks Daniel. I think it is a kind of greeting in that the Gorilla lets Edward see how many fingers he has by counting them off slowly and querying that he do the same... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, eh? The gorilla is saying 'I have 5 fingers, how many do you have?'.  Edward makes the right response (I'm the same as you), but doesn't fully understand why until later when he sees those with fewer fingers. The gorilla then keeps on telling the other people that Edward is also a '5-man' like him, as it is important to him that Edward is similar (and possibly that some of the others are different because they come from sheep etc. with fewer fingers). I think it IS important that the gorilla makes this link so strongly. This is like some of the reasons discussed in the forum and essays about 'the birthmark' (the hand is critical to humanity). Possibly (at a really really long shot) - something like in Animal Farm - Orwell (2-legs bad, 4-legs good --> 4-legs good, 2 legs better) might be at work here.. Does finger number define a 'class'?  I'd like to see a surfing Gorilla though - great balance I'd think.... ;Lots of animals actually make and use tools, from chimps to birds and through to octopi - so man 'was' the tool using animal back before science observed that he wasn't unique in that respect (e.g back in Well's day). A modern writer of Well's equivalent scientific credibility probably wouldn't have made that mistake. Interestingly, people of his day would also have pointed out the opposable thumb as something very special and would possibly have predicted an animal with two opposable thumbs to become the evolutionary 'master-race', we now know that is not true (no worries there - you need 2 opposable thumbs AND a good diet :).The point about mimicking the physical aspect of the visible god is interesting but I think this equation of looks=divinity is largely peculiar to a small number of religious sects and their descendants (e.g. the Judao-Christian-Moslem tribe) - and those sects of course are doing exactly the opposite - imagining God in the image of themselves (or actually mainly their dad, sometimes their mum at a push). I actually think this may be one of the core jokes/digs in the book, Wells is knocking the whole concept of the anthropomorphic God of the monoatheists.Many polytheistic religions are much more up front about this issue - they have gods that specialise in tasks just like they do on Earth (Norse, Roman, Greek, Egyptian); not all of whom are a physiognomy fashion goal (e.g. Sutekh, Ganisha, Dionysus, Loki [really a giant]), Many religions do not have physical form fashion as a core tenet at all - e.g Buddism, wicca - and have enlightenment purely as a goal in itself, not attainment of a bodily standardisation.I can imagine a Wells/Lovecraftian Chthulu fusion where the number of fingers gets completely out of control...  ;Welll... we are singing from much the same song sheet.. but I would change:""bleak, mechanistic universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for  any  god""  to:""wonderful, knowable and democratising mechanistic  universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for  any  god""--As for the ""inferiority of other races was evidenced in their inferior tools"", it is interesting to me that a lot of apocalyptic fiction since the 60s has side-swiped or centralised the issue that we ('industrialised society') do not know how to make tools any more. Our society has become so internally co-dependent and in (most countries) reliant on mechanisation; that 'come the plague/nuclear/weather/oil/zombie apocalypse..' we would be hard pushed to make even the most simple of weapons or staples - could YOU make a functional bow with your bare hands?  My first contact with this concept was in the brilliant Survivors - Terry Nation (great book, better sequel,  stunning but sadly dated original TV series,  so-so remake [No that is NOT Tom Price!!!]). Wherein they point out soap, batteries, hearing aids and then move on to everything else we cannot make individually..My ancestors made flint axes from local materials and at a push I could do it too. I know enough chemistry to make soap from first principles (using burnt seaweed and a slaughtered pig - didn't say it would be nice soap); I could possibly make copper and bronze but I probably couldn't find the ores (without a very good book); and I certainly couldn't make steel on my own. So as tool makers we are now pretty low on the pecking order as individuals. Any smart person knows that racism is stupid arrogant nonsense (unless perhaps we find a neanderthal?! or uplift a bonobo [or toaster] then bets might be off) - but the tool-use/make difference in Well's time accorded to race was really not down to hands, brains, colour or any other triviality - it was down entirely to one thing - reading and writing, especially across generations. (Wo)Man is the recording animal.    ;Unfortunately not so much under debate as you might think. Most wars and extensive disasters where society is not immediately reimposed lead to a very rapid breakdown in social mores where murder, rape, torture and other 'forbidden' practices are very commonly observed. Consider Nanjing, Vietnam, Kosovo etc etc ad nauseum...Society likes to pretend these things do not happen (not by our country certainly) and history often covers up abuse to the level of denial (examples with-held). On a minor level we make these myths of selflessness and individual altruism and promote them as the norm (e.g. the myth of 'women and children first', 'the captain goes down with his ship' - there are recent papers showing this doesn't happen and women and children do far worse in shipwrecks - the crew come off best in survival statistics (especially the captain).Sorry guys but civilisation and social control is the only thing keeping us from barbarism - possibly only by a few hours (for example if oil suddenly ran out - projections suggest about 48 hrs to collapse our current civilisation).On a lighter (!) note - Chrysalids is fantastic Javier, good call by Elizabeth - I'd start there ..you might find Kraken Wakes a bit annoyingly British at the beginning - it is quite terribly tiffin and tea - also a very good book though - us Brits do excel at end-of-the-world stuff ;p.     ;Thanks Elizabeth, very thought provoking, hope you don't mind if I respond to defend my thesis :)I don't want to put the links here, but a quick google search on [riot rape] leads to a lot of recent examples all over the world; so I'm not convinced it is a military issue (although, yes, mine were military but I was trying not to use anything too recent). The power-cuts/brownouts of the 70s oil crisis saw a big crime rise including violent crime in several countries.When society breaks down (and it is pretty close to the edge in locations in most countries a lot of the time, triggers are not difficult to find), most people hunker down and retreat from society but a few can cause significant damage.BTW - There are quite a few (ancient) societies that fell over from within (Mayans, Greenland Vikings, Early US settlers [Norse and other Europeans], Easter Island, Anasazi). I agree that in a failing society the military would fall early -   because they wouldn't get paid, would have lost their core function, and would need to look after their own. It might be interesting to see who died last in those societies.... and how... I'm sure someone knows.Now for some tiffin....;Yes!! Read triffids again - there is a lot more to it as an adult - I try to read it every year (because I'm a sad obsessive :).;Yes, I smiled about that too :) I found the physics quite hard to fault although I thought the timing was quite condensed and I'm not sure that I was convinced by the momentum issues in Neptune vs the 'star'.  Although - it must have been  going pretty fast hmmmmm... Quite a lot of coincidences but....  I've settled on this one for my essay. ;The ending is refreshingly nihilistic :) - there is a lot about the ending of this story that reminds me of 'On the Beach' - by Shute and 'Down to a Sunless Sea' by Graham (the British miserable ending, not the sappy happy-ending US re-write).  @Greg - I disagree - I think the naming has to be very precise; but I'll have to wait for the essay to explain because I'm still trying to work out how to say it in less than 1000 words :);"

Of course, I also adore his other classics, especially Pet Semetary.  ;I love the Song of Ice and Fire series! I feel like I should re-read them because there is so much going on, but the list of books I want to read is already long enough. It's a conundrum most readers are faced with.Since I purchased a Kindle I've gone crazy downloading books. At first I was against the idea of an e-reader, but I'm travelling right now and carting around twenty pounds of books didn't sound like the best of ideas. Amazon has tons of free stuff, I even have a couple textbooks downloaded for GRE test preparation. At the moment I'm switching between  Sons and Lovers by D.H. Lawrence, Symbolic Logic by Lewis Carroll, and The Grammar of English Grammars by Goold Brown.;Thanks for sharing, definitely sounds like an interesting read. Congrats on getting published!;They're definitely watching. Educated people are more difficult to control (particularly the people who find intrinsic worth in education). We might be safe in a literature class, but look out if you sign up for At Home Bombs 101 :P;Great analysis! Working in a similar vein I see a lot of the tales as a reflection of the inner workings of the individual. Like Abigail mentioned, most of the characters are fairly one dimensional and are only shown as being all bad or all good. In reality, people are multifaceted (good people sometimes do bad things and vice versa) and our concepts of good and bad are much more complex.In The Cat and Mouse Partnership the mouse is the industrious and prudent nature of the individual. She is the voice in everyone's head saying, ""We ought to save this for later."" The cat, on the other hand, is the irresponsible side of the individual; he takes the path of least resistance, lying when it suits him and interested only in instant gratification. At the end of the story when the cat devours the mouse it's as if the immoral, hedonistic side has taken over. Both aspects are manifested in many people's personalities and it is important to keep a healthy balance between the two. Too much indulgence can create an unproductive villain while too much focus on duties and responsibilities can make a person provincial and limited in outlook.;I take a less symbolic view and think the inclusion of royalty adds to the entertainment value. I think a lot of it has to do with using stories as a form of escapism, royalty is like their version of celebrity. It's typical of television today: People are obsessed with the rich and famous. Popular television constantly focuses on beautiful characters who live in nice houses (Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City, The Real Housewives of where ever) because people like to be taken away from their ordinary lives. Same as with Grimm's fairytales, we also enjoy seeing our celebrities self destruct and act immorally.;I don't think so. I know there was lots of speculation, but people often seek to demonize those who transcend our ideas of normal. Carroll was a strange guy. In one realm he was a bookish mathematician with a stutter and in another an author of delightfully silly fiction. He was close friends with a lot of children well into their adulthoods (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll/Child_friends_and_adult_friends);  some have even refuted the idea Carroll was ever inappropriate in his affections.;I think you're on to something here. Throughout the story Alice goes through many physical changes, even questions if she is still the same person she was when she began her journey. The them of the self being preserved through time is touched upon in many different ways. Time is a really slippery topic; we all have an understanding of time, but when questioned directly about what time really is (a thing, a property, a tool, a human invention?) many people are at a loss for words.""What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know."" --St. Augustine;I found this first essay pretty tough too! At first it seemed like each topic I chose was too broad or too obvious and I couldn't delve into it properly with the 320 word restraint. After re-writing the entire thing for the fourth time I decided even though it's not profound it's good enough and I hit submit. This first essay felt like a practice run to me; I think after we get them evaluated the next essays will be easier since we'll have a sense of what's expected.;"

Martin first of all presents morality as a subjective idea rather than a strict unwavering code.   His characters move through the world and as they do you see there core values and ideals change.   He also implies that a persons base sense of morality is shaped by many different outside forces such as religion, politics (or house loyalties), ethnicity, and culture.   These same views have never been more substantial than in todays modern world with our ideals of multi-culturalism and global citizenry.   It seems as our wold gets smaller Martin's world, and the realm of epic fantasy itself, is expanding and may eventually become as large a reality itself.;Hello Carol,I have read the entire series to date and I have to say Martin's style of narrative is one of the greatest of it's merits.   The focus on the individual players allows for the reader to not only learn to view Martin's world from the perspective of it's inhabitants, but also to understand the deeper motivations of the players actions.   This combination adds a drama element not traditionally present in fantasy that causes the reader to become more intensely immersed in the story.   I would even go as far as to say that Martin provides a new take on escapism.   ;James I have a theory about the shadowy magic system, which I will not go into detail on because you are not currently up to date with the series and I don't want to ruin it for anyone, that follows the line of thought that the essence of the supernatural elements in this series relates to the final outcome in such a way that to reveal the nature of how and why they occur before certain key events in the story would allow the reader too much insight into the conclusion.   However I would encourage you to read all of the volumes more than once because on my second read through I discovered that several small events, that seemed to be filler at first read, turned out to foreshadow major events (for example an understanding of the Frey's 'king of the crossing game' can mayhaps give insight into predicting their actions and motivations).;I had to check my free kindle store version against the text linked on the course page the translations are very different and some of the titles didn't match at all.   In one story (The Wolf and the Seven Goslings) my version had the main characters as goats instead of geese and I almost missed the connection.   So my advice is to check the text against the first paragraph of each story. Mine were in a relativity similar order, there is a good chance you have them all in your translation so I would check again.;"

It seems like they get the most boring sounding people on purpose.;'1984' and 'Brave New World' are studied together probably more than any other two books in the genre as they essentially present two sides of the same coin and have elements that closely represent modern society. In the Information Age '1984' is relevant to the social climate in parts of Asia and the Middle East, as in these areas heavy censorship and tight control of media are prevalent. Conversely Huxley's 'Brave New World' is representative of the social climates of Western Europe and North America where we are flooded with so much information through free media that creates essentially the same effect as the aforementioned censorship. In any case these two novels represent the archetypal basis of dystopian science fiction and are definitely worth a read.;The books that got me started on Science fiction were ""Starship Troopers', 'A Princess of Mars', 'Ringworld', and 'Brave New World' all of which came in a box of paperbacks I got for 50cent at a yard sale when I was in 4th grade.

In the works you mention the memories themselves are not as important as the clarity they lend to the overall land scape of the story.  In 'A Scanner Darkly' the main actors are hidden from perception by technology that conceals them by overloading the senses with too much information, distracting from the truth of what is hidden beneath, and thereby mirroring the perception of the protagonist.   In 'Minority Report' we are introduced to a world that is presented as entirely deterministic however, later we discover this may not be the fact. In 'Total Recall' we don't know what memories we can trust.   In all cases it's not what we see that makes the story, it's what we don't see.   In the same way It's not what the author says in his novels the we need to pay close attention to, it's what he doesn't say. Do androids dream of electric sheep? Do dreams indicate the presence of a soul?

Wonder when they returned to favour as human companions and mice killer machines;I don't know if it would count as cat-companion, but a cat mentions a mistress in The Bremen Town Musicians:""Now that I am old my teeth are getting blunt, and I would rather sit by the oven and purr than run about after mice, and my mistress wanted to drown me;"";"

Fantasy typically involves a setting that reflects fuedalism or other historical eras).And recognizing that the distinction is not always so clear.In earlier posts I mentioned the argument that Star Wars is Fantasy rather than SF.

I still consider it part of the SF sub-group of speculative fiction, but that relies on the not-strong argument that it is a far-future setting.   Perhaps the stronger argument is that, like much good SF, it provokes thought about our philosophies of society.;Kim, thanks for the link re  blog post  - very insightful!;I would nominate Peter S.

Kids were the most preacious treassure for the king so for me the fact that the king agrees to sacrifice their sons in reward to john's faithfulness to him shows how gratefull and concious he was about john and the sacrifice he did for the king so he could be safe and happy.It was very surprising for me when the queen also agreed thinking that she was not as involved with john as the king, but truth is john also save her from death when she danced at her wedding. I also feel important that the king tests his queen to see her reaction about the sacrifice. That proves how the queen also had a kind and grateful heart about john's sacrifice for them and their happyness. Regardless of all i think these fairytales are very intense, cruel , deep and shoking... but im kinda understanding what means to protect kids from reality and what is it to expose them to reality. I feel that is the main point of grimm's brothers with their tales. Life could be as dreamful as a fairytale and as cruel too.;I think you are right. For me it has been unbeliavable to think these tales were for kids to teach them and I never thought about the historical context when they were written.

If you don't do what you were suppossed to you die, or you lose something that you will never get back. Very intransigent.;I felt it more as an example of how happiness is something different for everyone. Most of us believe happiness is to be rich, get marry (hopefully being in love), have power and a recognized name. This is what society teaches you since you are born. Is mostly impossible for people to understand others who would not consider this things to be happy in life. Truth is I've seen: the richer you are, the poorer your soul is, the less happy you are.As the story goes you can see how all the men who trade things to Hans, knew exactly they were fooling him. Hans never undestood this because he trusted, maybe feeling everyone would think as he did. He was not happy carrying all those heavy things, because those things were not filling his needs on his way back home, so for him there was no point on carrying them. They were not worthy. The whole way back home the challenge for him was to be able to do it without hunger or thirst. At the end none of the things he got on his way helped him not being thirsty or hungry. He was happy because he couldnt believe how all these people he knew on his way were helping him on his problems, he felt he was blessed. At the end i guess if he would have felt hungry or thirsty again, probably he would have found a job and work again to have food and a place to stay, as simple as the basic things we need to live.;Thanks for sharing those wonderful wise verses. It is always a pleassure when they come meet you on our way. Is like a blessing.I think Hans did not feel the gold as a reward( or his fruit), only the fact that he got something in exchange of his loyal service was. I think he had an inner simplicity that guided him to be happy and feel gratefull everytime he felt the need of something and someone came to ""help him"" out. Maybe his duty was only to arrive home save and healthy after all the time being away from it.When i first read it, i was wondering where was his stupidity gonna lead him and after finishing it, i felt a little embarassed with myself for thinking he was stupid.I realized how we sometimes feel or consider people stupid just because they dont see the things as we do or they dont value things as we do.This is the main reason why I ended up liking this fairytale a lot.;Sorry guys, but from all the stories ive read so far, this is the one I haven't understand at most.

Did you guys notice that all of these animals from the list were listed like a chain of food? the first after the cock could have eaten him, and so on till the las one who could have eaten all of them... maybe this means nothing, but still why do they suddenly appear on the story and make company to the sad cock..?;"

Nationalism is not a stricted related thing to anitsemitism. As I read in some comments above,is true that   nationalism is a term used by more than just germany during history. I recomend you should read more about other countries.I do not think and feel an intemption of ""subconcious"" politic influence on the fairy tales at all. Also if you felt that way I dont see nationalism as a bad thing either. People naturally feel the need to belong to something or somewhere, so as being part of a religion, so as being part of a specifical style of music, so as try to maintain a certain language from the ancestors, etc. The problem remains when people try to adjust other people to their rules, or their way of living life or their believings.Is true Germany had a very strong period where nationalism was the main argument to manipulate people for certain behaviour.

It's true that in the past technology was limited and even simple things like cell phones and even in some cases computers seemed liked it was truly out there. Science or better the honest pursuit of truth is limited by reality, But science fiction is the imagination of science and it is only limited by the authors imagination. I think that the more truth we discover the more room we make for some truly imaginative science fiction.   Science fiction grows with true science. As science finds what once was thought to be fiction as truth , the science fiction authors are pushed and challenged to keep things moving forward.The awesomeness of it is found in the potential for some science fiction to become science non-fiction.That my view on it all ;I think one of Sci-Fi's obstacles nowadays is that readers are very science savvy; enough not to be impressed by technobabble. Another issue would be, as a science-savvy reader, I'd be curious about how things work, and getting an unsatisfactory explanation might make it harder to suspend my disbelief.;I did, in fact, think about looking into Audible. The problem I ran into was that either they didn't have the book I was looking for, or they had multiple versions and I couldn't tell which one I needed. And you're right -- it would get pretty expensive. However, I have a terrible audio book habit already, and part of me doesn't mind feeding it with classics for a class. The trick is making sure that I'm getting the same electronic copy as the audio copy I'm listening too, so I can look up quotes and references later. Audio books are much easier on my eyes, but more difficult for me to take notes with. And no page numbers, of course. :D;Similarly, I would call ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" a dystopian SF, but ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"" by Starhawk is dystopian fantasy, even though Starhawk tries to build on the world of Handmaiden's Tale.Thinking about it, though it was clunky in places, the thing that really delighted me about The Fifth Sacred Thing was the tension between the imperfect yet Utopia-seeking community of the north which focuses on co-operation, equality, and non-violence, and the Dystopian, rigidly stratified theocracy in the south - and the fact that it was through non-violent means that the southern forces were either repelled or persuaded to defect. It's really rare to have creative non-violent protagonists win the day.  Though Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is set in the aftermath of the so-called ""terrorist attack"" which involved some kind of biological weaponry, it's always struck me as more along the speculative fiction-fantasy area of the spectrum than sci-fi, as there's no real discussion of that or other technology.

He had been called back to the farm to work before he could finish his schooling the session before, but he missed the school badly.  He begged the farmer to allow him to go back to school, and the farmer allowed it. Pavel was happy! When Pavel got there, he found that all of the students were farther along than he, as it took him so long to come from the farm. Pavel loved the school, and he had written his assignments when he was there before. He asked the students if they thought it fair for him to turn in his assignments as he had done them before, and they said........;I find the tendency to ghettoise a load of fiction that would have just been on the SF&F shelves in the library in my youth as ""Young Adult"". I'm just not a fan of the idea that we need to categorise books this way. Kids will read to their own level, and adults will tend to steer clear of some truly cook books that are labelled YA. My discovery of the YA shelves was by accident, and I've found a load of books there that are just as clever, witty, thought provoking and absorbing as anything in the ""adult"" SF&F shelves. There are books on the ""adult"" shelves that have adolescent protagonists, and books on the ""YA"" shelves with adult protagonists. The categorisation seems entirely random.So nowadays I look at the YA shelves as well.  ;Kim, have you tried any Tanith Lee?   Also, I agree on Tamora Pierce and Jane Yolen as phenomenal writers.   Pierce's books make fantastic audio books for commutes.I read Mists of Avalon in 3rd grade (hey, I was bored and needed something to read), so by the time I stumbled across Heinlein in middle school I was a little less shocked at the sexy times and more going ""ewww"" at the incest.   Most avid readers in about the same age group as myself that I've talked to jumped from kids books to Anne Rice or Anne McCaffrey (I went the Pern route myself), we didn't really have access to ""YA"" books.   That being said I read a large number of ""YA"" titles and found some are just put there b/c they are PG in content (no graphic sex or profanity), and others are put there because they focus on teen characters often with a teen audience in mind... however if some of them are very graphic (The House of Night series doesn't shy away from teen's getting on).Confession time, I judge a library by if they have a dedicated SciFi/Fantasy section.   I'm a librarian and I still do this.   Why?   Because I know exactly where to go if I have no clue what to read and grab something random off the shelf.   Since my current library pulled the SciFi and Fantasy out of the main stacks into their own section their circulation stats have skyrocketed, so I must not be the only one.;Speculative Fiction is a meta category, but that doesn't stop Utopian/Distopian fiction from being speculative.;Fair enough.   I have to side on the ""it could be either"" argument - in part depending on the concept of the utopia or distopia.   In my own digital bookshelving (mostly on Booklikes these days, only adding books I've reviewed on Goodreads now) I have an shelf/tag for distopia that often is paired with sci-fi or with fantasy, and sometimes with neither.   I think I tend for more overlap with Science Fiction rather than Fantasy due to the number of books that use the folly of man combined with technology as the vehicle to explore distopian settings (or alternatively, used to explore how we could improve).   When you add in the post-apocalypse setting to distopian often the crisis is triggered by technology.   S. M. Stirling novels of the Change (Dies the Fire, etc) are based on fantasy but are more post-apocalyptic event rather than specifically utopia/distopian. Phillip K. Dick's distopian fiction, or Heinlein's utopian fiction are pretty solidly based in a sci-fi setting.;It strikes me as a smart move. So many people avoid certain genres because they're unfamiliar, or because they have ideas about SF&F being for ""nerds"", or literary fiction being ""difficult"". I am definitely guilty of doing that at times. Yet the best moments are when you pick up a book you'd never have gone for but for mis-shelving and discover that it's marvellous in its own right.;I forgot.   With regard to The Hunger Games...In my experience, humans injure each other easily enough, both accidentally and on purpose.   It's the killing that takes the extra practice.   BUT, it is much, much easier to ""sin by omission,"" to stand by and do nothing (or be unaware and oblivious) while another person dies.   In The Hunger Games, remember that most of Katniss' ""kills"" are indirect.   SPOILERs: - She mentions that there was one set of games where the children simply sat around and starved to death.   It was considered the most boring games ever, so the arena-masters added ""features"" to prevent it from happening again.- She drops the tracker jacker nest on one crowd of children, and lets them die by wasp sting- She waits on the cornucopia all night, while the muttations slowly kill the last enemy childI'm sure there are other examples./SPOILERSI'll second what the above poster said.   The second & third book do get into the psychological aftermath of surviving.;Thanks, both of you - this is interesting stuff!  Kim - I have a couple of anthropologist friends who've taught me that assumptions about graves and grave goods, ""hunter gatherer societies"", and so on in the public consciousness are way behind what's going on in academia. One of them told me a brilliant story one of her lecturers told her about 20 years ago about visiting a remote tribe in an African nation. She discovered that ideas about their social structure and the emphasis on hunting were totally wrong and asked why. It turned out that the people realised that the white men who'd come to see them in years past had firm views about how they lived, and weren't interested in anything that didn't fit that pattern, so they gave up and just ""told them what they wanted to hear"", in part just to get rid of them. Oops...Faith - good to see that the books have more depth than I've seen from the PR.  At some point, I'm going to get round to reading the books. My list of books to read just never seems to get any shorter!;Yes, I always start by writing out my complete thoughts, and then use editing to put it within the word limit (adding detail or removing hedge-words).;We aren't writing fiction.   We are attempting to convey clear thoughts.As my business prof explained, fuzzy writing is a reflection of fuzzy thinking.I've had assignments that ranged from 50 words to 10 pages.   Don't forget that while some of us are students with a lot of time, others of us are balancing a full-time job, a family, and graduate-level graded coursework.   270-320 words allows us to convey a complete thought, without requiring an all-nighter writing the paper.   It also respects the time of the paper reviewers.;Dobrie dyen!   Ochen priyatno!;YES, the Dark is Rising movie was *awful*, and I had SUCH high hopes - this has been an awesome century for good fantasy movies, now that the technology has caught up with our imaginations.I've read most of Joseph Campbell's works, and I know whoever adapted The Dark is Rising was trying to fit it into some of the mythic journey, but they went overboard on formula and failed miserably.   Susan Cooper's book touches on the mythic quite well enough as it is.;For the AI Class, several of us were in touch via Twitter and Facebook as well, for general ideas.   Is there a Twitter account for this class?   Or a Facebook Group?;The video said that our papers are submitted anonymously.   The computer already has our name, and links it to the material submitted.   I would omit a header.;I don't think there are any rules against it.Similar to other here, I think before the paper is due (noon EST Tuesday) I would only post general thoughts, and wait to post your paper until after it's been submitted.;I agree with previous posters that the library would be my first choice.   I've read ""The Left Hand of Darkeness"" from libraries at least twice before, and I don't think I own a copy yet.My libraries include a small ""Friends of the Library"" bookstore for cheap but not free, if you are lucky you might come across them there.   Or another used bookstore.Any chance that you have a birthday or anniversary this summer?   Would a friend or family member be willing to give you a copy for the occasion?   I know it's hard to ask.;It's hard to say.I was initially trained in a very formal (5-paragraph) essay format, in which one would NEVER use the word ""I"" in an essay about literatureThen I changed schools, and suddenly everyone wanted to know what I thought and what I felt.   I held on to the habit, though, and even got in trouble as an undergrad because my report on my internship never said what ""I"" did :)As an M.A. student, though, the ""I think"" and ""I feel"" was allowed, even (or perhaps especially) when writing about literature.But also review the video on writing expectations.   ""I think"" and ""I feel"" don't lend themselves readily to a 270-320 word thesis on the book.   In a short paragraph like that, I would consider the phrases to be extraneous and unnecessary.   Of course this thesis tells what you think.;You can miss two essays and still get a certificate of completion.I've been in at least one and sometimes two grad school classes since January, and this weekend was finishing my last major assignment.   Between that, work, family, etc, I've been just slightly short on sleep for about 6 months now.   This is a light concluding week, and next week will be my one week off before my next summer class starts.   I decided to start catching up on sleep Monday instead of doing my Grimm essay.I plan to catch up and do an essay for Week 2, and will try to keep up after that.   (I may post a late Grimm essay in the discussion forum.)I do agree that Dracula is not a book I am eager to read.   My husband tried to watch the Bram Stroker's Dracula movie with me once in college, I made him turn it off in about 10 minutes.   That's very unusual for me.   While I don't like horror and rarely choose to watch it, with a group I've usually been able to stick it out.;I have placed my one completed MOOC on my resume.I agree with the ""do your best and forget the rest.""

I think it's important to discuss these issues as adults, and even in secondary schools with adolescents.   I do have concerns with younger children.My son has inherited several of his grandfather's books, that we currently keep out of reach.   Some of them include archaic stories of things that I do not believe are okay.   Under my first premise (read for discussion of the issues around adolescence or later), I'm currently storing them out of reach & out of sight of my 5-yr-old.And yet, and yet.   Is it privilege that lets me wait, and not talk to him about these things yet?;And I read The Left Hand of Darkness *twice* in high school, and don't even remember the gender shifts.   It will be interesting to read it again now.;I came into the course knowing that Grimm's Household Tales were not pretty stories for children.  Even the Disney adaptations contain cruelty, if not on this scale.  I grew up knowing the story of Little Red Riding Hood (as Red Cap is known where I am), I knew that the wolf ate people up. To the original poster, I would advise not continuing the course.  If you think that the Grimm tales are bad, then Dracula, Poe, and The Invisible Man are much worse.  I am not a horror fan at all.  I've done all right with Poe in written form, but most video adaptations take it a step further than I'm comfortable with.  Still, horror is part of our imagination. You ask how we handle it.  I handle Grimm through separation - ""It's just a story, it's not real.""  I agree with you that many of the punishments are horrible.  The sad part is, many of the things that happened, while fictionalized, have their roots in true human experiences.  Fairy Tales are rarely sweetness and light. ;I didn't ""get"" Alice as a child.   I enjoyed the poem Jabberwocky, and also memorized at least portions of it, but that's about it.I have seen Alice imagery in multiple places, from the Disney adaptation to the Muppet Show, to even Star Trek.   Many scientists have adopted the plays on words from Alice's adventures to describe the things they find, so that is another avenue that makes the stories worth reading for me.;Was anybody else reminded of the Angry Birds' Bad Piggies when they saw the ""green pigs"" translation?Or am I just weird like that?;"

However, I also don't think it would have to correspond exactly with MLA or other recognized citation style.;I learned it as a fun little nonsense poem.   Some of the words from the poem (gymbal comes to mind) have been adopted in the scientific community.But if you want a word-by-word explanation Alice repeats the poem towards the end of the book, and each word is explained to her.   I believe there's another thread on this forum that uses the translated words.;Keep in mind that most ""Modern Art"" was created in the early to middle 20th century.   Pablo Picasso lived from 1881 to 1973.   Salvador Dali lived from 1904 to 1989.   Many of their most famous works were created in the 1930's.   We're already past the ""Postmodern"" era of art.In addition to the choice to go with copyright-free material, I think the works that were selected still have a bearing on the world we live in today.   If you recall the lectures on Grimm, and how the Grimm brothers were working to bring about this idea of Germany as a nation... something that England and France had already done by the era of Joan of Arc (as learned from a Great Lectures course, ""Medieval Heroines in History and Legend"").   The rise of Germany as a nation was pivotal to 20th century history, with not one but two World Wars.I'm old enough to remember the 1980s and some of the later Nazi trials, and in particular the concept that ""Just following orders"" is not a valid justification for performing horrible acts of cruelty.   The two World Wars carried into the Cold War that lasted until about 1990.   Even 23 years later, the world is still adjusting to the realities of a post-Cold War era, the fall of the Soviet Union as a superpower... and the waking of China from isolationism to resume activity in world affairs.So much happens between the 17th century and today that are unprecedented in human history.;Oxana,Here is the link to the Great Courses webpage for that lecture series:  http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=2937I was able to check it out from my local library, as a set of audio recordings on CD (it may be as many as 48 CDs long).   I played the recordings in my car on my commutes.   If you are interested in women in history and/or the medieval era, then I think it's worth your time to listen to them.   I definitely enjoyed the lectures and learned a great deal.   However, for a 19-year-old, I am not certain it is worth the $$$ to buy your own copy.As the link indicates, the lectures discuss Eloise and Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, Eleanor of Aquitane, Queen of England and France, and Joan of Arc.   I remember the comparison that in Eleanor's time, there wasn't a concept of France or England as distinct nations.   But that had changed by Joan's time.;I discussed this with some friends of mine who enjoyed B-rated horror movies.   The wife was Jewish, and explained that the concept of vampires is inherently Christian.If I understand her perspective properly, kosher meat is drained from blood.   Also, if I understand correctly, hallal meat is handled in a similar manner.   Both practices are an indication that drinking blood is anathema to both Jewish and Muslim beliefs.However, as has already been discussed here, the Catholic mystery of communion proclaims that the bread and wine are transformed into the Body & Blood of Christ. This is true for both the Byzantine rites (Greek & Russian Orthodox) and Roman Catholics.   Protestant beliefs on the subject vary widely.I do agree with David Grigg that the tools against vampires (crucifixes, the host) do seem to be equally effective for non-Christians.   There's an amusing moment in Buffy the Vampire Slayer when they have to uninvite a vampire from Willow Rosenberg's house, by nailing crosses beside the door.   Willow expresses concern over what her Jewish parents would think.The literature on vampires varies widely with regard to their powers and limitations.   In the case of Buffy, they had the vampires turn to dust in order to limit the number of bodies lying around during filming.;"

Both discuss terrorism and also betrayal.I'll do my best below to describe the two characters well enough to distinguish who they are without spoiling major plot points.   In one movie, the events are within the first 20 minutes.   In the other movie, the motivating background is not revealed until very late in the movie.Both Iron Man 3 and ST:ID include at least two traitor figures.   The two I am comparing betray their responsibilities in order to protect their daughters.   In ST:ID, the traitor is given a very slight sympathetic treatment.   His daughter was actually dying of some disease, his opportunity is to cure her completely, and just before he fulfills his end of the deal, he sends off a message telling who, what, and why.   The traitor of Iron Man 3 has none of these sympathetic elements.   I can't help comparing and contrasting these two characters with a recent public figure.I also found the Iron Man 3 use of the ""Mandarin"" character to be a wry political commentary.;The wolf that Dracula borrows in order to break the glass and remove the garlic from Lucy's window.;I did wonder, when I saw the professor's e-mail, about the children captivated by ""the bloofer lady"".   It is true that they are not named... There seems to be a class (and possibly age) issue, since I gathered that the children (both the kidnapped and killed child in Transylvania and the injured children in London) were low-class peasants.   They were never named because they didn't ""count"" as people.I found it interesting that I saw a reference to a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.   For the curious, the children's rights and anti-child abuse movement arose out of the Animal protection movement, in the 19th century.   From what I have read so far, that seems to be after the Dracula era.;At least one legend has Athena sprung full-grown from Jupiter's head, and often displayed ""man-brain"";These are good thoughts, and add to my comments in the ""no children in Dracula.""The children shown so far (I'm still on the hunt on the continent) have been working class at best.    I saw implications that the children bitten by ""miss bloofey"" were likely beggars, or just barely better.   And so they don't ""count"" as people, or characters.The wolf, Berserker, gets named and his kidnapping described, but these children are kept anonymous, unknown, barely-there figures.;I also am not participating in the writing portion *this* cycle.

I'm still going to attempt to read along with the class.   I am not a slow reader, but life is interfering so that I am finishing the books a little late.  I also would not have tackled this reading list if it were not for this course.   Horror stories are not my cup of tea, I've read too many that ended on terrifying notes rather than hopeful.   So I was surprised to find myself really getting into Dracula late in the book, curious about what happened. And yet I think I shouldn't have been surprised, as there are very few books I've read for school assignments that I did not come to appreciate.I am enjoying the discussion forums and conversing about the books.

Hopefully I can get some more feedback from all of you...The plot in Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There is  framed around a mostly correctly played game of chess, as noted by  Carroll himself in the Preface of the 1896 edition, that is used as a  road map for Alice to follow.   Alice first sees her chess board to be  played as she and the Red Queen reach the top of the hill.   Alice, while  looking out at the countryside declares,    It   s marked out just like a  large chessboard.    (p.30) I would posit that the game of chess played  out and the trials and tribulations Alice encounters along the way are a  barely veiled metaphor for life   s very real road blocks and adventures. Alice begins the game as a pawn, or a child, with very little power  and only one direction to start to travel.   As Alice journeys forward,  towards ultimately being castled and becoming a Queen, or an adult, we  see her meeting challenges along the way as she encounters and interacts  with the other chess pieces.   She becomes stronger in voicing her own  opinions and ideas as she travels along, growing up in the process.   As  an example, near the end of her journey, while the Queens (Red and White  together) are trying in a sense to put Alice down she exerts her  growing independence.       Can you do sums?    Alice said, turning suddenly  on the White Queen, for she didn   t like being found fault with so much.     (p. 119) As she completes her journey, one can   t help but draw comparisons  with Harry Potter   s journey, as he too must cross a chessboard while  playing Wizard   s Chess on his way towards finding the Sorcerer   s Stone.    There are many other works of literature which draw on the use of this  chess metaphor, as can be seen in the article    Literature and chess   ,  but few bring the joy we share with Alice as she grows along the way.

The  content, overall, is fine, you use quotes well, yet some sentences are  not structurally strong.peer 2      The test does show knowledge of the works in addition to consult  another source regarding the games that they are made, the argumentation  is good, right persuasive way, and helps us to better analyze aspects  that take place in Alice's Adventurespeer 3      The essay has a strong argument and supports it adequately. Bringing in  another example of literature that supports the statement is good too.peer 4      From the perspective of not having read the stories, I felt compelled  to read the stories after reading your insight. Very good way of  explaining the plots and detailing the journey of Alice. The essay  reminded me of a summary of a movie.

I'm guessing you have physics as a focus in your real life as well :-).After reading your essay, the first thing I was thinking was, ""of course the Cheshire cat and Schroedinger's cat have parallels. Why didn't I think of that!) It is nice to see some new ideas and themes, as I said somewhere else, because most of us ended up writing variations on the same or similar themes in one way or another.I think you could have done without including the concept of Quantum indeterminacy at all, as you had no space to comment on it except in including it, and your thesis was well enough supported with your discussion of chaos theory and Schroedinger.There are a few small grammatical errors - there [are] underlying causal models -- for example,Overall, a great job!;Thank you Florencia!I see what you mean about the Harry Potter comparison. I used it as an example of the way the chessboard metaphor is used in other literature. I probably should have either given two examples or none, and just relied on the reference to the article about all the other literature. I think I probably would have done better to do something on your rules idea and less on the metaphor idea.I forgot about the Italics option. In my actual exercise, book titles were underlined correctly with the article titles in quotation marks, but the underlining didn't transfer when i copied it to this forum. I'll make sure to correct that when we do this for book number 3.The red queen explains   to Alice the way to become a queen as a parent would instruct a child. Children grow and challenge their authority figures as Alice starts to stand on her own and challenge the Queens.dIt is sooooo hard to decide what to keep and what to leave out   in these short essays. I would much rather write longer pieces but I guess that would put too much pressure on us all as reviewers, reading 5 longer papers.   Maybe one of these times I will be lucky enough to have you as one of my five scoring reviewers :-);Hi Samantha --Thank you for taking the time to review my essay.I really like that you focused in on one specific item -- the mock turtle -- and through exploration of this specific section managed to define an important aspect of the entire book.   So many of us have discussed the books as a whole or broad themes. Your insights are universal, within the context of Alice's ""universe"".As to form issues I won't get picky. You know what the mistakes are and I know they are almost all typing and/or copying   issues from paper to computer, I like your use of parentheticals, but that is probably because I tend to like to use them as well. For the direct quotes you should identify the location in the book by listing the page number within the body of the text. Overall, your essay was very well constructed and very interesting with well supported arguments. I think I would have probably given you a 2 for form and a 3 for content.Keep up the good work.;Hi Florencia -- Glad to see you here.I'm sure we will all benefit from your insight and generosity again.I agree with one of your other reviewers that you could have rephrased your thesis so as to avoid ""my thesis is"". Maybe something like, ""While our normal standards of space and time don't apply in Alice's lands, they are still not arbitrary.""   This sentence -- Both are cases of enlargement, and Alice learns on the way -- is unclear to me. I think maybe if you put the two separate thoughts into two different sentences you could explain it better. I also feel that your concluding sentence could be more clearly stated. I really like   your essay.   Your thesis is strong and you do a good job of supporting it throughout with appropriate examples and quotations. I think perhaps it might have been stronger to focus on one book or the other, as it is very ambitious to try to cover this topic fully for both books giver the word count.   I'm not sure though. Great job overall!;"

I'll start it off. Your comments and criticism are most welcome. Stoker uses the mechanism of the epistolary novel not only to give us  the benefits of seeing the unfolding events through the eyes of each of  the protagonists, but also to show us the irony of the fact that this  set of characters seem to be aware of the benefits of pooling their  thoughts and histories themselves, while they are within the story. They  are aware of the benefits of both having and learning from this record,  thus being able to use this knowledge as they progress. This can be viewed as the Victorian version of 20/20 hindsight as  Harker relates near the end, in his 3 October journal entry.      We have  been blind somewhat. Blind after the manner of men, since we can look  back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able  to see what we might have seen! Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is  it not?    (p. 450) It seems from the very beginning that the characters are aware that  their story is being written both for them to use and for us to read, as  Harker first starts keeping his diary on page 3. As the most prodigious  of the diarists Stoker presents Jonathon and Mina as the arbiters of  truth, not only in their writings, but especially Mina as custodian of  their written records as, also in his 3 October entry, Jonathon tells  her that    she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers  or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was to keep the  record.    (p. 418) Jonathon acknowledges, still on the 3rd, that he    must not  stop to think. All big and little must go down.   Perhaps at the end,  the little things teach us most.    (p. 413) And earlier that their    work  is to be a    sealed book,    (p.363) which we are lucky enough to share  with them through Stocker   s machinations.;Thank you Kasey --All six! of my reviewers were very critical this time and I got my lowest score yet. That's part of why I wanted to get additional opinions on it. I'm going to read your essay now. Stand by for comments. :-);Hi Florencia --Glad to see you here. What a small Coursera world. Aren't there 20,000 or so people taking this course? I'll have to look and see if I can figure out which one you are. I'm guessing 1 of the only 2 that wrote anything constructive and not just critical. Now, If I've figured this out right either 2 or 3   of my reviewers gave me 1's for content. It's a little frustrating. I know it's not my best effort but I was expecting the middle of the road 4 overall. I know what 1 essays look like because I've had to give a few. This is not a 1 essay! Unfortunately there is nothing to be done about it except move on and hope the rest go better. I'm behind on my reading so I don't know how my Frankenstein essay will come out. I actually haven't started reading it yet so I had better get to that. It looks like Celine gave you some good feedback so if you don't mind too much I don't think I'll get to yours till tomorrow.;I think you were my peer 6. Did you wish I had expanded on the concept of Jonathan and Mina as the arbiters of truth?;Hi Florencia -- Yes - you were my peer 1.   I continue to respect you for the quality of your reviews, but even more for your generosity in continuing to review so many essays in order to help your peers. You devote many, many hours to us and I want to make sure that you know how much you are appreciated.;Kasey --How picky do you want me to be?? At first reading I really liked your essay a lot. Then I did what I usually do and printed out a copy to mark things on. (I still write to paper and then transpose to the computer, I can't write to keyboard except for forum type entries.) I can either give you a few general comments or I can get really specific. Which would you like me to do?;Kasey --I'm going to be tougher than I would be if you were one of my 5.   That way you can have the most possible information for next time....As I said, on first reading I really liked your essay a lot. It was an interesting subject and you write very well. I always do a word count check as I get ready to print out a copy and found that your essay came in at 347 words. After all the discussion on these forums about word limits this could have been an issue with some of your reviewers. After printing it out to really study it, in order to be able to give you the most feedback that I could, this is what I found. You have a very strong well worded thesis and you back it up well with appropriate examples and quotations. I would add ""the"" to make it ""the old ways of superstition"" to keep the same format as ""the new modern"". Your concluding sentence is just sort of hanging out there and you should probably integrate it into the body of your last paragraph. You could probably easily have pared the word count down to the limit by eliminating duplications and rewording some things. The second sentence of your thesis statement is, ""Through the character of Van Helsing, we see Stoker's claim that science alone is not enough, but that both science and superstition are needed for success.""   The very next sentence says, ""Van Helsing uses science to prolong life and aid the characters in finding Dracula, but this science is not enough.""   The last sentence of the second paragraph. ""...science...alone cannot do the job.""   First sentence third paragraph, ""he knows that they need something more powerful than just science."" Last sentence third paragrah, ""...science...will not be enough..."" Last paragraph   uses ""in the end"" twice, and there is one misspelling of Dracula. Last sentence third paragraph: I always offset ""in fact"" with commas on each end. Back to the first paragraph you have, ""Through the character of, Van Helsing,"" then, ""Van Helsing uses, ""Van Helsing represents,"" and ""Van Helsing uses."" By the end of the essay, and considering your concluding statement, the reader could be wondering if your essay is not more about Van Helsing than the ""science vs. superstition"" thesis, so you should probably find a quote or example of your thesis that doesn't use Van Helsing and/or reword your conclusion.That's all I have. Let me know what you think.Laurie;Just to add to the confusion --   I'm working off of   ""A New Edition""   1823   With one ""Preface.;My ""grades"" are also getting lower.

I hope you're out there Florencia - you know when I wrote this, so what do you think....The very human need for companionship in general and close companionship specifically is a major theme throughout Frankenstein.    Whether it be the fellowship of man in broad terms or a close paired  relationship, either with friend or spouse, nearly all the characters  are either seeking its bonds or running from them through self-imposed  isolation. Frankenstein exemplifies all of the aspects of the full spectrum of  human relationships throughout the book even, ironically, the two  extremes simultaneously.   The monster, while always seeking acceptance  and companionship can also, in essence, be seen as a metaphor for  mankind   s perpetual search for fellowship. His search, therefore, is chimeric, as a thing that is hoped or  wished for but is in fact illusory or impossible to achieve.   At the  same time the monster himself is a chimera in other ways.   He is a  creature with parts taken from many others, thereby containing a mixture  of genetically different tissues; the very thing that is the basis of  so much hatred and discord in volatile political climates, as people  desire the society of their peers. In this sense, with the monster viewed as the    everyman   , the book,  beyond its straightforward depiction of the relationships between its  characters, can be seen as a treatise on the nature of the overall  political climate of the time, and man   s overall tendency to  marginalize, stereotype or shun those seeking autonomy and acceptance. At the end of the book Frankenstein dies while experiencing the  duality of states he has exemplified throughout, with his new friendship  with Walton while perpetually isolated from the fellowship of man in  general. The monster, however, remains    forever ardent and craving;  [still desiring] love and fellowship,    (Vol II, p.275) without the  possibility of obtaining any of    the various relationships which bind  one human being to another in mutual bonds.    (Vol II, p.14);Florencia -- How strange that you should actually get two of my essays to score! There must have already been huge attrition in this class. I wonder how many of the initial students are still here with us. We started with something like 27,000 or something, didn't we?Thank you so much for your review. You were my peer 3.   It was insightful and helpful as always. And especially thank you for saying it was one of the best Frankenstein essays you had read. That means a lot. Thank you for the 3, but I must have gotten 1s again from some of my peers because I ended up with 2s (total score 4). Would you believe one of them marked me down because there was space at the top of the essay, then said I spelled ""its"" wrong and that it should be ""it's"". Hard to deal with people ""correcting"" your already correct usage... (sigh) And then I get comments like this, ""maybe add some examples and do a better job at having a more persuasive argument and essay.""I think Jeremy did an excellent job at reviewing your essay. Do you still want more feedback?;Hi Florencia --Overall I think peer 2 and Jeremy did an excellent job and between the two of them covered many of the points I would have, so just a few here.Your writing in this essay has some of the same weaknesses that mine tends to have. I sometimes rely too heavily on the use of parentheticals and quotation marks to offset specific words or concepts and/or asides when using a more conversational tone as you do here. For me, the overall essay did not seem to flow easily and I had to go back and reread carefully to keep track of which usage you were using where. Having said that it may just be the nature of the beast in discussing forms of word usage. At the beginning you do one of the big things I used to do all the time and get corrected for. Writing in the passive tense is discouraged in academic writing. As such, ""This is said by the monster,"" should probably read, ""The monster says."" In the last sentence of the second paragraph ""common core"" might better be ""common root"" and there is a rare, for you, usage error.   ""This can be thought as,"" should be, ""this can be thought of as.""I agree with Jeremy that, ""Up to the first half,"" should be changed, I just disagree on how. I would use either,""During the first half,"" or, ""Throughout the first half."" Clearly, you know that, ""he's is not merry,"" needs to be he's or he is.Hope this helps.

This is achieved through different literary mechanisms. There is the use of metafiction, mise en abyme, and self reference. Metafiction, according to Patricia Waugh is:    fictional writing which self-consciously and systematically draws attention to its status as an artifact in order to pose questions about the relationship between fiction and reality    (2). The first example of metafiction that we encounter is right at the beginning of the story:    and what is the use of a book without pictures of conversation?    (8). This first allusion about the act of literary creation within a literary creation can be seen as a hint to the reader of what Carroll will deliver in this book: plenty of conversation and pictures. In terms of the mise en abyme, it could be argued that Alice has fallen asleep at the beginning of the story:    for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid    (0) and that, within her dreams; she has created a whole new world which is a reflection of her own. As any mirror image, this one shows backward or altered images of the    real    world and we can find, within this self-reflected universe, several more.   Finally, Alice shows an explicit example of self reference when she says:    When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I   ll write one- but I am grown up now.    (50) These three literary devices serve Carroll to explore the limits and scope of the fictional world and to reflect on the role of the author, the reader and literature.

Well done! peer 3     The writer's thesis as to the construction of Lewis Carroll's works is very precise, and examines the books from their literary structure. I think that the argument is very persuasive, if somewhat too scholarly. That really is not a criticism, but a personal reflection.

But the sacredness of the number 3 or the literaty tool of repetition must be much older than the bible and does not stem from this.  ;I think that it might also have the very simple function of making the story slightly longer. If the story was about a person that went into the world, met an obstacle, conquered it and returned home, there would not be much entertainment. By having three (or more) obstacles, or sometimes three sons/daughters where the first two fail the first obstacle and the third makes it by overcoming three obstacles, we have a story that is of a useful length; short enough to be told at bedtime or over a jug of beer, but not so long as to bore the audience or make the storyteller get confused (indeed, it is also easier to remember a story when you have three similar points along the storyline).  This is of course not the only or entire explanation, but it might be part of why there are three obstacles in many fairy tales.;A major difference between Andersen's stories and Grimm's is the degree of details. As Andersen's stories are his own - inspired by the tradition of fairy tales of course, but created by his fantasy - you will find that they in much greater detail describes the looks and feels of the items in the stories. He takes great care to arrange the setting, whereas the fairy tales can take place almost anywhere in the world.Take as an example the introduction to Aschenputtel:""There was once a rich man whose wife lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter to come near her bed, and said,  ""Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you.""  And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother's grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, the man took to himself another wife.""And the introduction to The Little Match Girl:""It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark. Evening came on, the last evening of the year. In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets. Of course when she had left her house she'd had slippers on, but what good had they been? They were very big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother. The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast. One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own. And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand. No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.""The details are so much more important in Andersen's stories, as they are his exact words and probably written and re-written many times until *he* was content, while the details - save from a few magic phrases or adjectives that are important for the story later on - are not that important in fairy tales and have probably been changed a million times over the years, with all the different storytellers, until the brothers Grimm wrote them down - and they don't seem to have been all to careful with the wording, as long as the point was made.  One other issue here - for I need to get back to my essay and not spend my Monday evening writing about Andersen - is the unimportant details, Andersen brings into the story. E.g. ""One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own."" - this comment from the boy is in no way important, we have already learned that the slippers were big, event way too big, and also that they had been her mother's. But Andersen wants us to really feel with this girl, so he overloads us with details about the mocking. Fairy tales rarely contain anything that is not important to the storyline.;Sorry, forgot to add:  Aschenputtel is quoted from the Lucy Crane edition, The Little Match Girl quotation is Hersholt's translation, which is a very good translation (http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheLittleMatchGirl_e.html).;I grew up with these fairy tales and it was nice to meet some of the characters again - Mother Hulda, oh I had completely forgotten about her, and I recalled the images of my childhood fairy tale books. Note to self: Must find these books at my mother's house and have my own kids read them :)As for the two-dimensional characters, I think that it is very important in folk tales and fairy tales to have basic characters with basic stereotypical features - greedy, proud, wise, dumb, beautiful - as it makes it so easy to transfer the stories from one part of the world to another. These stories are quite universal and have been around ""forever"", which might have been difficult if the characters were complex. Also, it makes it easier for the storyteller to tell almost the same story each time as he does not have to dwell on or remember details about the characters, places, etc. - just the basic outline of the story. Something happened to someone, he did this, this happened, he did that, then this happened and he won. It also makes the stories perfect to tell over supper, before putting the kids to bed, between songs around the fire in the evening etc.;It is always an hour after the submission deadline, just as we get the results an hour after the peer review submission deadline - so in a few minutes :);On the Home screen to the right there is an Upcoming Deadlines section with the Assignment link.

I think what threw me off was the description ""the specific stories are"", yet I believe this means that there are many more Grimm's tales than are in that one translation, so by using this translation we are doing selected readings. For the rest of the syllabus Prof. Rabkin explicitly states what stories we are to read.   For example:""In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg.

I also think your comment about the structural function of this asking/compliance will help alleviate some of the frustration and downright annoyance I've felt while reading many of these stories. I don't have a lot of background in literature study, which I'm sure interferes with my ability to approach these tales from a deeper understanding, so I'm often left with the feeling that I'm both missing the ""real"" meaning and that I just plain didn't enjoy the stories/characters. So many of the less familiar tales especially seem disjointed, although when I was looking back to find an example to use here, I found I was less irritated than on my initial readings (""Death of Hen"", ""The Mouse, Bird, and Sausage"", and ""Mr. Korbes"") so maybe I just need repeated readings and a new frame of reference like you've offered here.

In a world where anything is possible, maybe we shouldn't have been surprised :);I noticed that a lot of the royal characters in these tales don't have names. They are just referred to a King, Queen, Prince, or Princess. Maybe this is a way of creating the concept of ""common royalty"" (which seems like an oxymoron), so that readers could relate to the story in that the characters could be rulers of any country, including their country. I could really be going out on a limb with that idea, but I still think there's something to be said about the nameless characters, royal and otherwise.;Good point!;Whose twins are Rapunzel's?

I did notice that Rapunzel is referred to as his ""wife,"" but with the vagueness of the King's son wandering for ""several"" years, I wasn't sure if the children could be his.

If more letters follow then there are two words, if a space follows then there is only one.;Having a word limit is a useful discipline, having a low word count requires clarity of thought and expression. It is far more difficult (for me) to write 300 focused and pertinent words than 3,000 words of meandering stream of consciousness.I've not come across any written work in higher education here in the UK that did not have a word limit.;I don't know what constitutes a note but, for me, an essay (in this context) is the argumentative support of a thesis. It must therefore state, explicitly or implicitly, the thesis, present one or more arguments to support this and have a conclusion to draw together the case.

An 'essay' could, in principle, be contained in a single sentence, while thousands of words could be expended without satisfying the essentials.;I found this very difficult because, although I've written a lot over the years (from repeatedly unpublished short stories via political articles ghost written for others through to many technical publications) I've no experience of literary criticism or analysis.

A well-argued essay can and should be awarded a 1 for form while gaining a 2 or even 3 for content if it's presentation doesn't meet the expectations.

Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable[my emphasis];To say 'a lot of Old English... seems funny(and sometimes not even understandable)' is something of an understatement. Little of Old English is comprehensible to modern English speakers. Take a look at this sample:F _der ure  _u  _e eart on heofonumSi  _in nama gehalgodThose are the first two lines of the Lords Prayer in Old English. It is slightly more comprehensible when spoken but even so is a long way from the language we now know. Shakespeare is generally seen as standing on the threshold between Middle English and Modern English (or more properly, between Early Modern and Modern). We can read Shakespeare today and understand the language despite a few changes in vocabulary. Writing a scant hundred years earlier is far less comprehensible and in the period of Old English (some five hundred or more years before Shakespeare's time) we are back to just the occasional wisps of meaning breaking through to our modern ears.;What do you feel is stopping you from reflecting on your work and the comments you receive?I reflect on every piece of work I undertaken whether it is a piece of writing, a lesson taught or an engineering project I have completed. I would have assumed this was the case for everyone until I became a teacher when I found to my chagrin that my students had no interest in feedback beyond the grade awarded.;As has been said, the system should not accept submissions more than 10% over the word limit. If I had received such long essays I would have marked 1 on form and only considered the first 350 words for content. The most generous of my former seats of education would automatically apply a 10% penalty, the harshest, disallow the entire work.;I'm afraid I'm taking those figures as overall guidance rather than hard and fast rules in each assessment. To apply strict proportionality in a set of five assessments simply leads to inaccurate assessment. It would be quite possible to draw a set of five essays all of which fully meet the requirements. Would you suggest I should pick one at random and award a 1 in order to meet the quota? Conversely, I could receive five pieces of writing none of which were close to meeting the standards. Should I mark four of them as 2 regardless of quality?;I found similar. Two of the five had no thesis. One had an unclear/multiple thesis. Of the 'no thesis' essays, one was simply a list of quotations from various stories with no obvious link between them and no explanation. Twelve paragraphs, only one of which contained a full sentence. The rest consisted of sentence fragments and quotes. The sentences and fragments also contained frequent spelling and grammatical errors to the point of not being able to determine the writer's intention. I don't see what I could do but grade that at 1 for both form and content.;Kerryn, you have hit on exactly the same interpretation as I had. I read the story as contrasting the pure and innocent Alice with the corrupted Victorian society. A rigid hierarchy where justice is determined arbitrarily from above (Knave's trial) where petty officials exercise power through the confusion of language and procedure (the Dodo) but where there is an idealisation of the child as an embodiment of innocence.;OP, while it may be that you gave more attention to your essay than you did this posting, I would point out that just in the few sentences above I noted 12 errors of spelling, grammar or usage. It is very difficult to spot errors in one's own work, that is why I always have important work proof read before submission.While individual peer assessments may well be inaccurate (in my experience they vary widely), the overall assessment is usually   accurate. Overall, I have found that peer assessors on most courses tend to be too generous in their marking with many choosing to overlook errors.I can't comment on the the assessments of previous work but would suggest that the focus might have been on other areas. For example, some courses (and teachers) overlook errors of grammar or usage in favour of content. It is also the case that, if your teachers were not themselves native English speakers, marking and grading may not always be perfect. I was surprised when meeting my wife's Professor of English to find her spoken language almost unintelligible and that her written English combined extremely dated vocabulary with frequent grammatical errors. This was a lady who had been teaching English at university level for over thirty years.Forgive me if my assumption that English is not your first language is incorrect.;By the way, where on earth do they have 'contests' of grammar and punctuation outside of primary (elementary) school?;I wouldn't normally pick over a forum posting as nobody expects them to be grammatically or stylistically perfect but if you want me to mark the errors or awkward usage then here we go:I am finding it difficult to having  [having]  my essay being [- not required -]  judged by students.   One person said my grammar and punctuation were amiss. However, I have written for a very long time and know I had no errors in regards [regard]  to theses  [these]  aspects of my essay. The reviews of my essay was [were]  unnecessarily harsh and widely, overall,  [odd usage, not sure how to correct]  incorrect. I have written college level essays through [for?]  five different colleges,  [',' not required]  for credits [credit].I have had my writing style evaluated by hundreds of instructors, none have had any concerns about my grammar or punctuation. In fact, I've won a few 'contests' rewarding these very aspects of writing. I am just perplexed on how I am so harshly judged by people who perhaps are not proficient in writing grade  [grading?]  and judge my work in   [to be of]  such a low caliber.I am not saying my essay was perfect, it was not. I know where I made mistakes. I also do not mean to sound harsh, disrespectful, or conceited, but I'm finding these evaluations simply harsh, unfair and even incorrect in some instances [too many adjectives and repetition for good style].  If someone had many mistakes, I graded them a 'one', sure. However, I graded anyone who made just a couple of mistakes, a 'two'. While I was given a 'one' for even fewer mistakes. [incomplete - better include in previous sentence].No individual error is 'critical' (I'm not even sure what would make a grammatical error 'critical') but an accumulation of small errors can be tiring, Something that is less easy to illustrate is that the phrasing and word choice seem a little awkward overall and, for me, the writing does not flow smoothly. As I said at the opening of this post, I would never apply such a detailed critique of a posting unless asked as, in general, they are far more casual and ephemeral than formal academic writing.;Even more worrying is that they highlight errors which do not exist, make suggestions which are not appropriate to the audience and purpose and are generally a poor guide to writing. As I indicated earlier, my first essay was reported as having over a hundred critical errors. Just out of interest, I have now checked my second essay using the site linked early in this thread and I'm excited to report that I have improved to only 17 'critical' errors!;I've had a look at the grammar checker suggested and, to be honest, I would avoid it. I disagree with every one of the 'corrections' suggested on samples of my own writing and samples from professional writers. Apparently words such as accurate or individual  are complicated constructions and to avoided. Moreover, the word lady is reflective of gender bias and should be replaced by woman!The OP will doubtless be happy to know that my essay had over a hundred critical grammatical errors. Fortunately, my peers either didn't agree or were far kinder than his. The problem, or one of the problems, with this sort of program is that it cannot take account of the audience and purpose of a document. It appears to be making recommendations suitable for a Junior High School audience who cannot manage to follow sentences with more than one clause or words with more than two syllables.Look to your peers. if one reviewer makes comments which seem unfair or inaccurate, ignore them. If all your reviewers make similar comments, think how you can address them.;It's sort of an ego/participation meterNot a terribly good one though. I wasn't even aware of the 'top poster' link until you highlighted it!;I'd certainly agree that the correct use of paragraphs is   important. The details of format such as indenting as specific to styles, such as MLA, and can't be properly implemented with the limited tools available when pasting (or typing driectly) into the submission box. MLA requires, for example, that all essays start with a header detailing the student's name, professor, college etc. Should I penalise students for omitting it? That style (as do most academic writing styles) also requires that text be double spaced and have a header, neither of which can be achieved here.Clarity and consistency are more important to me than the number of spaces used to indent (and MLA deprecate the use of spaces anyway for indents anyway, half inch tabs should be set). I'm looking for paragraphs to correctly focus on a single idea and to link to both the preceding and following paragraphs. I'm generally unhappy to see single sentence paragraphs and would wonder whether a three line sentence could not usefully be divided in the interests of clarity.;I've yet to see anything which I would classify as deserving a three, certainly my own writing was not of an exceptional standard, objectively. I do have concerns about setting quotas. It is wholly possible that all five papers could be below standard or exceptional although it is more likely that all will meet the requirements and be graded as twos. Working to quotas when marking only five papers normalises over far too small a sample. Even when marking hundreds of papers (as might be the case in a or college school setting) one still needs to be cautious about not deviating from objective standards where the work is for externally accredited courses. Those who do so are far more likely to have their marking challenged through moderation.In the early stages of a course one is far more likely to see work which is clearly far below the expected standards. As the course progresses many of the lowest achievers will drop out (my experience on other courses suggests that those who have a very limited grasp of English are less likely to continue submitting assignments, for example) pushing up the average standard. In all likelihood some   90% or more of those registering will fail to fully complete the course (in line with the normal retention rates for MOOCs). Human nature being what it is, those finding it most difficult or least rewarding are the most likely to drop out.Given the above, I look forward to seeing exceptional work produced both by filtering and practice. I'm not sure how easy it would be, in practice, to score a three for form. How does one more than fully meet the requirement in such a short piece? I can see much more easily how exceptional standards could be achieved in content. I also wonder how many will be able to separate the two elements and mark a well-argued but poorly presented paper as one for form but three for content.;I think there are two parallel and sometimes apparently contradictory aspects. While the writer obviously has some insight into his or her intentions and motivations, even the most self-aware is subject to unconscious influences. When the Grimm Brothers complied their stories did they think ""Hmm, we'd better make sure the heroine is beautiful but reliant on men because that reflects our patriarchal view of society""? I think it is unlikely (even if one accepts that interpretation). Writers are products of their society and reflect the attitudes and understandings even where they explicitly reject them.What is important is to consider the context of the writing and here the writer may have a critical input. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings  was often interpreted as an allegory for the rise of Nazism in Europe but this could be definitively debunked by the author on the grounds that the sections mentioned were written many years before the events they were supposed to reflect.Meaning, my psychologist wife tells me, is constructed by the reader within their own context and doesn't have any objective reality. I'm not sure, as a scientist and engineer, that I'm ready to accept the strict constructionist approach but it does have merit for literary analysis. What the writer intended to say is not always what the writer actually expresses. I've certainly found myself in discussions saying 'that wasn't what I meant' then looking again at what I had said or written and recognising different aspects to those I had intended to express.;I think that first person narrative is harder to do well. As has been alluded to earlier, it can narrow the perspective but this can be to the benefit of the story is gradual disclosure and understanding is desired. The advantage of first person narrative is that it allows far more seamless integration of the narrator's thoughts and feelings. As Laura says, I rarely notice the voice if the work is well written. Where it is poorly written every word can jar the nerves, regardless of person.;Luis, I rally think you are going to struggle if you are not confident in reading and writing English. machine translations are weak at best, and often wildly inaccurate. it may be worthwhile highlighting what it say in the Course Syllabus under Recommended Background:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students. Therefore, for all participants, reading comfortably in English at the undergraduate college level is desirable.Even with reliable translations, any direct quotes you take from the text are going to look 'odd' if they have twice been through translation.;The article was interesting but not entirely convincing in regard to Dodgson. I had the distinct impression that the author had started from the conclusion and worked backwards to find evidence to justify it. It is true that drug use was far more casual in the nineteenth century than is the case even now but it was almost exclusively opium (which was available cheaply and easily after the Opium Wars with China). Opium was in wide use in all classes of society both by smoking (in the notorious opium dens) and through the widespread consumption of laudanum, a tincture (solution) of opium in alcohol. Sold as a patent medicine it was bought for it's narcotic qualities (being even cheaper than gin) to the extent that pharmacists would stock up ready for the weekend rush when workers were paid.Initially seen as a working class vice it quickly spread to all sectors of society - the poet Coleridge was famously addicted and wrote under the influence. Probably the most famous work associated with this form of addiction came from Thomas De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium Eater where he recounted his experiences as a laudanum addict.  So far as I can work it out (difficult as he measures his consumption in 'drops') he was getting through about a pint a day - a substantial hit of alcohol before getting to the opium!Dodgson was a churchman and academic. Although he moved in society there is nothing I've seen to suggest that he was a drug user beyond the re-interpretations of his writings a century after the fact, in the light of the hallucinogenic drug culture of the 1960s.  ;Amanita Muscaria was then well known as fly agaric and used as a primitive insecticide. It was known to be poisonous and its distinctive appearance must surely have deterred accidental consumption. I don't recall the mushroom in Alice being described in terms matching this species.;I had the dubious pleasure of reading De Quincey about twenty years ago and have hardly recovered from the effort now. Not the easiest read.;The Apollo programme and its promotion by politicians was largely a response to the perception that the Soviet military-industrial complex had stolen a lead. It is difficult now to imagine the impact that Sputnik had both on American prestige and their sense of security. If the Soviets could place a satellite (however small and functionless) in orbit then they could clearly reach deep into the American heartlands with their weapons.The American people felt let down by their government and by 'science' - which was supposed to have been their shield (as was later the case with Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative aka 'Star Wars').     We shall go to the Moon  _    was partly political showmanship, given that the President would have been out of office before it came to fruition or failure, and partly a way to justify increased spending on science which had clear military application. Although Kennedy brought focus and set a target for   completion, the programme had already been planned in outline under the previous Eisenhower administration.     Let us not forget how quickly interest waned in the Apollo programme which was cut short before it's planned completion - only 11 of the planned 14 missions being completed (cutting the landings from 10 to 6 including the aborted Apollo 13 mission). I can remember watching the television broadcasts of the first landing but can also remember clearly how subsequent missions dropped off the news schedules, ""in further news,another Apollo mission landed today on the moon. Now, getting back to the Vietnam war reports..."";My essay was not very inspired. It is sound enough and deserves 2s. If I could figure out what a 3 for form should look like then I'd do it but the Alice stories, however much I'd like to like them, just don't really interest me. Dodgson fascinates me as a person but his writings, although clever, just leave me cold.;I've reviewed my share of peers and a few more and was a little disappointed to find the standards were, if not lower, certainly no higher than last time.One essay which was just a whisker off 3s for both form and content.Two which had no issues with form but absolutely no content - no thesis or conclusion and just a random jumble of observations.One which appears to have been through a machine translation, which didn't work. Even the book's title was mistranslated. Putting the language issues aside the form was flawed - nine paragraphs in 300 words is just too many. As it stands, over half the sentences are fragments (some having no verb, for example) and it really is impossible to determine the writer's meaning in a good third of the essay.Content is no better (so far as I can tell, given the garbled translation) with no thesis, common theme or conclusion. Sadly, 1s for both form and content.The rest of the essays were fairly straightforward 2s for both form and content. No more exciting than my own efforts but clearly written and argued.Once again the Works Cited appears to have defeated most writers. Web sites continue to appear in Works Cited when there is absolutely no reference to them in the text. Whether this is because the quotes were cut in editing or because the writers misunderstand the section as some sort of bibliography is unclear.;HiThe point of my posting which, I can now see, was not clearly expressed, was to get a general view on the trend in essays. Each of us sees only a minuscule sample so individually our observations have no statistical validity. I had posted on another thread that I anticipated a distinct upward trend, based on my experience on previous courses and on the usually high attrition rate. I hadn't seen this among the essays I had read and was interested in how others saw it.I've no axe to grind, particularly in regard to those who do not have English as their first language. My wife, who has English as her third language, would certainly have something to say to me if I were to express such bias. On the other hand, I can't agree with the oft repeated request that we should ignore the quality of presentation because not all of us have the same background either academically or linguistically. A course must have objective standards and these seemed to be clearly stated in the rubric and in the expectations of the course as being equivalent to those expected of a college (ie university) undergraduate.It is important to distinguish between form and content and it should be perfectly possible to score well in one regard while performing badly in the other (within the constraint that the language must be clear enough to understand). The majority of work I have reviewed is solidly in the '2' ratings, as I hope mine is. This is in line with the professor's expectations. I have slightly more 1s than I'd expect on average but that will almost certainly improve over the course.I always try to give specific and detailed advice to the students whose work I review and would hope that others would do the same. It is disappointing when simple 'mechanical' errors mar an otherwise good paper and failing to highlight these does nobody any favours.;"

I've had 6 on one occasion (on another course) and I know another student reported getting eight! Conversely, again on another course, some students received only one evaluation.;You should not be surprised to find little or no change in your gradings. As the instructions are written, the majority of work will always rate a 2. If you write a piece with a few structural or spelling mistakes most assessors would probably award that a 2 (I would anyway). If you then write a piece with no errors but without being exceptional quality (in terms of advanced undergraduate writing) you will still get a 2. I've had 2s on both essays so far and don't really anticipate getting a 3 as I've no background in literary criticism or of this type of writing. Although I hope to improve my writing, in order to improve my grade I would need to move from satisfactory to exceptional and, given that many of our peers are working to a strict 10% quota, that is unlikely to happen.For most students on this course 4 is how they will start and 4 is how they will end.;As a teacher you will know how difficult it is when you first start assessing other's work. Even more difficult is offering suggestions for improvement. While I would assume that most will be able to make a decent attempt at evaluating the quality of work, it is a big challenge to expect useful feedback from people who have never done this before.When I grade work for externally accredited courses my colleagues and I first mark exemplars supplied by the examining body so that we know we are grading to the right standard. We then moderate each others assessment (that is we mark a sample of our own students' work and compare grades) to ensure consistency. Here we are all just jumping in and trying to do the best we can. As an experienced assessor and examiner (albeit in another subject area) I can only guess how hard that must be for those without any previous experience.;People are struggling enough to decide between fails to meet expectations, meets expectations and exceptional so you want to add 'exceptionally bad' to the options? I wouldn't see it as helpful either to those writing or receiving the feedback.;A 5 point scale gives more granularity but, given that this course is peer assessed, is likely to give less consistent results. Why a five point scale rather than a 10 point or why not mark as a percentage? The answer is clearly that readers are not in a position to make such fine distinctions. Most of us, whatever our background, can recognise whether a work that broadly meets the requirement. Asking much more than that is unrealistic (in my opinion).I don't think a separate mark for referencing is necessary on this course as the majority of the work I have read required no references. External references are far less necessary in these short literary criticisms as opposed to longer forms or other subjects. I've used no external references to date.On the other hand, I have seen frequent misuse of 'Works Cited' with web pages being listed to which there were no direct or indirect references in the body of the text. Either citations were lost during editing for length or writers are using 'Works Cited' as a general bibliography. Although I always comment on this, I would only penalise if there were other significant errors.;Dodgson wasn't 'fond' of photography, he was considered one of the leading portrait photographers of his generation,;Lucy was amazingly lucky to survive the transfusions - unless she was blood type AB+ (which is rare - around 3% in the UK) then she had a 50/50 chance of fatal reaction on each transfusion!;Well, now that I have finally written my essay, I suppose I have a few minutes to make some general comments. I had read Dracula a couple of times previously but not for some years. I actually found I enjoyed it more this time although it still is far from being at the top of my 'favourites' list. I think the style works well, giving a patina of realism, without getting in the way of the story. It also allows for multiple characters to give personal views which is difficult in any other form. The verbatim transcription of accent and dialect just didn't work for me. Not only were some parts almost indecipherable, it is not credible that a diarist would write in this way - particularly if, as in Mina's case, the journal is written in shorthand.I found the first half of the book the most effective. Once the 'action' started it seemed less interesting and the ending was particularly disappointing, almost as if Stoker had lost interest by that point;Certainly British schools and universities are very weak in teaching academic writing - or to be more accurate, they simply don't teach it at all (and I say that as a teacher).Given the diverse backgrounds of students it might have been helpful to outline a basic essay structure that would support those with less experience or confidence. The course is, however, advertised as being broadly equivalent to advanced undergraduate level so maybe the expectation is that we should already know the basics.My suggestion, repeated a few times over the last couple of weeks, is to keep it simple:Introduction and thesis - what you want me to believeSupporting evidence - why I should believe youMore evidenceConclusion - link it all together and remind me what it is you are arguingIn general, I'd expect each step to be one paragraph as each presents a separate idea. Given the word count this means paragraphs will be short. Try to avoid one sentence paragraphs as they annoy some reviewers and it can make the reading rather choppy. Keep sentences relatively short to match the very focused structure of this short-form essay.I should warn that one of my reviewers commented that he or she found my format 'formulaic' so there is no guarantee that any particular style or format will satisfy everyone. My observation would be that we should always remember the audience and so simpler styles are appropriate here.;Our weather being what it is in Britain, I'd certainly recommend keeping your pants on - and preferably a good stout pair of trousers too!  (For the avoidance of doubt that is a deliberate play on the different usage of 'pants' between the US and UK);Noel, it makes perfect sense. I've said on another thread that I really don't know what would characterise a '3' for form, although I hope that I'll recognise it when (if) I see it. The comment was actually quite fair, my essay was formulaic. I simply took the standard layout and plugged in the information I wanted to convey. There were no errors in spelling or grammar but there was also nothing 'special' about it. It was competent and workmanlike, interesting but unexciting which probably reflects my background in technical writing.Having said all that, it is still a useful start for the many writers who are clearly losing out on these essentially mechanical skills rather than through lack of understanding of the subject.;I agree entirely. The suggestion I have made in more than one evaluation is to keep it simple. If you are a post-doctoral research fellow then by all means use your full range of technical vocabulary, while keeping in mind your audience. For the rest of us, stick to language with which you are comfortable and confident. While the tone should be relatively formal, it is more important to be clear and correct than 'academic'. These are very short essays and there isn't room for rhetorical flourishes or meandering diversions. Tell me what you think (state the thesis). Tell me why you believe that (supporting evidence). Convince me you're right (conclusion).;It doesn't matter, the figures would come out the same either way. What you are doing is adding together 14 scores and taking the average.You could average each assignment then 'average the averages', or calculate the average of form and content separately and then average those two average - it wouldn't make any difference at all.Green average works out each assignment separately, red works out the elements separately. Trust me, I've tried different combinations and it really does always come out the same!;averaging exactly 2 on  Form  and  ContentIn each of six assignments the student needs to average 2 for the two separate elements of Form and Content and submit a seventh essay (which can average no less than 1) in order to reach the 'Pass' threshold.Note that if the scoring were as Joseph suggests then the next part of the quotation  one submission averaging exactly 1  would be impossible to achieve as the lowest possible mark for an essay would be 2 (1 in each of the two categories). It would also be impossible for any student to fail so long as they submitted something (or anything) for each of seven assignments as they would be guaranteed to score at least an average of 2 overall.;but do the math as I have done in my original thread:  6 submissions with 2, 1 with a 1, is 13 divided by 7,  This is were your error comes in, you have overlooked that each score is stated to be an average.Once again, from the page you quote:averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay                            [my emphasis]And, as I noted, it would be impossible to get a score of 1 if the basis were the total of the two marks. It is not possible to leave a score of zero - 1, 2 or 3 are the only options. The Work Expectations page describes the scheme thus:grading scale: 1 (inadequate), 2 (successful), and 3 (outstanding)You would suggest that achieving a grade of inadequate in every part of every essay should be classed as a 'Pass'. That does not appear to be in line with the statement on the Course Syllabus page that:the course will be conducted at the level expected of advanced undergraduate students;If I score 2 for Form and 2 for Content, the average for that assignment  is:(2 + 2) / 2 = 2If I score 1 for Form and 1 for Content my average  for that assignment  is:(1 + 1) / 2 = 1Now I have scored averages of 2 for 6 assignments and an average of 1 for the seventh. My average overall is:(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 +2 + 1) / 7 = 1.85;A piece of work cannot be graded as 0 for one part only of Form or Content. Only 1, 2 or 3 exist as options. If you do not enter a grade for one part then the grading will not be accepted by the system.I really cannot accept that any course would take 'Inadequate' in every part as equating to a 'pass', regardless of philosophy. I await with interest any feedback from the course team but I strongly suspect that you will be disappointed.;I agree. Joseph doesn't - his interpretation requires only 13 points in total from seven assignments.Drat! I promised i wasn't going to get involved in this discussion again.;Traditionally, academic writing was always in the third person. Even if you were referring to yourself, it was done obliquely, ""The researcher observed..."". This is still pretty much the case in the natural sciences but humanities (so far as I can see - it's not my area of specialism) seem to have taken a more flexible approach in recent decades.Where I would have concerns in an essay is if 'I' merely prefaces an unsupported personal opinion. Generally, the advice is to write positively so instead of ""I think the changes in size are a metaphor for puberty"" it might be better to phrase it ""Changes in size are a metaphor for puberty because x, y & z"". If you don't show confidence in your own thesis why should a reader accept it?;I wouldn't disagree. I am, personally, solidly in the third person camp, so to speak. I moderated my opinion, as expressed above in response to feedback on this course and elsewhere that indicated, certainly in the US, the use of the first person was increasingly common in humanities. I'm not familiar with academic writing in this area, I am an engineer and teacher of IT by training and background, so when instructors, TAs and many fellow students all tell me I am mistaken I am inclined to reflect that when I give an answer. I use the third person and frequently a passive voice when writing formally. My wife does likewise in her writings in the field of psychology. All the peer-reviewed journals which I read follow the same style. This very topic was the subject of discussions recently with staff on my wife's Masters course. The advice there was that it would never be wrong to use the third person and that was the preferred style. The first person could be used (in psychology) when recounting personal experiences, for example in a qualitative study based on the participant observer model where the use of the third person might be unclear (e.g. in distinguishing the researcher's actions from those she is observing) or unnecessarily convoluted.;I can't speak to doctoral theses as I'm not in a position where I would be reading them. Most of the research I read in peer-reviewed science journals is still solidly in the third party camp. As recently as last week I read an article which used exactly the formulation quoted earlier, ""In the course of the interview, the researcher observed..."". The researcher was the writer. This is slightly unusual (which is why it stuck in my mind) as a more typical approach would have been to ignore the observer entirely ""During the course of the interview it was observed that..."" using the passive voice which is, along with the third person, still characteristic of scientific writing.I did not claim that the use of these styles was universal, even in the natural sciences. I did observe that the use of the first person was becoming more common.;I think we are probably both saying much the same things, just from slightly different angles. Your comment that it ""drives me batty to see that tired old third person and/or passive approach"" certainly suggests that the style is not unfamiliar to you.  A lot of my reading recently has been from my wife's psychology journals (she is just finishing her Masters and I am half-way through the Intro to Psychology here on Coursera) and it sometimes seems as if they are trying even harder to appear detached and impersonal than those in the traditional sciences.;We have here perhaps 1,000 students.A little conservative. I'd guess that the number participating is still around 20-30,000 at this point in a course.;I'm not sure that the use of the crucifix or communion wafer are actually 'religious' per se. My reading is that they are merely used as amulets to ward off danger. That is to say they are seen not as symbols of faith but as items having inherent power (so a non-believer would enjoy the same protection as a believer).I don't think I expressed that distinction terribly well.  ;I try to use the third section for 'holistic' comments about the essay. Sometimes, even after taking into account the comments on form and content there are overall remarks needed, either in praise or observation. For example, an essay might have one or two easily corrected grammatical errors and a fair content which just needed more focus. Those would be commented in the form and content sections. I might feel though that the overall tone of the piece was 'uncomfortable'; too casual or too strained. I might want to congratulate the writer on a very easy and enjoyable piece even if, by dint of poor content, it scored badly.My comments in the form and content sections are very focused and specific. The final section will have far more general comments. Although I think that I have left comments every time so far in the third section, I can certainly imagine that I might not do so for a future essay if I had nothing worthwhile to say.;Have you experienced sarcasm?;Victor is a rather unpleasant and shallow character while the 'monster' is more sympathetic, eloquent and intelligent (in the book) than his creator. This is presumably why the misidentification of the creature as 'Frankenstein' became widespread so quickly.;Normally (ie on every other course I've taken here that used peer assessment), if you didn't complete the peer assessment then you did not receive a grade at all and that is implied by the Professor's statement  Each time you submit an essay and return your evaluations of your fellows    essays in a timely way, you will be taken as having made one full submission.  The general notes say  If you have not finished your assigned evaluation tasks by this time [ie the deadline], your own assignment may not be evaluated and you may receive a grade penalty.  But this is the standard text on every course and it is up to the course team how they apply this. There is nothing to indicate that any penalty has been implemented for this course.;I have checked through the terms and, as I expected, there is nothing about ownership of assignments so normal intellectual property rights apply (that is to say, the creator holds the copyright). So, in principle, if the monkeys get lucky, any insights are their's and subsequent use should cite them.It is worth noting that for anything posted publicly on the forums or course Wiki you ""grant Coursera and the Participating Institutions a fully transferable, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use, distribute, sublicense, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such User Content.

Children were idealised as symbols of purity and the depiction of nude children was a common artistic theme and even on appeared on   Christmas cards.;The general rule on Coursera says ""If you have not finished your assigned evaluation tasks... your own assignment may not be evaluated and you may receive a grade penalty"" but it is up to the individual courses to decide how they implement this. Although the Professor says that a complete assignment consists of both submission and evaluation, from reports last time there appears to be no penalty.;I've no problems with any argument being advanced so long as some support is shown in the text. On the other hand, my experience to date both here and on other courses, is that unpopular views are less likely to be well-rated regardless of merit.;If an essay fails to meet the expectations then it should be graded as a 1 - 'Inadequate'. The course is Pass/Fail so I'm not clear why you should want a lower grade.You cannot substitute essays in the way that you suggest; you are required to complete the assigned evaluations. In practice, it doesn't seem that any penalty is set up for those who fail to complete their evaluations (despite the generic warning that your work may not be evaluated or you may be penalised). Should you decide not to grade an essay then your 'non-mark' will simply be ignored in calculating the overall score. I don't know what the situation would be if your peers all take the same line and there were no marks available, my suspicion is that a 'Pass' grade would be awarded - but that is only a guess, I've never seen any statement or come across this actually happening.;I can't get my head around pronouncing Mina as the prof. does. I had read it as 'Meena' matching the pronunciation of the name of which it was a familiar or diminutive variant. I've never actually come across anyone using this form so I've no idea how others pronounce it. The only 'Wilhelmina' I know is a great-aunt who was always known as 'Ina' pronounced 'Eye-na' just to ruin my theory! Incidentally, thinking about name choices. In the case of my great aunt, her father had wanted to name a son William but had eight daughters. On his wife's last pregnancy he swore that, come what may, the child would be christened as William. Fortunately, some sense was restored when his ninth daughter was born although it only stretched as far as taking a feminine variant. She was born (in Scotland) shortly after the turn of the twentieth century so not too long after Dracula was written but even then the name was seen as dated and cumbersome - hence its never being used in full.;"

Does someone not like my great aunt?;Professor Rabkin pronounces the name as Min-na to rhyme with 'mini' - as he himself highlights specifically when identifying it as suggesting small.Although the pronunciation caught my attention, the observation would be valid anyway as she is the only character to be routinely referred to by a diminutive - nobody is calling Jonathan 'Johnny' for example.By the way, how is the name pronounced in the film versions?;I agree overall; marks for content and form should be independent (so long as the work is readable - I had one which made no sense at all and I guess had been through a machine translation). There is no reason to leave rude comments but some are maybe just not too confident in expressing their suggestions.I don't support the idea that lower standards should be applied to those who do not have English as their first language. This is a literary course presented in English. If I were studying a course in another language I would expect to be judged on my ability to express myself correctly in that language. It seems rather patronising to suggest that non-native English speakers should have a more generous grading (and how would you know anyway - some of my own High School students produce far worse written English than many of the non-native speakers here). My wife has English as her third language but has strongly expressed her opposition to special pleading on that basis. In her studies here in the UK, both under- and post-graduate, the only concession was to be allowed the use of a bilingual dictionary during exams.;I'll just bring together a few points that I've made in different posts. Professor Rabkin has taken the decision to make the 'grading' as simple as possible - Pass (meets the requirements) = 2, Fail (Doesn't meet the requirements) = 1. To be honest, it might have been best to leave it at that point but, presumably to give an incentive to excellence, he also includes an additional Outstanding (significantly exceeds expectations) = 3.As those of us who are teachers should be aware, assessment is difficult. Giving useful feedback is even more challenging, especially where the assessor is inexperienced in assessing or the subject. My experience in this and a number of other courses suggests that peer evaluations will be close to the grade that an expert assessor might have awarded but that feedback is far more variable. My interpretation is that people can quickly learn to recognise the features which make for a Pass or Fail but are less able to justify this or to make suggestions for improvement.Are comments unnecessarily negative? Possibly, but I think this reflects the inexperience of the assessors rather than any malice. In trying to find suggestions to make readers often focus on the areas in which they feel most confident, so you may see detailed discussion of spelling or a particular grammatical point, for example. Comments on content often reflect the reader's own interpretations or a strict adherence to a particular model of essay writing.Going back to the original post, a score of 4 or 4.5 is fine. Professor Rabkin guided us that most work should be rated as 2. I've received 4's for every assignment and am perfectly happy with that (it also matches my self-assessment). I've awarded no 6s to date and won't be worried if I go through the course without doing so. I've seen perfectly competent writing and some interesting ideas but nothing that strikes that spark of 'outstanding'. To a degree this is all rather subjective, which I why I suggested it might have been better to leave it at a straight Pass/Fail but my impression is that most students, trying to be fair, err on the generous side of grading.;Unfortunately, it wouldn't be possible to assess the same peers each time.The drop out rate is such that most of those remaining at the end of the course would have nobody left to assess. Typical completion figures are in the region of 5-10%.;If you've achieved 4 or more on the first three assignments then you are, effectively, half way to a pass (given that you can submit 'anything' for your seventh and get a 2). You need to have scores under 4 for five or more of the essays before you need to really start worrying.;One reason you might be seeing a drop in your assessments is that the expectations of your peers is increasing both because they have more experience in this course and because many of the 'weaker' students will have dropped out by this point (typical figures would suggest that around 80% of starters will have gone by now). Even if your work improves, it may be that the expectations are increasing faster. I'm not saying this is right or wrong but this is my best guess.;I'm not quite sure how you reach that interpretation from what I said. To clarify, from my experience as a teacher, the expectations of those who have less expertise in an area is generally lower than those with a greater level of expertise, even when guided as to the objective standards expected. If I know little about literature and have no experience of academic writing, I am likely to judge the quality of a piece of work more highly than if the same piece were evaluated by someone with a strong background in literary criticism and a familiarity with the conventions of academia. I'm not claiming this to be a universal rule but it didn't seem controversial to me to me at the time of writing and nor does to seem so now.Most of us are here for self-improvement and pleasure. If we find we are struggling to keep up or to access the material effectively then it would seem natural to drop a course and find something more suitable or appealing. Given that 90-95% of all registered participants fail to complete most MOOCs, it seems that most people share that view. I have certainly dropped a number of courses because they were not as I expected or were just too difficult, given my current learning. In the latter cases I then had to decide whether I was interested enough to do more preparation and try again on the next offering or simply to leave it and move on.Nowhere did I suggest that one should 'make the competition drop out', nor would it make sense to do so. Firstly, we are not marked competitively - nobody knows or cares whether my final grade places me in first or ten thousandth place. Secondly, if my assertion is correct, that weaker students will grade more highly, it would surely make sense to encourage their continued participation in order to garner higher scores.  Going back to the original question of why grades might appear to fall,   Professor Rabkin said in the introductory video (00.03 How to Write for this Course): Notice that the hypothetical  student, the intelligent, attentive,  fellow student in the class with every  unit will know more than was known before.  Will be more sophisticated than before. So  this assignment. Enrich the reading of the  intelligent, attentive fellow student in  the course actually is more and more  demanding as we go from unit to unit.;  I do know also, that most people read at the 8th grade level  Francine, with your training I need hardly remind you, ""audience and purpose""...;I could have given someone a lower score not knowing that this week they have vastly improved their understanding of the workWhich would have been correct as we are marking whether a piece meets the requirements, not whether the writer has improved. Within the bounds of subjective judgements, the marking is absolute, not relative.;Forum participants can vote a posting up or down by clicking on the arrows below the post or comment. In principle, by highlighting exceptionally informative or interesting posts they can be seen more easily by other students. Conversely, posts which give inaccurate information or are needlessly argumentative can be 'down-voted'.I said 'in principle' because, in practice, the points don't seem to have much effect. Unlike some other courses, the default sort order for posts seems to be date order rather than 'popularity' (although it's also possible that I've just fiddled with my settings and everyone else is defaulting to popularity!). Moreover, the voting often seems more to reflect the reader's agreement (or disagreement) with the post than being an objective indication of quality; so a well-written and argued posting putting forward an unpopular position is unlikely to gather much support.;Laurie, thanks. I know that you can choose the order but the default here seems to be date order. On some other courses it defaulted to 'Popularity' or ('Top Threads' when viewing a forum). If I change the sort order by clicking the button, this choice is not remembered when I come back or even when I move to another thread. Now that doesn't bother me as I want date order anyway but it does seem to make voting 'pointless', if you'll excuse the pun!;There are, based on the postings I have read, a number of teachers (myself included) on this course and active on the boards. What is easy to forget, when one is experienced in assessing work, is just how difficult it actually is to give useful feedback. I've received feedback which is vague, contradictory and just plain wrong, but I've no doubt that the vast majority are making an honest attempt to do their best.My experience, the comments on forums both on this course and others and the available research all suggest that peer evaluators do pretty well, as a body, in grading. I've seen relatively few complaints on that front beyond a few 'Why aren't I getting 6s yet?'. What is far more difficult, and something that I've not seen any research addressing in detail, is giving individual feedback to explain the grading or to suggest improvements. Even in my own specialist area, IT, I sometimes find myself (metaphorically) scratching my head to give my students feedback on how to move a piece of work from a Pass to a Distinction. In those cases I often have to fall back on a point by point analysis of the mark scheme (i.e. rubric) to identify where they lost points even though I was able to accurately assess the work quite quickly. Here peer evaluators don't have detailed guidance and the grading is a very broad-brushed Fail/Pass/Outstanding. I don't find it surprising that many can give only fragmentary advice or that, given the varied language and cultural backgrounds, the comments can seem curt or even insulting.Peer evaluation and feedback is an imperfect tool but the only realistic option for free courses of this type. Even when you feel that the real root of poor feedback is that the reader simply didn't understand what you were saying, this has value because, as Professor Rabkin highlighted in his introductory videos, we don't write in isolation but rather should always consider audience-and-purpose.As I said in a posting way back at the start of the course, those who can't live with peer assessment have two choices, audit the course without submitting assignments or go to your local college or distance learning provider and pay for a professionally assessed course. By way of example, the Open University here in the UK (where I earned my first degree) will charge   2563 for UK or EU students to take the course  20th century literature: texts and debates  which includes 6 professionally assessed written assignments and individual tutor support (by email or telephone). This is, of course, a far longer course anticipated as taking 15 hours of study per week 30 weeks and equates to 17% of a full Bachelors degree.;The comment in regard to the options for those who can't accept the limitations of peer assessment wasn't particularly aimed at any of the posters here but was for the wider group and harking back, as I indicated, to a discussion in the first week of the course. I included the comment because I had just looked at the Open University site and had been surprised to see how much the fees had increased recently. Rather than being   500 to   1,000 as   I remembered they are now   1,200-  2,5000.I should say that they only way I could afford to take a degree course was to do so on a part-time distance learning basis while working full-time throughout the entire six years that it took to complete. Even now, I certainly couldn't justify spending   2500 to satisfy a casual interest in literature. Although I've been involved in some sort of education or professional development for most of the last twenty years or so, every minute of that was aimed directly at career development... until the arrival of MOOCs. I greatly value the opportunities that are presented to learn the things that interest me rather than advance my career but I think it is important that we recognise the limitations of the format. If we have an unrealistic expectation of our peers' ability to give specific and helpful feedback then we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. I would, of course, encourage everyone to consider how they can improve the feedback they leave and how they can   get the best value out of the feedback they receive - which I think was the point of both the original post and my earlier contribution.. We should remember that most participants in MOOC courses never access the discussion forums (figures suggest that around 10% access the boards at some time with maybe 1% being regular visitors) so whatever encouragement we give here will be reaching mainly those who are already predisposed towards community involvement. In a way we are 'preaching to the converted'. This is also, in part, why every discussion of feedback starts 'I always give great feedback - how come I get   one word comments?', because the people posting here are not typical students. Based on research, the typical MOOC student views some of the videos, does just enough on the assignments to pass and drops out when interest wanes. The typical 'frequent poster' (i.e. a student strongly involved with the community aspects of a course) studies all the videos in detail, follows up additional research, discusses and develops the ideas and strives to achieve 100% in all assignments. They are also far more committed and more likely to complete a course; there is a strong positive correlation between the time spent on the discussion forums and the likelihood of successful completion.Sorry if this post has gone on rather too long and drifted from the original discussion. I'm spending way too much time on the boards as I'm 'home alone' while my wife and son are away visiting relatives overseas.;One of my (many) grammatical failings is the overuse of commas (or, failing that, the use of parenthetical comments). One of my pet hates is the misuse of apostrophes. A perfect post.;Isn't that what the (anonymous) opening post said, albeit in a more light hearted way?;Surely the peer assessment page is quite clear, for each part; 1 is Fail, 2 is Pass and 3 is Outstanding?I think Professor Rabkin's explanation is a little unhelpful, perhaps statistics is not his strong suit or maybe he wasn't familiar with the constraints of the Coursera marking system. Talking of students getting an 'average of 2' on an assignment can lead to some confusion as Coursera doesn't display or calculate the results in that way (in fact, Coursera's whole progress tracking is very weak compared to, say, edX). As we can see, the marks for the two parts are added rather than averaged, so the target then becomes 4 points for a 'Pass' on an individual assignment.To achieve a Pass overall students need to have an average displayed score of 3.6 from the seven best marks which equates to 26 points overall.Ignoring the possibility of 5's or 6's, and for most of us that should be a fair assumption, this means that from the available ten assignments you need to pass six (and submit a seventh, regardless of mark). This would give:((6 x 4) + 2) / 7 = 3.7I have three assignments with 4 on each so far. That means I'm nearly half way to a Pass. Three more 4s plus 2 for the seventh would meet the minimum grade.If you are lucky enough to be getting grades of 5 or 6, or unfortunate enough to have grades below 4   then you'll need to do a little maths to get your total - just add the seven best scores and divide by seven.;Yes, an essay must have a clear thesis. This doesn't have to be explicitly stated ""My thesis is..."" but it should be apparent to the reader and ideally stated in some way in the first paragraph. Overall, I'd say that about half of the essays I have read either didn't have a thesis or has an unclear thesis (for example, one appeared to have three unrelated theses raised in the first paragraph, but no further reference appeared in the rest of the essay to any of them).;"

The Grimm Brothers were mainly linguists, they wrote an enormous handbook of the German language (how the meaning of words changed over time) that is still in use. The folktale collections were just a side project for them - but mediawise they were very advanced. for example they did not really travel that much from place to place to collect these tales, but they put adds in the newspapers and asked people to submit them or to meet them so they could take notes. Many of the tales are also variations of even earlier French tales. All of that happened around the time of the French Revolution - and I think partially these stories and their effort to conserve the German language has to do with the turmoil all around them. They wanted to create a German ""nation"", with one language and a folktale tradition of their own   (which did not really exist back then, there were just many different districts and small states, only loosely connected through a language).;   It's not about ""a"" moral, I think.

I definitely agree that often times you get a different feel for something when it is read allowed but in this case, I don't think you're cheating yourself one way or another. The Grimm brothers collected so many stories and are the reason we still have many of them but they were not written to begin with.I think it's easier to picture the stories being told around a hearth after the sun has set with the noises of the outdoors beyond a family's door if they're heard aloud. I think you can get something incredible from being able to picture and interpret the stories though this context. It will likely be very different from what someone holds on to if they're reading the text and can easily go back to reread a sentence, but it is just as valid.;It probably also makes them more meaningful to the audience. While stories like these were probably told in taverns and at larger town events, a large part of the audience was children. A child often understands and identifies better with another child.

In the tales, these journeys represent the hero's coming of age, and his recruits and items represent the skills developed in his journey towards manhood.While this trope is present in different tales, one key aspect that changes is the degree of awareness the hero has about his development. In  The Queen Bee, the hero is unaware of the troubles he will face, and is only concerned about following his instincts and thrice rejecting to cause suffering to innocent creatures.  The White Snake  presents a similar premise, in which the hero goes a step further; he tries to quench his curiosity by eating the snake, and receives the ability to understand the creatures that suffer. After helping the creatures, he becomes aware that he shall be rewarded.The Knapsack, the Sack and the Horn, present a hero in a later stage of development; he is aware that he needs a set of special skills to overcome his brothers. Through his journey not only does he collect items but learns to use them to the point where he can defend himself when one of his treasures is used against him. The hero's development reaches its maximum in  Six Soldiers of Fortune, where the protagonist is fully aware of the components he needs to amass in over to overcome his final challenge.""Now, I am a made man and it is time to go home again and see how my brothers are faring""[1]. The increase in awareness is a sign of growth; and being aware of his own development, the hero discovers what skills are worth learning and mastering.Here are the comments for FORM (grade: 2)peer 1      The sentences are correct, the words are properly used and the arguments are clear.

In the first story, Alice is quick to judge the inhabitants of Wonderland and call them on their ""nonsense""; whereas in the second, Alice is more receptive to the idea of Looking-Glass Logic. In Wonderland, Alice is confused by the citizens' behavior because she compares them to her ""real world"", while in LGLang she is more understanding due to comparing their actions to a ""mirror"" paradigm instead.In Wonderland, the Mad Hatter explains that Time works different for him than for Alice, yet ""[his] remark seemed to have no meaning in it, despite being clearly English"", so she dismisses the subject. Contrastingly, in LGLand she shows more openness once she is explained that cakes should be handed around first and cut afterwards, ""[it] sounded nonsense, but Alice obediently got up, and carried the dish around"". This openness is due to her being aware that looking-glass things, such as books, work differently from normal ones.In her first encounter with the Queen of Hearts, Alice immediately chastises her for wanting to hand out a sentence before a trial was   conducted. Oppositely, in her encounter with the White Queen, Alice is aware that the former is living ""backwards"" and is willing to let her explain her logic regarding the same issue. As it has been discussed in psychology, behaviors that are considered irrational when compared to a traditional model, could be considered perfectly rational when compared to an alternative paradigm [1]; this could explain why Alice is more forgiving in LGLand.Works cited:Craig R.

For those of you who haven't seen it, there's great news: NT Live will be providing the recording to theaters again starting October 31st. (Yes, Hallowe'en!)Danny Boyle directed the play and made the brilliant casting decision to have two strong actors rotate the two lead roles. This decision ended up with an Olivier Award shared by Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller. If your local NT Live theater cooperates, you should have the chance to see both versions: one with BC as the Creature and JLM as Victor Frankenstein, and the other with the roles reversed.Venues for the encore screenings have not yet been announced, so bookmark this page and keep checking it:http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/16546-frankenstein And to answer your next question, no, the play is not available on DVD. :-( The NT folks have been asked about that many times, but they have always said that they did not obtain the necessary clearances for a DVD release.

I suggest that you trim your essay a bit, paste it in again, and then see whether Coursera accepts it.FYI, I ran a test to identify the word-count differences between MS Word and Coursera, and the difference is exactly explained if Coursera is counting contractions as two words. So if you have any contractions in your essay (I had a few just from the text I quoted from ""Alice""), they're probably putting you over 320 words in Coursera's view. Trim your essay down to about 310 MS Word words and see if that works.;Alan--I, too, and using Word for Mac and haven't had any problems with extraneous characters being added when I paste my essays into Coursera's web-based forms.

For example, in the case of ""Frankenstein,"" these reviewers might have wanted to see citations from essays about the hubris of science, or the effects of cold parents on their children, or some other analysis of the story. ;Dolor sit amet!:-)Are you getting low grades, or the comments are annoying, or...??;300,000?? Good heavens, what course was that?;The only Hawthorne stories required for the course are the ones you listed. Don't forget the required Poe readings, too!;Beautiful! Thank you for the pointer, Vivian.There's a slideshow of the garden (and also stock photos and information of the individual plants) on the NYBG website:http://www.nybg.org/wildmedicine/index.html;Olga, I don't know what rubricating is, but it sounds like you're having trouble with the formatting. If it's something easy like line breaks, just add them manually after you paste in your essay. If it's something more complicated, maybe you could try a different text editor to generate the text.I notice that your apostrophes in your message above are the same as opening single quotes instead of closing single quotes, so if you pasted that message in from a text editor, that editor is definitely having compatibility problems with Coursera's software. Or maybe your web browser is making changes to the text on its way in. Either way, I suggest you experiment with different software.;Hi, Olga. ""Rubricating"" may be exactly the right word; I'm not familiar with a lot of academic terminology. :-)I use Word myself and have no trouble copying and pasting. But I've read comments from other people who do have trouble. So maybe you should try a different web browser? Also, do you use the Preview option after you've pasted in your text? That should show you exactly how it will look to reviewers.;Olga, I completely understand your reading the assigned texts in your native language. However, when it comes time to write your essays, you do need to back up your thesis with details from the book, so those need to be in English. Once you've read the material in your own language (Russian?), you know the book and should be able to quickly find the sections you need for your essay in the English versions.;Dorothy, where does it say that we have to provide a counterargument??? All of my essays have only supported my thesis.;Interesting. I have enough trouble fitting a couple pieces of evidence for my argument into 320 words, much less adding a counterargument! So I think I'll stick with the simpler form. :-);Anonymous 1, I have encountered many essays that appear to be from non-native English speakers. However, all the ones I've gotten have had generally good English, so I've given them ""2"" for form and mentioned that the person's English is very good for someone who appears not to be a native speaker. If it were really bad, I guess I'd have to give a 1, but fortunately that hasn't happened het.Dominick, do you think that assignment was unintelligible because the person really didn't have good ideas, or because they were struggling to express their ideas in English? I know it can be hard to tell, but when it's the latter, I give them a good grade. As for being one block of text, folks should be using the Preview function to make sure that their text has kept its formatting when pasted into Coursera's web forms.;Okay, then yeah, that would have to get a 1 on Form and maybe also on Content. Too bad.;Byurakn, it sounds to me as though your grading was appropriate. The essay was supposed to be about at least one of the specified stories; if they didn't do that, they failed the assignment.;Anonymous 1, there is a tiny little link called ""flag"" at the bottom right of the essay.

Fantasy tales in general are extremely rigid when it comes to social structures playing a part in what trials and tribulations a hero (or heroine) faces.  Another point. Its not just luck. Anyone noticed that heroes of low birth have their virtues, skills and values taught to them, while the 'nobler' ones seem to already have a predisposition for them?  And whenever we see that our hero happens to be a very fast learner, (I'm looking at you, Paolini) or has exceptionally strong values and character, surprise! He had noble blood all along, and now it makes perfect sense.  There are exceptions of course, but thats the general trend. I do realise I strayed from your point a little, but this tendency seems to crop up everywhere, not just in the Grimms. It seems our ancestors were very taken with genetics.  Possible causes according to me: 1. During the times the stories came up, Kings and nobles were seen as having a 'divine' right to rule, and were seen as 'superior' in terms of blood. A boy with amazing luck/virtue would be more believable if he were of noble blood. 2. Tales would be passed on to the nobles, who would obviously want to be seen as the good guys.

Hope we all learn well together.;Also the idea of storing or concealing the pot of fat in the church and thinking nobody would steal it from there. I think it talks about the pious and sacredness of a holy place and also talks about the conscience..  ;Or can we put it this way..

They could be pretend to be close to serve the situation, but can never be friends..:);This tale speaks a lot about the faith and the need of people, who hold lead positions having faithful people. In this tale the loyalty shown by John to his king was remarkable because he gave up his life for that. And the foresight of king about John's loyalty speaks about ""experience of a person sharpens his ability of judging people"". And the young price can be taken for those who take decisions just by instincts and not a thorough thought process. The raven's warnings to the help received before going to do something impossible. Why raven..? May be because they tend to travel all sought of places and have a facility of watching everything that happens from above. Young King's anger on John shows his love and protection for his wife above anything in this world. But when he sacrifices his children for John, we can infer that he is now a matured leader who could sacrifice his own children for the sake of his subjects. And he putting his queen for test about the children, I think talks about his conscience. When the queen turns up saying the same thing he is relieved. And they lived happily ever after. So it speaks about leadership, faith, loyalty, and family. This is my understanding.. Thoughts please..   ;Cutting the heads of children I think could not have been obvious. I feel, the children being the allegory of the most loving and desirable thing of one's life and cutting their heads is an allegory of sacrificing that most desirable thing . And when it comes to leadership, the leader should be able to sacrifice anything for his followers whatever it is. And to scare people from doing evil and give a picture about tough situations of life, I think the writer could have used such horrible example.. This my thought.. Please share yours.;Or may be they could have predicted the most horrible things that are going to happen in the future.( As we are seeing these days). We came across a little boy killing his fellow students and many such incidents. So i presume they could be predictions of horrible things that going to happen and good thing is that they also spoke about the lesson people are going to learn after being evil. My thought...;Generally when it comes to rain, it is considered for merry and a sign of happiness and is always awaited. But here in this tale, Rain is implied for grief. If rain is to be compared to weeping what else in this world could be a greater grief. Expressing the highest degree of misery and grief. In love with this expression. Please share your thoughts..;Thank you for the response. I totally agree with your point of winter being sad and gloomy. Coming to my point of thought, Yes, farmers are the once who welcome rain. But the reason for that is ""If it rains they are going to have proper farming and in turn produce food grains"". Production of food grains is merry to everyone.

The test to tell humans from replicants, the strange glow in the eyes of the replicants, the way Pris paints her eyes, the glasses of Tyrrell, the way he dies at the hands of Roy, the asian eye manufacturer and so on.It reminded of what Prof. Rabkin said about the symbolism of eyes, as pathways to our souls and so forth. I think it' perhaps the sci-fi work in which this symbolism is most evident and now I wonder if other works follow this same trend. And I also wonder what each particular eye reference means in the book/movie.;That's true.

Why they wanted Deckard to know he was a replicant?

Watch for repetitive use of ""The"" as a sentence starter, and try to move away from to-be verbs (is/was/are) in favor of stronger, more specific verbs, like ""contains"", ""represents"", ""interweaves"", etc. Some sentences are worded in a way that the meaning is unclear, such as ""A group introduces anonymity."" and ""This idea is present in all religions of the book."" I think I understand what you mean, but I'm not certain. peer 3     A well written and structured essay. I like the fact that you have a closing paragraph and would have liked to see more of an opening one, perhaps the sentences regarding the symbolism with the ants and the bees could have been moved to a new paragraph and that first sentence could have been followed with another introductory sentence, because it's currently a somewhat cold open, we jump right in to a list of symbolic elements without much explanation. This is also apparent in the third paragraph in which you've simply mentioned the main lesson of the story but there isn't much explanation regarding it, everything is presented in a very sudden manner.

I would suggest picking one theme and dedicating a full essay to it rather than try to cover everything that stood out to you.  peer 3     I'll be honest with you, reviewing this particular essay has been very hard for me. On the one hand, I love the observations that you've made, it's obvious you've deeply analyzed the story, and yet on the other hand I feel like I am being bombarded with on the surface observations and not a lot of explanation and analysis. I have a feeling this is due to the word limit the essay has, but even so, you could have picked one of the issues you've raised and delved deeper into it or you could have removed the last two lines of the second paragraph (the part about the number 3 and groups) and used that space to elaborate on your closing paragraph a bit more. The way it currently stands, you have decided to analyze everything in the story and because of the word limit, you've only been able to mostly list those things, and while the issues you've listed are extremely fascinating and enriching, they would have been even more enriching had you picked a specific aspect and analyzed that deeply.

I would disagree that the simplistic nature of the fairy tell reflects the time period because the idea of proposing on love at first sight is as  preposterous  as it is today, perhaps even more so because economics and alliance play less of a role in marriage.  I recommend Bruno Bettelheim's  The Uses of Enchantment  to anyone interested in a Freudian interpretation of fairy tales. It in part explains the simplistic nature of fairy tales through their connection to children. The children's sense of morality is different than ours and the endings we see as cruel or harsh actually have a sense of justice to them. On the other hand, evil sometimes wins and fairy tales introduce the notion that ""life isn't fair"" in a story that is short and more easily digested.  Anyways, I enjoy the stories for what they are, but I agree that they cannot be enjoyed if you do not realize that they are simplified, not because times were more simple, but because the stories are more symbolic and akin to Aesop's fables.  ;are we supposed to read all the stories from the gutenberg ebook?  ;Lauren, me too and Voyager is my Fave. I actually am even on the Bring Back Captain Janeway group on Facebook that campeigned for Janeway's return in the novels. It worked. :)  That aside, even the Voyager naysayers cannot deny that it was the lost innovative of the Treks since the original series with its ship designs, alien species, and planets.  As with anything Trek, Voyager was ahead if its time. If it were released a decade later, the female captain thing wouldn't be an issue...or as much as one, I stil meet backwards- thinking individuals who say a female captain is wrong and that hate Janeway because she's a female captain or they the Mulgrew, etc. Sad. ;Disclaimer: I came into Who during the Tennant years, which in some Old Who circles makes anything I say about Who instantly invalid. ;)However, I'm a huge Douglas Adams fan, and one of the things I love about Who is the slight camp nature of it (though, sadly, that seems to be falling by the wayside in the Moffat era of MORE SFX!)... so I immediately went back and devoured everything I could get my hands on, starting with Pirate Planet and then watching in order from the beginning. And I found things to love in every Doctor and almost every script. That experience leads me to believe two things:1. Old Whovians who complain so bitterly about New Who have a fundamentally different view of the show (perhaps colored by nostalgia) than someone who came into New Who and goes back to look at everything in Old Who as objectively as possible.2. New Whovians don't go back and look at Old Who nearly often enough (which probably feeds the animosity between the two groups - as a long time Beatles fan, I know the huge influx of Anthology fans *often* drove me mad with what I saw as stunning ignorance of everything that came before the Anthology, the importance of the Anthology to those of us who had been waiting for it for decades, damn kids get off my lawn, etc. I've been there).If there is any Doctor who fits less into the mold of ""The Doctor"" for *me*, it's Eleven... I find him to be disturbingly morally *ambiguous* (as opposed to ""morally following a different code to humans"") in a way none of the others have quite been. That's not a criticism of Matt Smith as much as the actual writing of Eleven - he's written in a more mercurial, more unpredictable way than any of his predecessors, to my eyes. But plenty of Old Whovians tell me I'm wrong and he reminds them of Troughton - I see what they mean, but I interpret it differently. A chacun son go  t!;Considering that this is a sci-fi and fantasy class, and therefore there are some literature buffs amongst us, I would also recommend: ""The Shakespeare Code"" (Season 3, Episode 2, Tennant). It has a very different flavor to the ones above, more fantastical with a little bit of history (and, of course, a little sci-fi). There's also some great stuff about the power of words.Don't get me wrong, I love all of the episodes above, but all but one were written by Steven Moffat, and there are many other talented writers in the Whoniverse.Edit: Oh, and lovers of steampunk, the episode you want is called ""The Next Doctor."" ;If you have any more specific questions, let me know.

When Orwell wrote that book, it was almost purely fantasy, science fiction.   But, now many of things he mentions in that novel exist today.   The idea of being watched at all times (Snowden anyone).     Any other dystopian future, Brave New World, Gattaca, Slaughterhouse 5, A Handmaid's Tale, Hunger Games, etc.     They are by far fantasy--they deal with unreal places that only exist in imagination--but they are grounded in the realities of the world within which they are written.   And scarily, many have been amazingly prescient.;I don't think its that his books are too long, I think it mind be the fact that what I know of his books they are more in the genre of ""adventure.""

We all know that Plath was not happy with the world of dreams, and embraced the darkness ""meaning to last it out..."" (see ""Lady Lazarus""), whereas Carroll wanted to sooth his troubled mind with the comfort of fantasy, wordplay, and logic. Thanks for sharing! I'm going to add that to my poem bank for teaching!;Three words:  Brave New World.  Why the hell don't we have feelies yet?;I felt a little odd with all the death talk in the lecture videos.

Books are not passive experiences, yet allow the reader to interact with them. Shakespeare is old, but in Huxley's  Brave New World (written in the 1930s) there is new life brought to Shakespeare's words when the protagonist finally has the life experiences that motivated the characters and events in  Othello and  The Tempest. Huxley's words ring true today, though they aren't too far from being a century old. Though Grimm is ""ancient"" and Bradbury ""old news"" in our class's genres, they still have themes worth discussing and exploring.There are bound to be a lot of omissions from the ""relevant"" list of Fantasy and Sci-Fi novels, but much of this list has seen the test of time. I would never have picked up  Alice  on my own, and though it's not a favorite, I have a newer way of looking at the world now.;So for ""Dr. Heidigger..."" and Poe, I'm thinking drink recipes... :)I'll have have to see if I can think up some baked goods/recipes to share.;If you're into looking at the Global machine of Disney, I'd suggest viewing ""Mickey Mouse Monopoly"" or reading The Mouse that Roared.

The video is particularly enlightening on the subject of the way Disney depicts women in different eras.One of the Disney films that would be a particularly good study for this of recent years is ""The Princess and the Frog."" It's one of the last traditionally animated films, and was largely swept under the rug by the ""princess"" movie  Tangled.;Hawthorne has some redeeming qualities, but Poe. Man, I'm an English teacher who'd divorce her husband in a hot minute for him if he were to be reborn. I have a thing for the sensitive, fragile ones.  Oh, the feels!;Hmm. Since when was being a paragon of Christian morality a requirement of romantic worthiness? To each his or her own. I merely prefer his unabashed exploration of his passion and his nightmares in fiction.  Also, was he a destructive alcoholic? Yes, to himself mostly. And to his finances at different points in his life. But with a relative that is trying to struggle with nearly 40 years of unchecked alcoholism, I know that it is a disease and not merely a sin of gluttonous proportions. I still love this family member.  I'm not going to even touch on the 13 year old bride. Jerry Lee Lewis suffered for this as much as Poe has to certain critics. I guess I just have to settle with the fact I'd not be his type. ;Also, a list of personal pain for Poe:-Birth father absent from his life.-Birth mother died.-Adopted.

And we try can't try to make any assumption that Renfield was completely sane or insane before this all happened. He is most importantly a plot device. Thanks for pointing out the pattern with his zoophagus behavior! That made me laugh.;It was written in VIctorian England. People who did not want to refer to chicken by ""breast"" and 'thigh,"" therefore the terms ""white meat"" and ""dark meat"" arose. Of course it's watered down.;Stick with me here, as I have to build upon a little bit of back story. Dracula's main object of sexual attention is Lucy when he comes to England. Lucy has just recently been won by Arthur, leaving two other men thwarted in their heterosexual desires. But Dracula usurps Arthur and the others in their desires, snatching Lucy away. After she is corrupted, they have no choice but to kill her and free her soul. By doing this, the men are left only with their friendship and unity over love for Lucy. There is an intense bond between these men, which seems to be typical of male friendships in the 19th century as depicted in literature. They use this bond as strength against Dracula, often not bothering to consult Mina, as Prof. Rabkin notes in his video lectures, which is exactly how they begin to lose her. Mina is the paragon of proper womanhood and wifeliness, all something the men would love to have, but the hypersexual Count once again steals this away from them, thwarting proper homosexual relations and the progeny that could spring from it. Heterosexual sex, biblically and functionally (especially in the Victorian era) was for having children only. Yet this was a period in history when women were medically treated for ""hysterics"" with the first vibrators, thus being introduced to another means of achieving le petit mort, specifically without a man involved. And the New Woman was one not necessarily dependent on men--what are men supposed to do without women, with all their desires and sexual urges? The Ancient Greeks had a way of doing this, that was also meant to help their noble women remain chaste and virginal: homosexual relationships. There were always prostitutes, but you had to pay for that, you could easily catch VD, and you couldn't go out on a hunt with them afterward (I'm extrapolating here). While there are absolutely no overt displays of homoerotics or homosexuality in this novel I can, however, understand that the bond between the men in this novel could be misconstrued. What I think that Stoker intended out of all of this was that men needed to keep the natural order, but should not dismiss women from the equation.Sorry if I rambled, this really got me thinking... Also, keep in mind that Stoker ""stole"" Wilde's woman, yet they remained stalwart friends. And Florence Stoker was notably frigid toward her husband, and as cited in the introduction to Barnes & Noble's annotated edition, much more of an ""ornament"" for her beauty, than a willing recipient of Bram's sexual attention. Therefore, where could Stoker himself find companionship and relief for sexual frustration?;I'm terrible with French, I apologize. Thank you for letting me know!;I would love to take a look at your essay if you would like to send it to me privately, or link it to me through Google Docs. I will willingly give you feedback and discuss your exploration. I am not opposed to homosexual interpretations of historic works.Also, please note that   I made an addendum to my post after re-reading the introduction of my copy.;Re: Stoker as the homophobic homosexual--could he possibly be frightened (as Jonathan Harker) of his magnetism to vampires (read: the Count himself)? Is Renfield a manifestation of what Stoker thinks would happen if he were to give into homosexual urges? Oh the possibilities... :);This is something that I have to wrestle with as a 7-12 educator, and I would like to say that, regardless of personal belief, I have been consistent in my grading. I will say that once Efthymia posts her her essay, I am bound to dig into it critically because I am so invested in the topic she is exploring. This goes along with your statement that an ""essay that makes you go back and look"" is a good one. For me, based on my reactions to students' work in the past, the ends of the spectrum are what challenge me most in grading, both positively and negatively, but it is the middle ground that is hardest to be kind to...;And it was Stoker's duty to be around the theatre and the creative minds of his era because of his work. Many of them were homosexual.;Just because we have some people who seem well versed in Christian theology, is it not sacrilegious, as a Catholic, to wear a rosary, and to use the Host in any manner other than the Eucharist?;What contribution I'd like to make to this discussion of ""Science"" and ""Faith,"" is the literary era in which this novel was written. Romanticism was over, but their are still fragments of it in this book. Stoker wrote of the social condition of the time, but was able, among the half-true scientifics, to construct a villain and a quest that appealed to the human condition, therefore transcending time into literary infamy. Stories constructed around social issues, often pandering to the middle-class, were highly typical of Victorian British literature. Sexual desire was almost a social disease, which had to be curable or explainable through phrenology, lobotomization, and other quasi-scientific explorations. Victorians were not the minds of the Enlightenment, nor the Restoration, nor the rational Augustans. They were the children of the Romantics, living in an ever shrinking world, trying to deal with the influx of foreign ideas and people when the great railways of the world were being laid.   This books is not  centrally science versus faith,  but us versus ""the other"" or ""the predator."" I think I'd like to explore this concept further as we go into Frankenstein though...;Even still are the Lamia of Ancient Greek myth. Not exactly our vampires, but we have seen the ""originals"" evolve into sparkly-fairy, nearly pedophiliac symbol of Mormon temptation within a century...;Snarky commentary on  Twilight (the author is Mormon, no reasoning behind that part of my comment other than that). Edward is over a hundred years old and falls in love with a teenage girl. His sexuality is tempting, but Bella does not give it up until marriage.

Please only respond if you are willing to discuss and work toward enlightenment on this topic.                 I am not including my essay here to use as an example for grading, because after careful review and reflection, my essay deserved the grade it received, a 4. It was a last minute effort because I was working on a project that has bearing on the degree I am working toward. Shame on me. I know I can do better.                 But as for those who are indeed grading the essays, I would like to prompt you to reflect on what feedback you are giving and how you structure it. This peer grading process begs for a highly structured rubric or process to ensure constructive feedback for those who truly want to learn. What has led me to say this is some reviewers seem to be under the impression that they know exactly the right answer, when with literary discourse, a right answer isn   t always the point. If it   s not from the horse   s mouth, so to speak, any literary analysis is speculation--theory. Getting down to philosophical brass tacks, what may seem to be purely empirical in literature is not necessarily so. Literature, on the receiving end, is an interactive process. Each one of us brings a particular understanding of culture and language, especially if English is not a first language.                That being said, I   m going to bring in a quote from our grading prompts to begin commentary on the    form    aspect of our responses:         An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.       I interpret Professor Rabkin   s preferred structure of response (correct me if I   m wrong) as giving the writer a compliment (with justification) and a suggestion for growth (with justification).                 So, to the person who wrote this for their review of my form:         peer 1     Your writings in several places are not academically fit in such kind of essay. The structure is a mix up that may lead to a confusion.            _shame on you. There is no constructive feedback here. It is lazy   without justification. I   m making the assumption I have a multi-lingual reviewer here. I warn you, before you read it, that what I have to say next will be slightly petty and aggressive. While the verb tenses agree,    such kind of essay    is not a    writings.    How can this reviewer tell me my structure is not    academically fit    when, firstly, she or he does not state precisely how it is a    mix up,    and struggles with conventions of usage of the English language her- or himself? Is it that she or he doesn   t understand how loaded the phrase    academically fit    is? Does this person mean something like,    In several places, the structure of the essay does not suit the parameters of the assignment well    instead?                            It is true that structure is very important in an academic essay. I will admit that though I separated my two body paragraphs into two opposing elements of imagery, I could have more clearly defined how I was going to do so in my thesis. We all have room for improvement. I, for one, did not come to this class to learn how to write, though. I do not understand why the grammar and structure should be graded at all by people who do not necessarily have an advanced degree in English composition or another appropriately credentialed field of study.                 My point with all that is please focus on the content of the ideas and the discourse they are attempting to spark. I wanted to talk about how light and dark were not mutually exclusive elements in Dracula, and that the opposition they represent within the book is a key to understanding the purpose of the novel. (Literally: day vs. night; fair/beautiful vs. dark/ugly. Figuratively: east/   the other    [dark] vs. west [light: e.g. enlightened west]                        (Man, I just said it infinitely better there than in my essay  _)                     And as for the peer who commented on terseness. I hate it. That   s why I left the field of journalism. I hate it with a passion, because this black and white approach to writing is very limiting, especially in the understanding and revelation it does little to encourage in the reader. I   m like Carroll, I like puzzles. Give me the baroque and rococo any day! (If you are lost in that last statement, see the story    Nativity, Caucasian    by my favorite author, Allan Gurganus.)                 Terseness and simplicity have a better place in industrial, interior, and product design (think IKEA) so that the products themselves do not distract from the function of the product. My form follows function, and it simply does not do to explore literature in a straight line. Also, to do such is indubitably boring. Because I cannot talk with you all face to face, I want to see    you    in your writing.                Okay, I   m done. Off the soapbox.    ;You definitely have some valid points. One thing I'd like to say, though, is that is it too much to ask that my peers to attempt to take the same care they take writing their essays with their reviews? I doubt many have taken a class on how to grade or give feedback. I have taken several, and written a scholarly paper on it. My rant is more along the lines of identifying lack of self-reflection and the need for more constructive feedback.i will point out that we have  very clear parameters for reviewing the essays: one positive thing the reviewer liked, and an area for improvement. Some of the reviews that I didn't include here were borderline  scathing, but buried in ill-chosen connotation and phrasing, there were valuable observations and advice--and compliments.Also, I prefaced my picking at the reviewer's grammar with its pettiness. What I  really disliked was the lack of effort taken, and the fact that it was nothing but negative. What I posted was  the entire review.;As to the ""take a course you pay for comment,"" I don't know if you understand the infeasibility of that for me. I currently am living at the poverty line with luck enough to have Internet access and the ability to take out loans for school relevant to my chosen area of study (of which college level discussions of literature is not). There is an individual on another thread that revealed she was middle aged and taking this because she never got a chance to take classes like this before.  What I aimed for in my post, besides including some colorful ranting, was to ask for my peers to reflect on their contributions and consider changing how they evaluate. I am even reflecting now on how I need to structure my own responses. ;On the contrary, you do not stray too far from the purpose of my original post. This last post of yours is perhaps the most enlightening, especially with the information on MOOCs. This is what I hope to start with my original post--discourse. Thanks for the statistics you shared. On a different vein, I have taken Internet courses for my university where discussion bird posting was mandatory.

The bride, a symbol of innocence, is uncomfortable in the presence of her bridegroom. The story gives a picture of her as a sweet, innocent girl as it refers to her as the ""pretty bride"" who should not go where ""evil things betide.""I was also intrigued by the line, ""Death will be your spouse."" The image of the bride being devoured by her husband seemed reminiscent of the way woman were thought of as property during medieval times. By getting married, you were giving away the right to make your own decisions and your own personhood.The imagery of the peas and lentils having budded overnight also stood out to me as being about lost innocence. Peas bud when fertilized, and the girl lost her innocence by watching them eat the other girl. ;Thanks! I think it probably will be.;I really like your analysis of this! That is intriguing on the multiple natures of society. The interesting thing about fairy tales is that most characters are either all bad or all good, which is never true in real life. Even the best of us flaws, and even the worst of humanity has good moments.I think the gender roles are important in that the mouse is the one who had to stay home all day keeping house, and so she missed the chance to ""eat the fat"" or see all the world has to offer. The cat is also dismissive of her contributions and opinions, saying, ""That's because you are always sitting at home in your little grey frock and hairy tail, never seeing the world, and fancying all sorts of things."" In the end, she ends up getting taken advantage of and killed. It is interesting that another story, ""Hans in Luck,"" also seemed a warning against being too trusting.;I agree. Clever Gretel in particular bothered me. Looking at it from a strict morality standpoint, you wonder why she gets away with it all. The purpose of that tale almost seemed to be to teach children not to trust others, and perhaps they would have an easier time of it than if they had to learn the lesson the hard way- through life experience. There's still a part of me that thinks, though, they will learn that the world is not all good, life is not fair, ect. soon enough, why not let them enjoy their childhood innocence a little longer?;I wonder if in some instances it did have religious implications for the  author/reader, especially considering the time period in which it was  written. I noticed in Faithful John, there were three ravens discussing  the three tragedies/tests that would befall the King before he could  marry the beautiful woman. The story reached a turning point for the  better when both Faithful John and the two prince's lives were saved  (three lives!) while the Queen was at her prayers in the church. The authors could have had her be anywhere. I think in this case it was deliberate references, considering the importance the number three has always had to the church. ;Is anyone else here from Oklahoma?;I had read many of these tales as a child, but I was amazed by all the stuff I missed when I was younger! It was fun to analyze them as an adult rather than just hearing them through the simplistic viewpoint of a child. Pretty sure I missed all the symbolism back then and just focused on the plot.;"

I was intrigued by the scene when Alice was trying to go through the door into the garden and was always either too big or too little. I think it was a commentary on the changes that occur when growing up, when you outgrow some activities but are still too young to participate in some of the rituals of adulthood.;In the first book, Alice is moving within a clearly defined universe, with only so many stopping places that are all intertwined. She starts in the rabbit hole, which leads to the small room with a door to the garden and a key. Then in traveling around Wonderland, all the characters are interrelated to each other, with the tea party characters, the Duchess, the  Cheshire cat  and the white rabbit showing up later at the Queen's croquet. Wonderland seems to revolve around the Queen and her croquet, as even she is not present, the Cheshire cat, the white Rabbit and the Duchess all mention her and seem very interested/involved with her.;I agree that programs used to spot grammatical mistakes do not catch anything but the most obvious mistakes. ;Carrol seems to have captured the feeling of a dream perfectly in both stories, both with Alice's vague sense of frustration with the logic of the things that happen and with the scenery shifting so abruptly. I frequently have that happen in dreams. First I am one place, then another, with nor rhyme or reason to it.;I just gave an essay a six for the first time in this course. It had a unique thesis that made me think about the story in a new light, and was proved by examples from the story and the author's interpretation of those. It had impeccable grammar and sentence structure, and I could not think of a single way that the author could improve his/her essay within the word count allowed. In fact, I wished the word count was higher, so the author could give more examples and develop it further. So, for me at least, that is what makes an outstanding essay.;I am going to an Alice and Wonderland-themed fundraiser in my hometown for a nonprofit later this week, so I think it's pretty pervasive. It is also referenced in numerous pop culture and literary works, including being a running theme in the Matrix movie trilogy.;I found Carroll's use of morals in the scene with the Duchess at the croquet game to be interesting. Especially after just reading the Grimm tales, where the morals were the main point of the stories, it seemed that Carroll was gently mocking that genre of literature. The Duchess finds a moral in everything, and they rarely make much sense. For instance, at one point, she says, ""Flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is- 'Birds of a feather flock together.'"" Here Carroll is having the Duchess spout out common sayings during the Victorian period as morals, often contradicting herself.Carroll also used her morals to show off some of his amusing wordplay. I loved the line, ""There's a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is - 'The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.'"" What do you all think the point was of the scene involving the Duchess and the morals?';I really like third person, especially if the author allows you to see the same scene from multiple perspectives. You don't have to use first person to be in someone's head. One of my favorite authors of all time, Orson Scott Card, tells the exact same story from two different perspectives in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Another favorite is the Time Traveler's Wife, where you shift back and forth between Clare and Henry's perspective, all while staying in third person. For those of you who like first person, what are some examples of your favorite writing that uses this?;"

When they kill Dracula, Mina says that ""I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there."" I don't think the author primarily intended the story to be an action/fight book.;I also thought the use of the communion wafer to keep them safe was interesting. Bram Stoker seems to be Catholic, as some of his terminology - the rosary, calling communion the Host - is specifically Catholic. In communion, many Catholics believe the wafer, or bread, becomes the body of Christ and the wine becomes the blood. The blood of Christ has healing, redemptive power in Christian tradition. It is the symbol of forgiveness of sins.As Peter points out above, Lucy is rejuvenated through pure blood. Conversely, when Dracula forces Mina to swallow his blood, it binds her to him. He says, ""And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin.""I found these references to blood and the Christian tradition very interesting.;Very good analysis!

That said, I think Mary Shelley purposely made the monster a thwarted Adam- an Adam without an Eve. We are sympathetic because we cannot imagine being the only one of our kind in the universe. Shelley is telling a different kind of creation story than the one told in both Genesis and Paradise Lost, as Natasha noted above. A flawed man can only create a flawed creation.;Like Dracula, this book contains references to Christianity, particularly in its discussion of the relationship between creator and creation. This can be read several ways. The monster resents his creation in such a form that all others despise him, and he was given no mate. It is interesting that Paradise Lost, Milton's dramatic retelling of both the fall of Satan and the fall of mankind, was one of the three books the monster read early in his development. The monster himself wonders where his place was in the story, when he says, ""Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for  often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter  gall of envy rose within me.""Satan was rumored envious of God's throne, and in Paradise Lost, staged a failed coup to try to take it.Later, when vowing his revenge after Frankenstein has denied him his bride, his Eve, he says, ""I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom."" The snake (Satan) waited in the grass in Paradise Lost, to tempt the woman to eat the apple. The monster remains focused on ruining his creator, just as Satan in Paradise Lost is waging war against God, his creator, by ""ruining"" humankind through temptation and the fall.What do you all think of Shelley's hints that the monster might be Satan in the creation story?;I think Frankenstein's monster represents the darker side of Frankenstein himself and humanity as a whole. I think Mary Shelley intended the text to have an actual monster, but for the reader to infer that Frankenstein represented something more. ;Yes, that is interesting.

I think that this particular fairy tale is still a great story  which can help  us adapt  to the world we live in now... (Even thus, I always am a bit annoyed when the hero chooses a girl to marry and she  doesn't seem to have a word to say about that  ;) Anyway I will not discuss any of those aspects in my paper, and instead I will look at highly interesting themes, the way they are symbolised and articulated together.;A car or a wain drawn by the horses is an ancient symbol of the sun  travelling along the firmament. It is very archaic for it is shared by  many cultures. White horses = morning sun, red ones = noon sun, black =  night sun being carried beneath the ground (according to the ancient  belief).The folktales were retold through centuries, passing from  one generation to another. The surroundings and ways of life changed,  much of the older myths and traditions were forgotten, meaning of some  was lost or transformed. New traditions were created, new details that  concerned current life were added. Each fairy tale developed as a living  organism, changed, aged, gave its offsprings, merged with others. And  writing it down means stopping this development. Printed word could be  only reprinted, misprint is a fault (we can play it at the stage, make a  film etc., but it's quite a different story).""The Raven"" is a good illustration: it contains very archaic elements as well as rather modern. For example, the letter and the maps.  I'm sure they were added lately. But not before the words on the paper became a common thing: in this tale the literate person is a  magician or a sorceress. A land-chart is a miracle! You can find any town you want:  what an amazing thing!(And just a little guess. The giant  mentions a child left in the house. I think it's a snatch of older plot  layer: there might have been three brothers, big, middle and little, but  the original episode was replaced to the one with maps though this  irrelative child stayed. Just an assumption. :D)And one more interpretation of red. Fire? White and black: day and night? Light and darkness?White - red - black may suggest to a contemporary reader changing feelings: hope - alarm - despair. :);Thank you!The article is googlable.;I've just finished this story and it stroke me that in addition to other interpretations it might contain some implications of adultery: the cat takes a husband's role and the mouse stands for a wife (in the translation to my language both the cat and the mouse are ""she"", by the way), the pot of fat symbolizes the marriage (or maybe its physical aspect), hiding it in the church    \approx wedding and vowing, even the kittens may stand for children born outside marriage. Different species may even symbolize an unequal match. :D;I like your interpretation!;That's nice! Intrapersonal relations instead of interpersonal ones!;""Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.

I can see the humor in it, and I can see the literary importance - but I just can't get myself to actually enjoy a single one of their writings.;This is all making me wonder about how people in early 19th c. rural Germany conceptualised ""luck"". I know that the concept of individual identity was quite different in some ways, so was ""luck"" more like the modern notion of random chance or the idea of ""luck"" as an inherent quality you carry about with you (which was prevalent in my neck of the woods, and still continues with the idea that a person can be innately ""lucky"").Not very helpful. Just mulling.;I think that luck itself plays an extremely important role in most of the fairy tales. Like, even if luck is not directly mentioned, a person can be lucky by being cunning and intelligent (like in clever Gretel, six soldiers of fortune, and the rabbits bride) Gretel is lucky because she doesn't get caught due to her intelligence, and the six soldiers use their skills to outsmart the king which is complete luck in itself that they all came together. Also the maiden in The Rabbits Bride is lucky that she was able to trick the rabbit and return home. Luck also plays roles in many stories of heroism, and the like.;One of my favorite editions of ""Household Tales"" begins with an introduction by A.S. Byatt and she does a fabulous job of outlining what makes these tales so enduring. That introduction is well worth the read. ;OK;Rebecca, that is really insightful. We tend to lump the Grimm collection together as ""fairy tales"", and because fairy tales have become morality tales, it's hard to get round our expectations of what the Tales were at the time.  ;What I think is interesting is that there's so much scope for acting out these tales, as Anahita mentioned in relation to her grandmother. They're so succinct and spared of detailed description that they make the imagination work really hard and that provides huge artistic licence when it comes to taking it from the book and back to oral tradition where it came from. I think the point about patterns is a good one, especially when we look at the tales from an oral perspective. It's like in the Odyssey where there are set phrases that repeat again and again.  ;As I said, much argument in many directions. I thought it an interesting perspective, in current times as well with LOTR and Song of Fire and Ice (Lewis obviously used symbols from his tradition, yet still honored ancient motifs)...it's nice to know that the old themes still ring true.In terms of Disney, he was speaking mainly of Fantasia, the use of having Mickey as an apprentice to a Sorcerer, he contrasted that with books that had been banned at the time for obvious witchcraft symbolism...;I love that you figured this out.

The retribution the six soldiers get would be well suited for a retelling from a modern veteran's point of view.;Cheri, I think you've hit the nail on the head for me, thank you - Irish tales have depth of character (and, often, development of character). Even if you look across versions, the Fionn from the Salmon of Knowledge tale is not quite the same Fionn from the Giant's Causeway tale - and not just because he can access greater knowledge by sucking his thumb. He has grown and developed in that time. There is a sense of forward momentum.Karen, your point about the greater development of Irish tales is well taken. If there is a difference between the Grimm tales and Irish tales in that respect though, I would suggest that it's more due to *cultural* underpinnings than historical ones. My ancestry is not terribly distantly German and Irish, and I have noticed that my German relations tend to tell their folktales the same way each time - small details may differ, but on the whole, it is the same tale. That's not a criticism - consistency across versions may well be why the Grimms were able to compile the tales in the first place. Irish culture, on the other hand, encourages the storyteller to make the story their own. There are as many distinct versions of Cuchulainn/Setanta as there are people who know his stories - and more. There are some versions which feel like heresy (and which ones those are will differ from person to person) and everyone is convinced that only *they* know the ""right"" ones. I *have* encountered that with Grimm and other germanic tales, but not often. I have also heard Irish storytellers tell ""their versions"" drastically differently on two different nights, because ""the night is different, so the story must be, too."" (Woody Guthrie made many similar statements over the years regarding his music.) This aspect of Irish folktales sounds very romantic, but it can often be very *frustrating* - a close friend of the family once told the best version of Children of Lir I've ever heard, and he's not repeated it since. Not because he doesn't want to (although that may be true), but he literally doesn't remember it. So, I'm stuck with hazy memories of a particular night when I was 12, and a particular version I loved, don't remember the details of, and can never hear again... but, my friend points out, am I not better for hearing it the once?Irish culture *embraces* the transientness and individuality of oral storytelling with an enthusiasm unlike any other culture I know of. The most important part of the story is the experience of hearing it - the words are seen as the vehicle, not the destination.That's not to say the Irish have cornered the market on that notion - I have known fantastic storytellers of all nationalities. But the Irish have a sort of cultural endorsement at their backs, that of *course* everyone's story will always be different and of *course* there is no one ""proper"" tale - just the right tale for the right experience on the right night with the right people. This notion goes all the way back to the social position of the bards in Ancient Irish culture - the bard was second in status only to the King, because the bard held all the history.On Irish Nationalism and Home Rule - I could write a thread's worth of posts on that, but they'd be outside the scope of this course, and I don't want to bore anyone to death. :) I will say you're correct to a certain degree - if you look at very early versions of Irish fairytales, they are less romanticized than the ones we tell now. However, they are less different than you'd think. With the caveat that I do not *speak* Sean-Ghaeilge (the kind of Irish we're talking about if you're going that far back in history, pre-Home Rule) I speak enough Modern Irish to have puzzled out pieces of the early written versions. (There are also still a bare handful of Sean-Ghaeilge scholars who are busily translating everything they can get their hands on into Irish and English before those manuscripts are lost to us - their work has been invaluable to me in my poking around.) That's not to say that the history of Ireland hasn't affected the stories... that would be an impossible and ridiculous claim to make. Morgan Llwellyn is probably one of the best known authors who retells the old tales through an oft (but not always) Republican/Nationalist lens, and is a good author to check out if you want to compare those retellings to other ones. But it's important to remember that, as with the Germanic tales, Irish tales so predate written language that the people who tell them tend to resist allowing political machinations to make much of a dent in the way they tell the story.;Jacob (Isaac's son) fell victim to the bride and switch, yes, but it was never put right the way the Grimms' stories do: the sisters were bitter rivals, and the competition for sons got pretty ugly, right down to sending their servants in for Jacob to impregnate.;Don't be ridiculous.   *Everyone* at Michigan is cute.But I was more interested in knowing who we should be paying close attention to in the forum.;In Grimm, the tails of furry woodland creatures seem to be a popular mode of transportation, even for male protagonists.

Also because he's the title character the reader might be primed to be on his side (although this doesn't work with every title character - Dracula).

I think this is  about the third time I've read both  Dracula and Frankenstein and I've been noticing how  (only sometimes) badly written Dracula is and how well-written Frankenstein is.

She had that high wall around her garden and still had her garden raided. I assume that as a witch she was an outcast character but still she disserved justice, and that   s what I see initially here is that she got justice, though she set it at a terrible price for the parents to pay. They seemed to be the initial instigators of this story? What were the standards of unusual punishment then? I think the penalty for a lot of crimes, was death. Yet I think we see that the witches harshness to Rapunzel justified her freedom in the end.  ;Kind of like loading the trap with cheese huh, it's a thought.;Fantastic comment.;I think her rights might depend on the culture? In our society when she became an adult she would be free to make her decisions, but I   m not sure if they would see it that way, a couple hundred years ago, in a different culture?  ;Wow that was very interesting. I didn   t know that about Medusa. It makes you see the story differently when you see the witch as Athena.

Here she was in the country, but had to allow her attacker in herself? Is that how this situation would be understood?  ;Some good thoughts!;I wonder if it has anything to do with where the stories came from? Who was telling the stories and who was the audience? Were the stories told mostly by women in the house? Were they told to mostly to children? Do you suppose the men in their circles and amongst themselves told different stories? There were a lot of stories with girls in negative roles but also a lot of them had characters in which the girls were very positive. The goose girl, the story of the sister in the 12 brothers, Grehel, there are a lot of situations where there is a humble industrious girl as opposed to a lazy self-centered girl? Do you think these were mostly tales to encourage girls to live such lives? There don   t seem to be as many similar portrayals of boys?   ;I don   t see men as the evil heart of these stories. In the Hansel and Gretel tale Hansel initially takes the actions to save Gretel and himself, but in the end Gretel has to find the courage to take action and save them both. Another story that comes to mind is the Raven in which the woman initiates the action to free herself, but the hero needs to first rise above his weaknesses, and find the strength to free her. She initiated the action first though. I don   t see characters in any of these stories that are the bulging heroes in the movies we have today, male or female. Again the Raven has the example, seen in other tales where the hero goes out into the world, and attracts the characters of strength that actually overcome the hurdles. He is only the determined leader. Also As I   ve asked other places, do you think these are tales told by men, or women in the societies. I think they are more likely to be the tales the women have passed down and told to the children. I don   t see these as   tales the men would tell in their circles?  ;Wow thanks for those references. They were very interesting as to why these tales were written and apparently where they were coming from. My German isn   t the best, but it looks like the Grimms were motivated to try and preserve a sense of German culture before it was buried under the French culture.

Anderson creates his stories out of his own experiences, so they reflect his own life concerns.   He did not feel he fit in, he did feel lonely, and he did yearn for closer connections to others as you note.   As the artist, his concerns passed through the crucible of his imagination to emerge as his tales.   Good for you for noticing Anderson, as the sole creator of his tales, has a consistent theme; however, The Grimms, who recorded the oral materials and tried to produce a finished tale by including what was common to the oral stories they recorded, produced material that widely reflected the concerns of a whole culture rather than one artist.   ;My take on Alice is that the Identity theme is the predominant one in the text but Carroll is exhaustive in his exploration and questioning of what constitutes one's identity.   He starts with the concept of time with the Rabbit whose watch constantly tells him how late he is.   Carroll questions all aspects of how the individual understands language and our use of language impacts our construct of time.   So, the Mad Hatter and March Hare ask Alice if she knows time to which she replies that she can beat time when she plays music.   The Hatter notes that Time will not stand to be beaten so she can not know him very well.    For Carroll, what is time?   Because we define it in language which is a human construct, does time exit as the human conceives it, does it shift with perspective (Einstein's relativity theory), or does it exist only in the physical universe with the sun's movement from light to dark??    Carroll turns Alice's brain upside down and inside out with his language explorations, and isn't the the child's experience of the world as she grows within time??Just some fascination with Carroll's concern with time and its impact on everything, but especially on creating the framework that limits our understanding of the world.   A lot of questions......;I would call applying Freud's Electra Complex theory to Gretel the 'subtext' of the story rather than 'back story"" which is a confusing and non-technical term.   Another parallel to 'back story' might be to see a Greek myth as the 'bones' on which the Hansel and Gretel was built.   The technical term for this is 'palimpsest', but the phrase 'back story' could be used to avoid the technical term but using layman's terms leads to confusion.   To apply psychological theories to literature has been very popular but the Freudian stuff is from the mid twentieth century.   Why not apply other, more recent psychologists for interpretation?   Why not see Gretel's finally separating from Hansel's protection and taking the independent choice to save both of them as her development of a new identity separate from her dependence on her father or brother??   Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development would apply here.   Why not apply Erickson's stages of psychosocial development to her??   Erickson's theories would work too!!   Why Freud??   Sex Sells!!!   To interpret, one needs to a new way of seeing the old story and to shock the reader while doing so.   How many times does someone say to himself, ""Now, why didn't I see that!   What is wrong with me?""   Isn't that how we feel in the presence of ""The Professional?""   So, I am proud and pleased that my fellow students do not swallow interpretations whole but question them no matter whose they are!!

Either way, the accusation itself is very serious and needed to be handled by the course staff.   The program should be set so that if the word 'plagiarism' occurs, the evaluation kicks off to the staff who investigate the situation and rectify it.   As an educator myself, I know that students plagiarize frequently and think nothing of it.   On the college level, the professional obligation is to educate students not only as to what plagiarism is but also how serious it is by treating it   as a serious ethical offense with consequences.

The demand for 'paragraphs of 3 lines (not sentences)' and to 'make the format pleasing to the eye' is a result of advertising, television, and other popular media training the present generation to short bursts of information because their attention span is too short for media handled by previous generations.   USA Today began the trend to short bursts which has been followed by our popular newspapers and magazines, but to everyone's detriment.   Content is then sacrificed to a 'pleasing' format.   Brevity is not always the best goal and brevity may even train patience out of readers who refuse to use perseverance to gain worthwhile insights.

I remember staring at it as I waited and I'm sure it influenced a lot of childhood dreams.;My parents read to me a lot when I was younger, but I rarely picked up a book on my own. After they divorced, neither of them had a lot of time to read to me before bed, and I was more against reading on my own than ever, because it required too much effort. I despised most of the books I was forced to read in high school, despite my sister's help. I was a stereotypical jock, for awhile, and reading was just not cool, anyway. Then, I got to college. My roommate was reading all the time, and wanting to talk about what he was reading with me. He loaned me a few books, like Slaughterhouse 5, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Lord of the Rings, and The Sun Also Rises. I've been an avid reader ever since and even joined a university book club! I have also revisited some of those high school books I hated and come to respect them (if not outright enjoy them). Well, except for Jane Eyre. I will forever hold a grudge against that book. Haha.;I'm kind of surprised at the anger the Grimm tales have caused with some people. First of all, I assumed as fantasy and sci-fi fans, most people had already read them (or at least versions of them). If the stories were so lame and meaningless, why are we still talking about them now? Why have they inspired an unlimited amount of retellings, art, essays, and historical research? I think many people are too quick to judge something that they 'hate' or think is pointless before they sit back and think about it on a deeper level. I used to judge things (especially books) too quickly when I was in high school. If I didn't like a book by the first few pages, I dismissed it as worthless. Now, though, I have learned to give things a bigger chance. There's a lot to be gleaned from the fairy tales, and all the other readings in this course if you give them all a fair chance.;Few people study the books that present a perfect world in which every character gets along with every other character, no one is judgmental, and there are no conflicts. There's nothing to be learned from them! By reading literature that contains controversial issues, we can examine the changes of our world, positive and negative, and become more accepting individuals ourselves. Look at this as a learning experience.;Karen:I was not saying that conflict means violence. Where did you get that? I meant, that any kind of controversial concept adds much to the reading (and without it, would be boring). Language, character attitudes, stereotypes, society, perspective or perception, etc.  Kate:Bear in mind, these books, or many of them, were written in a different time. People thought differently, society was different, etc. And though some would disagree with me, I think we have come a long way when it comes to prejudice and bigotry. It is still out there, though and just this fact alone makes it worthwhile to read books with bigotry displayed so that we can understand it from a variety of perspectives. And challenge it ourselves. That is the power of individuality. We don't need to be told by some disclaimer at the beginning of every book what to think. We have the ability to do it on our own.;Agreed. Plain and simple.;"

In regards to the SF/F split (what makes something Sci-Fi and what makes something Fantasy) I think it is not so clear. Casey mentions that maybe this is similar to the split between science and religion, that science attempts to explain how everything is done while religion looks at it with awe and wonder. While this is a good point to bring up, I respectfully disagree to an extent. For instance, there is a lot of awe and wonder in science and a lot of trying to explain the why and wherefores in religion (though typically through methods quite different than the scientific method).  I speculate here, but indulge me a bit...is the main difference between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that the former incorporates technology and the latter incorporate magic? Somebody brought up Frankenstein. This is a wonderful example. Is this Sci-Fi? Is this Fantasy? Is this both? Does it matter?  ;Bryant,I know the creators of Grimm Fairytales personally.

It's just because of the history of comics. I watched a documentary on the history of comics once. It was really enlightening and showed just how much they struggled just to make their superheroes when the rest of the world scorned them. They did follow the trend of the cheap paperback novels in terms of mystery, western, sci fi with a damsel in distress. That sort of thing. I'll have to find it again, I'll post the link when I do.

You notice that in many of their stories such as Snow White maidens are young naive girls who fall into temptation like in Adam and Eve.   Women on the other hand are fueled by sin.   The Snow White Queen was fueled by Envy  and Pride, The mother in ""Hansel and Gretel"" and  the hen in ""The Death of the Hen""    and the wife in ""The fisherman and his Wife""(?) were fueled by Greed.;I honestly think the Grimm brothers were trying to emulate the original sin of temptation in Adam and Eve along with the blatant misogyny within their writings. ""Maidens"" within Grimm writings are young, naive, and can easily fall to temptation, like in the Rabbit's Bride, or when Snow White takes the poisoned apple.   Women and Mother figures are usually seen as sinful and take actions based on their sins.   The Evil Queen tries to kill Snow out of envy and the fisherman's wife made her husband make extravagant wishes out of greed.   Their sins motivate them and consumes them.

I personally prefer to not have spoilers, but tend to read analyses in parallel with the reading.However, there are many different ways to experience writing, and I believe all are valid.;Depending on the translation and the edition of tales used in the translation, the word little would show more or less often.   My reading of the history of Grimms' tales is that the original written record of oral tradition was intended for other scholars.   As children began to be common readers of the tales, the Grimms added diminutives, moral endings and religious references in subsequent editions to be able to market to a larger audience.   They also diminished the sexual content (see various versions of Rapunzel) over time.I'm surprised that ""three"" is not larger.;Christopher, the word cloud is visually appealing and interesting.    Very nice idea.   What text did you use to make it?   Does Wordle allow you to consolidate conjugations of verbs and consolidate noun forms, such as plurals, possessives and singulars?   One thing that does not show is how often words, phrases or episodes are repeated.   I think the repetitions in threes are underrepresented in the word cloud.Cheers, Martha Ellen;The red/black/white imagery does echo the theme of threes.   There seems to be another with silver/gold/steel.I wonder whether red symbolizes blood which in turn symbolizes lost of purity.   For instance, the pricking of a finger results in red blood.   Is that just a symbol for the blood shed when virginity is lost?Remember all those Westerns where the good man is in white and the bad in black?   Retelling of fairy tales?   And red in those movies represented the woman of low morals.;I was wondering that myself.   I didn't writing something down that Dr. Rabkin had said and then I wanted to find it again later.   I couldn't remember which video it was in and didn't want to relisten to them all.   Being able to do a text search on the lecture would be so much easier.As someone who had difficulty listening, I use the closed captions during the lectures.   I appreciate being able to speed up the lecture since I read faster than I can listen, but I still get the facial expressions and gestures of the speaker.   However, I find the captions don't appear at the same time as they are spoken.   Makes for interesting (sometimes difficult) experiences.   It helps with spelling and understanding of words or names that I wouldn't be able to understand with only spoken language.;When we grade/comment on others work, is it done anonymously (i.e., blind to their identity)?   I am used to putting the typical header in MLA style documentation (My name, Course, Instructor name, date), and I am wondering whether I should omit my name.   Thanks,   Martha Ellen;Several numbers show up, although not as often as 3:   2 (couples, birds on Cinderella's shoulders, giants to be slain), 7 (7 goslings or goats, dwarves), 12 (brothers).   I asked a German professor friend who has read the tales in German (but not sure which iteration of the tales - the ones meant for other scholars or the ones tamed down for children).   Her response was that the numbers had magical qualities rather than religious.   There is the adage that when teaching you repeat something 3 times for someone to learn/remember it.   There could be a little of that theory behind the repetition of phrases or words 3 times in the tales, especially since these stories are supposed to be written records of oral tradition.   Three is generally a nice number - not too many and not too few.;Just thought of this.   In art there is a ""rule of odds"" that says a composition is more visually interesting if there are an odd number of items.   The theory is that in an even number the viewer automatically pairs items and then stops thinking about the piece.   With an odd number of items, the viewer is constantly rearranging the pieces in the mind and the interest in the piece lasts longer.   Could the same be true of literature?And another thing about 3 in a mathematical sense:   we tend to look for patterns in lists that are 3 or more long, while in lists of 2 we only compare and contrast.   So, by having a surprise appear in the third item in a list, we have developed a certain expectation that we would not have if the surprise is in the second item in the list.   On the other hand, having the surprise in the fourth item in a list would be too late - the pattern is established and the surprise would be jarring instead of pleasant.Cheers.   ;Thank you, Brian.   And Marla, thanks for confirming my theory about the 4th item in a list.   I wondered if it was just me.;The problem summary:   This isn't a problem as much as a suggestion.   I particularly like the course calendar (and the printable versions that other students have made available).   See link to calendar below.   However, it would be useful to have a checkbox beside each item in the list so I could keep track for myself what I have done and not done.   This is available on Moodle and I'm afraid that I have become addicted to using it (See example screen shot below).   I can easily see that I need to still finish Quiz Day 12 but have done the other two requirements).Thanks.Link:   https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/wiki/view?page=CourseCalendarScreen shot example:   ;I am a book blogger and am used to writing a post about each book I read and posting reviews on various book websites like LibraryThing and Amazon.Is it a violation of the academic integrity of the course if I post a blog entry or write a review during the course or do I need to schedule the posts to appear after the course is over?   While taking a literature course, the content of my blog post and my essays (or other assignments) are very closely related, and often the blog post is a draft of what I plan to submit.Please let me know and I will act accordingly so that I abide by the requirements of the academic integrity of the course.Thank you,  Martha Ellen;Hello, I have been waiting for an assignment link to appear on the left with all the other links (to Home, Course Information, etc.)   I see that the due date for the first assignment has passed already, but frankly I didn't know where to submit it.(Also, would prefer the due date to be 12 noon or 12 midnight, assumed 12 pm was midnight instead of noon)Thanks for help on this issue.Martha Ellen;A link would be helpful.   Locating all other information about the course seems intuitive except submitting assignments.Thanks for the information.;Is that the only place to find the assignments?   I have been tending to come to the pages directly to the forums from my e-mail notifications, and that right-hand notification bar does not appear there.   I assumed you could access all course materials from the left-hand bar - something that showed up on all pages.   Thanks for the information.;Glad to know I'm not alone.  ;I would like to get feedback on my essay even if it doesn't count for the class.   I'm going to put another forum post out for those that missed the deadline.   Maybe we can share between us and get feedback that way.;For those of us who missed the submission deadline (either because we assumed 12pm was midnight instead of noon, or because there is no assignments link on the left-hand navigation bar (at least none say Assignments)):Could we find some way to share among ourselves so that we can at least get some feedback?   Say, make a deadline of 12 midnight EDT tonight.   How could we do the sharing so that the essays are distributed equally?   Thoughts?Also, I have found out from others that the assignment link is hidden on the left-hand-side navigation panel under Peer Responses (I assumed that would be where we would go after submitting assignments, and not to submit the assignment itself).;Sounds easy to do, Vignesh.;Vignesh,   I thought the deadline was midnight tonight to begin with.   My post will be up later this evening.   :);Agree, Ritu.   We students should help each other with reminders in the forums.   Thanks for your comments, Olena.   I applaud all of those who were willing to post their essays here where it is not anonymous.I am sure that constructive criticism for the essays below would be welcome from anyone.;I agree that the stories often divide personality traits of one person into different characters in the story, and in fact, that was part of my argument.I agree with Samantha on form.   I could clearly identify your thesis, and the sentence structure and style made reading easy.   On the other hand, paragraph structure would have aided the reader and some word choice was unusual enough (depictive) to require a second reading of some paragraphs (in fact, depictive is not in my computer's dictionary).As for content, you state what you believe the symbols mean, but do not provide arguments for each.   At 278 words (by MS Word's count) there was room for expansion of some of your ideas.   I also suspect that you choice of imagery may have drawn on cultural references that not everyone is aware of, and so another option for expansion might have been to put the references into context for the reader.Thanks for sharing your essay, Vignesh, and here is to hoping that we all meet the deadline in the future.;I appreciated the evidence provided from the text.   It is my experience with students that they are willing to make a claim, but not always able to provide references to substantiate the claim, but this essay does that nicely.However, in the last paragraph there is a universal claim that only three types of people change Fate.   I am reminded of something Dr. Rabkin said in his introductory lectures:   seek out counterexamples.   I suspect that examples of people who can change Fate can be found other than those you have stated.   If so, then the claim is weakened.The writing is well done and easy to read.   Well done.;Andres, first a comment on your writing.   Even before I reached your final statement, I suspected that you were not a native speaker of English, and the types of mistakes that you made are the counterparts of the mistakes I make when I am writing in Spanish.   Your paragraph structure is well done, and the mistakes are with close-homonyms like tale (a noun) and tell (a verb) and other word forms like prove (a verb) instead of proof (a noun) and ethnics for ethnicities.   A spell-checker alone will not catch these word substitutions.   I have no other recommendation other than asking a native English speaker to read over your essays if possible.The thesis of a dichotomy is well stated and the second paragraph helps provide an argument.   However, the essay wandered from the thesis into the concept of story-telling and the oral tradition.   The connection between that and the thesis could be strengthened.Esta bien.   Buena suerte en la clase.    ;Kathy, thank you for submitting your essay in this public forum.The essay has strong sentence and paragraph structure.   As for the word count comment above, MS Word counted 319 words, the same number I used in my essay and within the 280-320 count required, so that does not seem to be a problem at all.The argument is on point with specific evidence to justify the claims.   However, for such a short essay, a three-part thesis is ambitious.   While a good essay, it could be improved by focusing more on one point and expanding the explanations in the argument.Well done, and see you around the forum.;I agree, Stephanie.   I had expected a staff member to chime in here sometime, and possibly some action taken.   However, I am excited that those of us who made a good-faith effort to meet the deadline were willing to share their work in this public, not anonymous forum.   Short of increased clarity in the website structure, we can help each other with reminders on the forum for when and how to submit the next essay.Cheers.;Okay, in the nick of time:The stories in Crane   s book are from the Grimms         Household Tales    so-called because they entertained and enlightened the family during time-consuming household labors.   Relayed by adults to adults and children, the tales sketch the characteristics of individuals and groups that are necessary for familial solidarity, an essential ingredient for survival at the time.  Several tales use one-dimensional characters to describe two sides of a single personality. The huntsman in Little Red-cap provides protection for the women while the wolf endangers their purity and their lives.   These characters depict the contradictory impulses of a single man, who protects the household but is subject to physical desires.     This model is repeated with pairs of kind and evil (step)mothers, as in Rapunzel and Cinderella.     The two tales Mother Hulda and The Three Little Men in the Wood describe the dichotomy of motivations for children.   These stories portray two children of polar opposites but can be used to help a child understand their own conduct, and for the health of the family, help to modify his or her behavior toward some middle ground.     We see in The Bird, the Mouse and the Sausage the necessity for the members of the household to contribute to the common effort based on their talents, and sketches the calamity that might arise from perceived inequities and inappropriate roles.   It can also be argued that the choice of non-humans as members of the household was intended to facilitate discussion among family members whose talents do not follow the stereotypical gender roles.   Tales like The Bremen Town Musicians stress the value of synergy of multiple strengths, while Cat and Mouse in Partnership warn against an unequal relationship.  Through the elemental parts, the complexity of personalities and collaboration are explained. Thus, one purpose of the stories, told around the hearth, was to strengthen relationships and understand to enable the household to prosper against the vagaries of economics, environment and society.    ;Mark, thank you for submitting your essay.   I hope others provide feedback for you as well.As for structure, this is well written with good form and style.    I'm not well-versed in this type of writing to know if a question can serve as a thesis or not, and would like others to weigh in on that.   That said, the question the power of choice calls to mind the question of free will and worthy of discussion.Adequate evidence is provided in the argument.   However, I would like to know more about ending an essay with a question as well.   I like to raise questions myself but am just wondering whether it is appropriate for this format of writing.Well done.;"

I have enjoyed reading everyone's essays here and have found them and the responses to my writing instructional.   I hope that I was able to incorporate ideas for improving essays into the one I wrote on Alice in Wonderland, which I have already submitted!   A little gun shy about missing the deadline again.Thanks again!;Victor,Thank you for submitting your essay in this forum, especially since it helped me see something about the gosling's tale that I had not seen before.   I have been very interested in the bilateral symmetry of images, such as the light/dark symbols that you mention, but I had not thought of the digestive/sexual dichotomy before, even though some had referred to the cutting of the goslings from the wolf's belly as a rebirth, your explanation makes that more clear to me.If your essay were to be improved, it would be through using paragraphs and white space to help the reader navigate the writing.   Practically all writing we do in the context of this course is persuasive writing - we are trying to persuade the reader to engage with the ideas, but first we have to get the reader to read.   The first view of the writing is how it appears on the page, and by making the image of the words on the page welcoming is the first step in capturing the reader's attention.   Very nice work, and I hope to see more of your ideas in the course.Cheers!;Karin,   Thanks for submitting your ideas.   I agree with Kathy that for this to be marked well as an essay, closer attention needs to be paid to the sentence structure and spelling.It was interesting, though, to look at the tales as a whole.   There are several points in your writing that could be developed into a short essay, especially the power and purpose of the oral tradition.   On the other hand, the assignments are short and must be focused.   I think it is hard for many of us as writers of longer pieces and used to looking at the big picture to write such brief, concentrated works.Strong ideas, Karin, and thanks for submitting your work in this forum.Cheers!;Connie,Thanks for submitting your essay in this forum.   You make a good point that using animals in the tales helps explain the lessons in an objective way.   This sort of storytelling is common and we are still taught as teachers to distance ourselves from the student and focus on the work to help relay a message in an objective, non-threatening way.   You provide evidence for your thesis by focusing on two stories and their lessons.   I appreciated your take on those two stories.If the essay were to be improved, I would recommend a close proof-reading of the essay, possible enlisting the help of a friend.   The well-considered ideas expressed can be strengthened by tightening up the grammar and style.Nice work.Cheers!;Kathryn, A well-written essay that describes a specific symbol from the stories - the forest - and the role it plays in children's lives.   Specifically the move from the safety of childhood and home and the passage to adulthood where they must forge on their own.If the essay were to be improved, it might be to make a closer analogy of the creatures and dangers of the forest to the hazards that the children will face as they grow up.   What do the creatures represent, both the kind and the not so kind?   For a short essay like this, specificity is important.Thanks for sharing your essay.   The ideas you used here are very similar to those I used when writing about Alice, only in her case I talked about her moving from childhood's self-centeredness to being more aware of the perspectives of others after her journey.Cheers!;Alice is a deconstructionist at heart. As are most children.   I haven't outgrown my own joy of wordplay (much to the chagrin of my colleagues, friends and family).   ;I agree with Goldy.   As someone else has said in the forum, seeing the movies or listening to an audible version of Alice makes it difficult to understand all the word play.   I would suspect that someone for which English is not their first language would also struggle with the wordplay.   Another barrier to enjoying the books are the references that are specific to Victorian England, Oxford and even the Liddell family.   Having read other Victorian literature has helped, but I still had to look up some ideas to help with the humor.I had never really enjoyed the film versions of the books, but now that I have read them, thanks for the requirement for this course, I have a lot more appreciation for the writing.   A last recommendation for getting more from the books is to remember the intended audience - children, specifically girls. I think about current books for children, especially something like Captain Underpants, which is intended for young boys, and while I don't personally appreciate the scatological humor in the book, I can understand how a young boy would enjoy it.   A problem, though, is that the references in Alice are too specific to the time to be totally enjoyable to a child of today, but keeping that perspective is helpful in enjoying the books for what they are.;I second the recommendation of the Phantom Tollbooth.   One of my favorites and a perennial read for me.;I have always been aware of the overt references to Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass, but now having read the books for the first time I am amazed at the more implicit ones.   It is amazing how this unassuming mathematics lecturer, Dodgson, has made such a significant impact on the literature and culture of the English-speaking world.   Questions:   Does that impact exist in countries where other languages dominate?How pervasive is the influence on current pop culture?;"

For instance, some read the annotated Alice and others did not, and so information from Gardner's annotations was not common knowledge.   The same can be said for any background information, for example, the biographical information in the anthologies I am taking some of the reading from.Also, citations and references are two different things.   Citations are what are done in the text (i.e., (Grimm 22)) and references are what are listed on the Works Cited page of a document or in the box we are given for works cited.   The quote that Joshua gives says that the contents of the common knowledge of the course does not require citations, but it does NOT say that it does not require references.   It is good practice to learn what much be cited and what doesn't in the context of the specific audience, but personally to err on the side of over-citation.   In my case, when I am reading another's essay, if there is something that I don't remember from the reading, the in-text citation gives me the ability to find the reference for myself if needed for further understanding.   ;I like your analogy as well and have thought about it often.   As a mathematics professor (who also teaches some art) I think that students should be able to transfer their knowledge of how to structure a mathematical argument to other disciplines, but it is harder for them to do than I imagined.   Realizing that an argument in literature is not as cut and dried as some mathematical proofs, I still wish I could teach them to use what they know from math in my art classes whether they are justifying the meaning their work.;Laura, I have seen quotes around single words in many of the essays I have read.   I agree that they are not needed.   Martha Ellen;Three sisters - again.   It seems to be a common thread in our reading.;I realize that Dr. Rabkin said  ""In our community, the readings, my videos, and your postings may be considered ""common knowledge."" Their contents do not require citation in this course.""However, there is a difference between in-text citations and references.   I recognize that for a specific audience you must assume a specific knowledge base.   For example, in my field I would never cite the quadratic formula because it is common knowledge in mathematics.   Dr. Rabkin provides us with very specific content for what our community considered common knowledge.But providing a specific reference to the work that was read for the essays is important.   We are not all reading the same edition:   some read the annotated Alice and some did not, not all translations of the Grimms' tales were the same, etc.   Stating in the Works Cited the specific edition that was read as the reference used, even when implicit citations are used, is important, both for clarifying the source but also for giving credit to annotators and translators for their intellectual property.Furthermore, the annotations, biographical information, footnotes, etc., that are particular to each edition is not common reading.   If information is taken from those sources, they need to have in-text citations.Dr. Rabkin did not give us free license to ignore citations altogether.   And using both in-text citations plus the references on the Works Cited are both important.Sorry about coming off sternly, but as an educator, I find that students find providing appropriate credit to the intellectual property of others very difficult.   This is precisely that type of course where this should be practiced to improve that ability.;Some people have worried about the in-text citation from eating up their word count and were choosing not to use them for the recommended edition, but I don't see any problems with using in-text citations for the book everyone is reading.   I also don't see any problem with being a little over the word count if there are in-text citations knowing that is where the extra is.;This is an example of an MLA in-text citation.   It is placed in the document where the intellectual property of someone else is used.The references are the works that are cited from and appear on the Works Cited page.   ;I only used MLA in the example I gave because that is what was handy for me.   I was just trying to distinguish between in-text citations and references.   While all documentation styles do each differently, all documentation styles have both.;The biggest issue is giving credit to others for their intellectual property.   It may be too much to ask for in this class for everyone to use a specific format, especially when there hasn't been intentional instruction as to what the format is.   Since the grading is left to peer review, and we all come from different backgrounds, it is impossible to assume that we will all use a single format.   I expect this to get very contentious as we go along, but am curious about how it all works as an educator who teaches on-line courses myself and would like to use peer review.I also assume that citations are required, not just for quotes but for any information taken from another author.   In my own classes, if a student does not cite others work then our institution's policy is that I can fail the student for plagiarism.   I wouldn't do so if it is a teachable moment and if the student's writing did not claim the information as his or her own and learned from that point for the future.However, in this class there is an assumption stated by Dr. Rabkin on what is common knowledge.   Therein lies the rub.   How do we interpret this?;I'm in both.   The reading for Relationships is taking longer than this one.   But I find Dr. Rabkin's lectures more interesting.   We will be looking at other relationships.   Kafka's include a working relationship, and The Ice Palace is a relationship between children, and possibly children and their parents.   I keep comparing the readings of the two courses and feel I am able to take what I learn from one and apply it to the other.  ;"

Even though Walton wrote that there had been a figure on the ice before Frankenstein showed up, I put that down to mirage or to seeing Frankenstein twice with some optical distortion the first time.   It almost seemed that Frankenstein let Justine die because he couldn't tell about the monster because in his subconscious he knew the monster did not really exist.The nested narration, that the creature never had its own name, and that the creature became so well-read and well-spoken all led me to this conclusion.   In a way, I thought about this like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde - that in Frankenstein's experiments he caused his psyche to split into the creature and a shell.   The creature was able to feel much more than Frankenstein could, but that it wasn't his appearance that drove people off, but rather the depth to which he felt was too much for other people.

The main points missed by most people about peer evaluation is what they should be getting out of it by doing it.   By reading other essays, we get to see others' arguments.   I find that reading essays are more useful to me than many of the forums because someone had to distill an argument down to 320 words or less, and so the writing is potent.But the peer reviewing itself is a critical thinking exercise - practice in following an argument, trying to think of counterexamples, etc.   And then there is the practice is writing constructive criticism.   I don't know if it is the luck of the draw, the reduced number of people actively engaged in the course over time, or that people are getting better at reviewing, but the reviews I have gotten from others have improved significantly since the beginning.   The criticisms I got the last two times have been useful to me.   Also the number of reviews I have gotten have increased (first 3, then 4 and finally 5).   I'm eager to see how good the critiques will become.;As pointed out on another thread, the scores are medians, not means.

To get a 2.5 there were an even number of scores and half were 2s and half were 3s (e.g., 2, 2, 3, 3).So... my point is that we can't tell from getting 2s whether someone gave us some 3s or not.   It also means we don't know if we got 1s or not.Note that 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 would result in a 3.   :);Maybe rose colored drinks?;I've been publishing my essays, in some form or another and with additional information, on my blog, scheduled to be published after the evaluations are over:   http://murphyslaw58.blogspot.com/Thanks to everyone who gave their blog address above.

Any thoughts of the connection between folklore and Hawthorne's story?;From the Work Expectations page a 2 is a pass.   You would have to be getting 1 (1 + 0) or less for a fail.   Also, only the highest 7 grades count.   (Which makes me feel less upset about missing the first assignment because I misread the deadline.)If you accumulate six or fewer submissions, regardless of the grades you received, you will not have earned a Statement of Accomplishment.   If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment.   If, though, five average 2 and two average 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.7 and will not have earned your Statement of Accomplishment.   However, you have ten opportunities to submit your work and only the seven highest submissions contribute to your average.   Therefore, if your essay grades fall down a bit, don   t worry; just try your best on the next week   s work.   If you achieve six essays averaging 2 on Form and Content and at least one more essay, even if that takes you ten weeks to accomplish, you truly will have earned your Statement of Accomplishment because, through that process, you will have learned much yourself and contributed much to the learning of others.   That is an accomplishment of which you can feel proud.;One thing this course does not have is a way to improve writing by getting feedback on rough drafts of the writing.   I for one would like to do this.   How?   I suspect people aren't willing to post their essays before the deadline - it would be a way for someone to simply copy the essay into their own assignment page - what is the likelihood that at random the person who originally wrote the essay would see it in the feedback stage or that one person would get two identical essays to grade?So, again, how?;I like the analysis of voice, and I didn't research enough to know that the ""pen name"" was related to Hawthorne's name.   Well written and I learned something.   Reading this and knowing what my thoughts were during the reading (I focused on word usage and common images), how complex literary analysis is.   It is difficult to be able to analyze a piece from many different angles at one time.   That is what makes taking a course like and reading others essays so enriching.Thanks for sharing.;I only got Hawthorne essays as well.   It seems that The Birthmark struck a cord in many people and that is what they wanted to write about.;Some of the essays that I have read in this course appear to be summaries of journal articles or websites that are only tangentially related to the readings.   Several times the essays have had no references to the readings that were required at all.   This makes me wonder whether the author of those essays did the reading or not.;"

I started with the first sentence and listed which website it came from.   Kept doing that until I was at the end of the second paragraph and then stopped.It might not have been so obvious, but in an effort to ""paraphrase"" the author of the essay mangled the grammar.   Only one of the references from Poe and Hawthorne's stories was from the assigned list (because the websites stolen from did not refer to them).   The flow of the essay was poor.  The person went to a lot of trouble to make an essay like a Frankenstein's monster out of parts of on-line summaries and analyses.   I think they spent their time doing that rather than reading the short stories.;I didn't do any research on Poe's life, so this told me something I didn't know already.   I'm curious though what work that information was taken from.   Was it in ""The Portable Poe?""   I read my stories out of 'The Complete..."" since that is what was in my library.   ;Thanks, Anon, for sharing.   I always find it interesting that we all focus on different images in the stories.   While I thought about the cat being a catalyst, I hadn't thought about the symbolism in as much depth as you were able to.;Efthymia, Thanks for sharing your essay.   I agree that Peer 3's statement about quotations is a little strong, but Peer 4 says the quotes were appropriate, and so I think you can allow those two comments to average out.   I particularly liked the statement that Aylmer considered Nature as a female character and to be controlled.   This is quite fitting with the Victorian sensibilities of the time and make it clear that his wife personifies Nature.;Amusing!   Very nice job with the rhyming - some small meter problems I think (without referring back to Poe).   I like the thesis with the reference to the Forbidden Fruit and the price to be paid for obtaining it - in Poe's case death to the object who inspired the quest for knowledge, Georgianna and the portrait painter's wife.Thanks for sharing.;Both Poe and Hawthorne write about psychological fixations, such as an irrational fixation on a birthmark, a black cat or a cloudy eye.   Writing in the 19th Century, neither would know of the term ""psychological fixation"" since the it was developed by Freud circa 1905 (Etymology).   These authors used the concept of fixation in ways that the world did not even have terminology for yet.As Dr. Rabkin presents etymology to deepen our understanding of the literature, I want to look at both the origins and subsequent uses of the term    fixation    as it relates to the literature of Poe and Hawthorne.   Appropriate to the mysticism of these authors    writing, the word comes from alchemy in the 14th Century (Etymology).   But more interesting are its subsequent uses in science after the authors' deaths.Fixation in histology is a process by which biological tissues are prevented decay, therefore preventing putrefaction.   It terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions and may also increase the mechanical strength or stability of treated tissues (Wikipedia).   Thus, the mesmerism used on M. Valdemar that  prevented decay and stabilized his condition was a histological fixation.Carbon fixation, another biochemical process usually driven by photosynthesis, is a process whether carbon dioxide is converted into organic compounds (Wikipedia).   We can imagine the mix of alchemy and photosynthesis at work in Rappiccini   s garden, and so that too is a type of fixation.In reading  we use visual fixation as we scan from word to word on the page.   In The Oval Portrait, the traveler has a visual fixation on the face of the woman that died and the words in the book that describes her marriage.  When I decided to look at fixation I thought I would have to struggle to make connections, but now it seems to be so central to the writing of Poe and Hawthorne, almost as if they invented the concept.   Thank you for fixating on my words for a short time.Thank you to the peer reviewers for your advice!Form:   3peer 1      This was a well-written essay, although I had a few little quibbles about the use of personal pronouns throughout it.peer 2      A very fixed spelling and grammar.peer 3      Well-written essay, with correct structure, grammar and spelling throughout. The argument is correctly presented in the proper format of argument > references > conclusion.peer 4      Your sentence structure and word usage is very good. The layout is also very good and the argument is very clear. ""These authors's,"" should be These authors'   (MEWaggoner note:   I repaired this error above.)peer 5      Essay is nicely written and easy to follow but it lacks title and the citations aren't used as I think they should be, but never mind that.Content: 2  peer 1      I feel you didn't attack the particular stories well enough. As such, the essay comes across as being quite vague. Having some relevant quotes would have added a lot to the essay.peer 2      Fixtalitious.peer 3      Interesting and informational essay! I enjoyed the explanations and references used, and it's one of the few essays I've read where I actually learned something new.peer 4      Your argument does makes sense and is persuasive. That is a good insight, that all these stories are connected by the theme of fixation, it is not as obvious in some stories as in The Birthmark. Very clever conclusion,peer 5      Idea is well presented but I think it would benefit from some clarification and/ or simplification in order to fully understand writer's intent. While I see the use of fixation in Poe's and Hawthorne's work, I can't really say to see those ""central connections"" writer suggests are there.Other comments:peer 1      Well done and enjoy 'fixating' on Wells.peer 3      My only extra comment is that I would be very, very cautious about breaking the Fourth Wall, as you did in the final sentence of your essay, as it pulled me right out of my immersion in the reading (which usually is the intent when a writer or actor breaks the Fourth Wall, but it felt out of place and invasive here). Otherwise well done!peer 4      Very good, well thought out.peer 5      Nice work, keep it up, but try to be more clear in presenting your idea.MEWaggoner's response:   First person singular:   I usually don't use first person in the essays but decided on that style this time.   It was a conscious choice specifically so I could break the Fourth Wall.Titles:   The majority of essays I have read did not have titles - I'm assuming to stay within the word count - not sure what I think about that issue in general.Supporting evidence:   I could have included more examples from more stories from our reading list, I recall from previous posts in the forums that 2 examples were sufficient and I provided 6 if you count the three I list in the first sentence (The Birthmark, The Black Cat and The Tell-Tale Heart, 2 from Poe and 1 from Hawthorne.)Quotations from the text:   Are they required or is referring to the narrative indirectly sufficient?   In my own grading I have not required quotes.;Javier, It is exciting to meet a peer reviewer!   Don't worry about the brevity of your comments in the review.   Of five reviewers there seems to be plenty of feedback each time.I was focusing on the use of the term rather than the concept, but I might not have made that clear (it was what I hoped I was saying when I referred to etymology and the previous and subsequent uses of the term fixation in relation to the time of Poe and Hawthorne).   According to the Online Etymology Dictionary:fixation (n.)  late 14c.,  fixacion, an alchemical word, from Medieval Latin  fixationem  (nominative  fixatio), noun of action from past participle stem of Latin  fixare, frequentative of  figere  ""to fix"" (see  fix  (v.)). Used in the Freudian sense since 1910.fixate (v.)  1885, ""to fix, make stable,"" from  fix  (v.) +  -ate. Meaning ""to gaze upon"" is from 1889. Psychological sense is from 1926, originally in Freudian theory, in this case perhaps a back-formation from  fixation. Related:  Fixated;  fixating.So even though Freud might have used the term more specifically as in anal or oral fixations, the use as a psychological term, rather than an alchemical term, was not in use until after Freud began using it (actually in 1905 according to another source I read.)   According to the second entry, the meaning of fixate as ""to gaze upon"" was not in use until 1889, also after Poe and Hawthorne.   Yes, the idea of fixating on an object (either visual or  psychological)   existed before Poe and Hawthorne, but the word fixate or fixation was not in use in that way until after both of these authors' deaths.   I would have liked to have included this level of detail in the essay, but have been striving to stay within the 320 word limit.Thanks for your expanded feedback.;Sean, Thanks for your feedback.Since the origins of the word fixation are from the Latin fixar = to fix, and that predated Poe and Hawthorne in that usage.   And so it would have been possible for either to use the word in that way.   I counted 13 uses of ""fixed"" or ""fixedly"" in  Old Manse and 12 uses in  The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, volumes 1 and 2, but neither author used fixation in those books.   I didn't refer to a book on scientific etymology, but suspect that histological fixation was termed later even though the concept fits Poe's mesmerism experiment.Alas, I didn't have time to finish ""Artist of the Beautiful"" and so missed that reference.   I'll have to finish it now.;Again, focusing on the word origins and not the concepts themselves, from the Online Etymology Dictionary:histology (n.)  ""study of organic tissues,"" 1847, from  histo-  +  -ology.;Florencia, thank you for your encouraging words.   Best wishes.;Thanks for introducing me to ""Women in Refrigerators.""   I might have to write sometime about the relationship between it and ""The Madwoman in the Attic.""   Having just ""discovered"" and started reading graphic novels, I will have to check out the website you cited.   Very nicely done.;Wide Sargasso Sea is on my reading list! - but alas, is a little far down in the queue.   First there is the reading for two MOOCs, then two books written by friends that need reviews done, then reading for course prep for fall, ...   Thanks for the recommendation.;Given that our ""grade"" is best on the 7 best grades out of 10, I am happy to see some creative efforts, especially when they might be graded lower by peer reviewers expecting the traditional essay.I was wondering in ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" if the perpetrator of the crimes were required, by social conventions of the time - much like our movie codes of the past century, to be caught.   Did Poe every write about a killer that got away?Thanks for sharing.   I enjoyed it.;Thanks for sharing.   You asked about grammar errors.   Here's what I've got.Maybe the peer reviewer doesn't not understand the use of ""suspect"" as an adjective.    You have used it correctly in the first sentence, but it is an uncommon use that some might have be familiar with.Some people might consider the appositive     The Artist of the Beautiful    in the third paragraph nonessential and, thus, should be offset with commas.   However, it is essential to describe which story you are referring to and having no commas is appropriate.In the last paragraph, the phrase following the semicolon is not a complete sentence, and so a comma would have been appropriate.   But, frankly, I had to really dig for the third point.   On my first reading I didn't notice anything amiss and actually quite enjoyed the essay.;I chose Wikipedia instead of the scientific texts in my roommate's office, which I also consulted, because it was easy reference for a general audience, such as our peer reviewers in this course.   There is some historical taboo about using Wikipedia that I don't understand.   It is a good source of references to scientific and other resources and is fine for a starting place for research.   If information is substantiated in other sources, any source it comes from is legitimate, regardless of the perceived authority of the source.These facts, which were not random in the scientific sense at all and if you are studying science I am surprised you used the term incorrectly, but were related by a common etymology, precisely the subject that Dr. Rabkin is teaching us to appreciate.What novels are you referring to?   ;I see.   In this unit we read short stories instead of novels - that was my confusion.   Also, random is a scientific term that means there is no pattern and no connection.   It is often used colloquially as a replacement for the term non sequitur, i.e., to mean something unrelated to the current topic of conversation.   As a scientist myself, I prefer to avoid the colloquial use.I wonder also if the fact that English is not your first language, Anon, makes the difference in the use of the scientific term ""fixation"".   Maybe in the translation (or back translation if the term originated in another language other than English) the scientific term fixation is not the same in each separate discipline, which could explain why you think it is not used much in science.    I just did a brief quiz of my scientifically minded friends on Facebook, and so far they have replied that they frequently use the term fixation in psychology and the medical field.   In the latter, there is a ""fixation of the bowel"".   I didn't know about that term at the time I wrote the essay and wish I had to try to fit it in somewhere.Thanks for clarifying some confusing points I had with your comment.   While I disagree with you that I over-stretched the idea to fit the novels, I appreciate that you took the time to comment.;Sean, thanks for sharing.   Despite what the reviewers said, I learned something from your essay because I hadn't read Poe's biography.   I like that you pointed out the uses of phrases like ""once upon a time"" and ""a kingdom by the see"" and how they set the tone of the writing.   I am not yet to the point where I pick up on these cues readily, and it was valuable for those to be reiterated for me.;"
FALSE,St341,Coh1,1,1,0,0.24,0.0483957,0.130503158,0.05,0.266666667,0.225,0.06142505,0.3012048,"Fiction, as a genre in literature, encompasses a large number of sub-genres, fantasy being one of those.  Fantasy:   ""is the forming of mental images with strange or other worldly settings or characters; fiction which invites suspension of reality.""Fiction: ""can be defined as narrative literary works whose content is produced by the imagination and is not necessarily based on fact. In fiction something is feigned, invented, or imagined; a made-up story.""Source (with other definitions of genres):  http://genresofliterature.com/;Many good answers here.It's useful to conceive of any genre simply as a set of expectations. Broadly, all fiction involves fantasy in the sense of imagining what a character might say in some situation, or conceiving of what another character might do in some given context. But that conception of fantasy has more to do with reader reception, or perhaps, too, with authorial concerns, rather than specific kinds of subject matter.But when a friend says to you, ""Hey, let's go see a horror movie,"" your reaction will be informed by the set of expectations that come to mind. And these expectations are rather finely calibrated. Most people will fairly instantly understand the differences in their own expectations between a ""teen-horror flick"" -- transgressive sex, incidental cruelty, a cabin in the woods, punishment of both of these things by an indestructible monster with a horrible past and terrible disfigurement -- and, say, a ""psychological horror film"" -- a vulnerable protag with reason to doubt his own perceptions, a loving partner who only wants to help, a series of dark twists and shocking losses that drive toward the revelation that, oops, the loving partner's not so loving after all. There are many variations on the theme, sure, but only a few key categorical identifiers will signal lists of expected characters and plot points, along with a number of notable titles to be called into comparison.You'll know what to expect from a western, or a romance, or a family drama, and those expectations might extend beyond plot and character to tone, style, and even, sometimes, running time. When I think of fantasy, I'll probably immediately call Tolkien to mind, though others will think of George R. R. Martin. These authors both might have had different ideas about how fantasy can and should go -- there's wiggle room -- but the ways in which those authors' stories are similar probably do more to gauge audience expectations than the places in which they're different. We know, too, what we're getting into with sci-fi, for the most part, and sub-genres abound.For me, though, genre can be tricky, because it is a set of expectations based on easily identifiable signifiers. Genre can be so knee-jerk, in fact, that it can be entirely misleading, and so it's useful to keep historical and cultural context in mind. Some might think of  Twilight, for example, as a class of horror fiction, because of its engagement with vampire tropes, but for me it's a fantasy story that has far more to do with elves than vampires. That assertion might seem odd at first, but No  l Carroll, who writes about the horror genre, says in his essay, ""The Nature of Horror,"" that in order for a monster to be classified as belonging to the art-horror genre, it must be both threatening and impure. Carroll identifies impurity, if I remember correctly, as engendering in the positive protagonist a fundamental response of revulsion -- a desire not to be touched by the monster. The vampires in  Twilight can be suitably threatening (given the target audience), but they're seldom impure. Most of them are actually pretty cool, if not actually sexy, and given that significant portions of the story are set in the woods, where creatures who glow indulge their otherworldly powers, it becomes almost difficult not to expect Legolas to show up, bow in hand.Anyway, I hope that makes some sense. All the best.;There's another interesting aspect to Twilight that many people don't realize - Fifty Shades of Grey, published as a novel in its own right, began life as a Twilight fanfiction. There are some moral/ethical issues there, if not copyright ones, but it's a compelling discussion to delve into for anyone who is so inclined; we are, of course, all entitled to ""play"" in other authors' worlds (fanfiction has existed in one form or another as long as fiction itself has), but at what point does that play encroach on the original author's space? If Twilight is fantasy and Fifty Shades of Grey is romance, and Fifty Shades of Grey is a dressed up Twilight fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off, then does that make *Twilight* more romance than fantasy? The whole controversy demonstrates how malleable and arbitrary such labels can be.... yet no author can be published without knowing what labels fit their work (and which labels will work to sell books).That leads to a final interesting question - if genre labels are more of a simple selling tool than an accurate way to categorize books, then should we, as readers, pay attention to them at all?These questions are all debatable, by the way. I'd be happy to see discussion from anyone who doesn't think Twilight is fantasy, thinks that Fifty Shades of Grey is not at all overstepping authorial bounds, thinks genre labels are a distinct and vital tool, etc.;This was a discussion that a few friends of mine had.   Here's some responses ...I know, and the Science Fantasy category doesn't even include Star Wars, arguably the most well-known science fantasy of them all. In truth, you could argue that most science fiction is in fact science fantasy, and many bookstores include science fiction in the fantasy section. But in defense of Jane, she did specify books, not movies.Also, many of these categories bleed into each other. Harry Potter, for instance, is both Contemporary Fantasy and High Fantasy.Other examples of science fantasy:the John Carter seriesTerry Brooks' ShannaraDragon Ball ZMore Low Fantasy:Conan  The Green MilePreacher (wow, a map based on Preacher? Sign me up!)A Song of Fire and Ice is actually High Fantasy, not Low Fantasy. It has dragons and supernatural entities, for one thing. Low fantasy is primarily set in the ""real world,"" whatever that entails, while high fantasy takes place in a completely fictional world with its own laws of physics.Other high fantasy works:The Northern LightsThe Chronicles of NarniaDungeons and DragonsWheel of TimeDiscworldThe Dark Tower (elements of the supernatural, magic)Harry Potter (yes, it takes place in the contemporary world, but most of the action takes place in the wizarding world, which is definitely High Fantasy - wizards, dragons, mythological beasts, etc.)Alice in WonderlandMalazanThe Black Company (yes, it's dark, but it's in a different world with its own rules)For Contemporary Fantasy, you could have things likeThe Dresden FilesFablesThor (high fantasy as well)Hellboy (as Lovecraftian as comics get, so dark fantasy, too)Preacher (again!)Harry Potter (fits here, too)Lewis' That Hideous StrengthMary Poppins (hah!)His Dark Materials (again)more Dark Fantasy:The Dark Towerthe Elric booksThe Black CompanySo don't despair! High Fantasy is a broad enough category to contain many different types of maps....historical fantasy is my choice! whether in the realms of king arthur, norse gods, the pharaohs or something completely different, there is plenty of fertile ground for the imagination to bring forth a truly original work....Funny how different people use the same terms different ways. I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek, but I would call it ""hard"" sci-fi. Star Wars, with its mystical ""Force"" seems a little softer, leaning to science fantasy. (The Force was mystical to me in the original trilogy. I have heard indirectly that other stories have tried to give it more of a scientific basis, but I don't have anything first-hand on that.)...Science fiction is fantasy. We cannot travel at warp speed to distant planets. No one can carry around a light sword, who would not like a robot to do the house hold chores or to play with the kids. These three are science fiction, but also fantasy when played in the imagination of a 10 year old. Whilst science fiction and fantasy can be classed as two different things (sci-fi based on the plausable) you have a genre of fantasy call science fantasy. Stories that contain a mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. Trek and Wars belong in this category. Where does Avatar fit into the definition? Science fiction elements include the futuristic part, giant machines, space travel and Aliens. The fantasy part comes from the aliens though. They have no science. At the end of the film one character transforms from human to Na   vi, moves from the world of science fiction to that of fantasy.    Popular sicence fantasy include:Star Wars, Dune, The Golden Compass, The Gods of Mars, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy....I would not say there is science fact in Star Trek[Answered by]Hypospray - Injectors like this have been in use for many years.Personal communicators - who does not have a mobile telephone today?Phasers - wicked lasers spider 3 is the closest today    Universal Translator - these are now around.

It had to diagnose 10 different things.[[Answered by]Ah, but none of these things existed when Star Trek was created by Gene Roddenberry in the mid 1960's. In my mind, it is science fiction if plausible technological advancements could bring about the essential elements of the story, so clearly Star Trek falls into that category. You are almost making my point for me. But the human brain will never be a source of telekinetic power, so the Force remains fantasy. (Inb4 someone says Star Wars does not portray humans, but humanoids who lived ""long ago in a galaxy far far away"".)In my mind, science fiction is not fantasy. If it is supernatural, it is fantasy. If it might be natural, but we don't yet have the skills or evidence, then it can be science fiction. There is perhaps a spectrum between these two concepts: after all, Clarke's Third Law of Prediction is ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""Now you have me thinking about what distinguishes science fiction from ""mainstream"" fiction. In some ways, the ""CSI"" TV series are just barely science fiction in my mind, because what they do could be possible, but in reality, you do not get DNA results overnight. (But someday, perhaps we will.) And what about a novel like Harry Turtledove's ""Supervolcano: Eruption""? It describes an eruption in Yellowstone Park, the likes of which has not been seen in over 600,000 years, but which geologists recognize as a real possibility. But we don't know precisely what the effects would be, so it is speculative fiction (another term occasionally used instead of science fiction)....Science fiction is like pornography. You may not be able to describe it, but you know it when you see it.    This is the problem with polls that I think we can all agree on, no matter how it it worded or how many different subjects we place on them, people around the world will always have different definitions for them. When we start to draw this, a lot of leeway can be given to the artist to come up with something new....I chose contemporary fantasy ... partly because no-one else seems to be talking about it, partly because I had to look it up to properly understand it, partly because Artemis Fowl is one of my all time favourite stories, partly because of the cross-overs with other things (like 666 Park Ave, Under the Mountain, Lovecraft, The Man in Yellow and a  gazillion  other things) and partly because I like forging new roads rather than arguing old stuff!...Science fantasy was a toss up between A wrinkle in the skin and Starship Troopers. Both are fantastic books and probably rank in my best books of all time list.[John Christopher: A wrinkle in the Skin, Robert Heinlein: Starship Troopers]...Historical Fantasy.I suppose it's premature to speak of specific concepts, but I'm having an idea.

I am not very surprised that they would consider these to be errors. After all in the UK we aren't taught American English so I don't suppose that Americans are taught British English.  I don't think we should consider one English as being any more 'real' than another. After all Americans use much older English words than the British, words that they took with them from England that have now changed in British English.  On a worldwide basis we have to accept that American English has become much more prevalent. The film industry and the growth of the internet has spread American English far more widely than British English. I teach English to business men and women world wide. If there is an American equivalent of a British word I teach both. People who work internationally are more likely to encounter American than British English particularity if working with oriental Asia, a high growth area.The English language, wherever it is spoken, changes frequently. New words are added and words change meaning. We no longer speak the same language as Shakespeare. Some grammar rules have changed as you can see in reading these Victorian novels.Anyway, I am rambling on.

Difficulty in categorizing it is part of the reason I haven't got it into print yet... I've had publishers call it ""general fiction,"" ""slice of life,"" and ""disability fiction."" All are applicable, but the first two are too broad to be considered ""marketable"" (you need a more specific target genre), and the third.... well, as proud as I am of being a writer with a disability who incorporates disability issues into my work, I'm slightly uncomfortable with the pigeonholing that ""disability fiction"" implies. None of my work has ever been *about* disability - if I've done my job well, it's good fiction that incorporates characters who happen to be disabled as regular people. And the term ""disability fiction,"" or ""crip lit,"" as disabled writers irreverently call it, hasn't been around long enough for the average reader to grab hold of that idea... ablebodied people see the label ""disability fiction"" and think it's going to be a work *about* disability, instead of a work where disabled characters go about their daily lives (or solve mysteries, or fight aliens, or whatever... but at least in those cases, the writer has the option of the 'mystery' or 'sci fi' tag).Put another way, I don't take issue with the *term* ""disability fiction"" but I do take issue with the ""a very special episode!"", after school special, The More You Know connotations it realistically has for anyone not disabled.

That's not true of course - the worldbuilding involved in creating a solid fantasy world is just as intense, even if you're researching as a starting point and going from there.

I did not encounter any story focusing on sex.Although you may be right because after reading the ""The Rabbit's Bride""  I was thinking about more of pedophiles or people who abduct women for their own pleasure. I did not get simillar thought with other stories.For the fox meaning I found only this for now:""In pre-Christian Times the fox was seen as a symbol of gods, like for example, as a symbol of the god of vegetation or as a symbol of forest- and mountain-spirits. This changed in Christian Times, from where on the fox was seen as a demonic creature. The fox is a very famous figure in fables and usually is described as greedy, dishonest and tricky. At the same time of all the helpful animals in fairy tales the fox is said to be the most helpful one. Most fables tell about how the fox tricks other animals to get food, but no legends or fairy tales have been found telling about the fox attacking humans.""http://www.wsl.ch/land/products/predator/paper2.htm;I think that we should find something that we perceive as important in the stories.

It has been made into a  dark, yet funny one, such as Roald Dahl   s rhyme    Little Red Riding Hood  and the Wolf   . There are the ones where Little Red Riding Hood is saved  from the wolf   s stomach by either a huntsman or her own father, like in  John B. Gruelle and the Lower Lusatia   s versions; or not eaten at all,  like in Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm   s story, ""Little Red Cap"", where the  girl goes    cheerfully home, and came to no harm   . And even the ones  where she escapes on her own, like in the French tale,    The  Grandmother,    where she flees to her own house. But there are also the  darker versions, where Little Red Riding Hood is not saved at all, and  she ends up being eaten by the wolf, like in Charles Perrault   s. Finally, some retellings may be darker by introducing supernatural  beings such as werewolves. They are a combination of human and beast;  they have their ambitions, intuitions, and senses. An example of this is  Angela Carter   s    The Company of Wolves   , where it could seem quite  obvious that the charming young man dressed as a hunter was the evil  creature, there is a predisposition to which the charming ones end up  being the wicked ones (take Wickham in Jane Austen   s Pride and Prejudice,  for example). But we do not expect his tenderness towards the girl, as     sweet and sound she sleeps in granny   s bed, between the paws of the  tender wolf    (220).

This! There's a tendency to try to categorise, but the very best fiction blurs and merges genres.One of my long-time favourites is Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series in which an exploratory space ship is sent out from modern day  to colonise a distant planet, crashes and is subsequently ""lost"".   Fast forward a couple of centuries, and the colony is thriving, feudalistic and with a system of magic using matrices  which they describe as ""science"" ...      This series uses the genre of  fantasy  to explore issues around science and technology, ethics, feminism, social interactions, evolution,  languages etc.   Quite a lot is drawn from fact, from the ""real world"",  and what is deemed fantastical shifts depending upon perspective and belief systems.Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, Peter Dickinson and the great Ursula Le Guin and Octavia Butler have all done this very effectively.I tend to assume that all utopian/dystopian fiction is fantasy, in that it imagines a society not yet built - though it may have its roots here and now - and which may also be sci-fi, depending on the way issues of technology are approached.  ;"

It did strike me as roll-your-eyes kind of funny that the idiot rabbit didn't even spot that his ""wife"" was a straw figure, a fake, the wrong one; a great many of the tales feature similar situations where the prince/male is completely fooled by sometimes highly transparent  transformations and disguises, and is unable to recognise his own wife.

I find it interesting to re-read certain tales such as Snow White with this in mind.;Some academics have also linked the use of the number 3 - in addition to the colours white, red and black, and the turn of the seasons  - to the Pagan traditions which invoke the Goddess as a trinity or triple aspect.

As for travelling during the day, I'm not sure what chapter, but Helsing also says something like, ""Contrary to popular belief, vampires can travel during the day""   He tells us that their powers are severely limited.   Stoker was taking oral folk tales and committing them to a text.   He kept what he wanted and tossed the rest, as other authors have continued to do with each new vampire story that comes out.;This novel was a Victorian novel.   Immigration to England and various parts of Western Europe was at an all time high, and one of the largest portions of immigrants were Eastern Europeans, gypsies and the likes.

Victorian novels always explore the dark side of Victorian life, and this is another way of showing their fear of what is not them--the immigrants, by making this part of the world uncivilized.;I think the homosexuality element is not present in Stoker's book, but later authors have played that up.   Specifically, Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire series.   In that book, clearly the relationship between Louis and Armand is very sexually charged, and the majority of vampires in the book are male.

My excitement has nothing to do with the grade I got. In fact, I got the same grade than last time. No, my excitement is due to my reviewer's dilegence when providing me with useful comments and ideas about how to improve my piece.This is truly   a breath of fresh air, since last time there were   lots of complains in the facebook group for   the   poor peer review taking place.It's not only the peer review that has gotten better, the essays   got were also a lot better than last time.I know it is too soon to tell, but I just hope to keep getting comments as well thought as I did this time.I want to thank my reviewers since their feedback will help me become a stronger writer and A better critical thinker.This is what my peers said about my essay:FORMpeer 1      Good form and vocabulary but some grammatical errors should be corrected and a bit more editing is needed. As examples:    When it comes to women    needs a comma after the phrase;    stereotypes: the good one and the bad one.    might be better said as simply    the good and the bad.    More editing is needed.peer 2      Great work on citing all the sources you used! A few things to note are comma and colon usage, word choice, and phrasing. I would suggest looking up comma usage in the MLA or APA handbook if you have them available. They are very useful in assisting writers in their own editing. Be cautious of word choice. Some of your sentences get a little lost due to words such as ""to be"" (is, are, was). Also, your phrasing in some of your sentences sounds a little off. A trick I use when writing is to read my sentences out loud. Most often, if they sound funny, they've been written funny. Going back and reediting your work several times is the best way to catch many of these little mistakes.peer 3      Your written English is fairly good, and you're able to convey your meaning most of the time. There is room for improvement, with sentences such as, ""the Grimms did not complicate themselves by given them too much thought."" Does this mean that the Grimms didn't create complex characters who were able to think deeply, or that the Grimms themselves didn't complicate their task by thinking deeply about the characters? Your sentence structures aren't always strong, though your spelling is excellent, and the essay is generally understandable. Your citation of Bruce's work is clear and well placed. The essay structure is weakened by a lack of focus. You cleverly give solid, concrete examples of behaviour that support your overall argument; yet they range across such a broad spectrum that it is hard to follow the thread of your argument. Given the word limit, it might help to pick out one strand of misogyny - beauty and gentleness OR passivity OR suffering, for example - so as to build a more focused argument.peer 4      The structure is good over all except for some grammatical mistakes, such as 'give' should be 'giving in second line, and some others. The division into three parts is good in keeping the detail of each part separate although the general theme runs through them (gender.)CONTENTpeer 1      I wonder if you proved your thesis on the characterization of the female. Your argument selects a number of good examples and does make a point. However, it was not the Grimm Brothers who were at fault for the stories' viewpoint. They were collectors and only wrote what was the prevailing attitude.peer 2      I totally agree with the misogynistic aspects of the Grimm's Brother's work. They don't really seem to cut women much of a break, do they? However, your essay lacks a full thesis statement. I get what you are trying to argue, but you never state you're arguing that the Brother's Grimm stories' were intentionally written to put women in their place. A strong and concise thesis statement might also give your essay a little more structure and direction.peer 3      The overall argument of misogyny in the tales is supported by excellent use of concrete examples of misogyny from specific stories. The weak structure of the essay makes it hard to follow the thread of the argument from beginning to end, though the basic idea of misogyny in the tales is clearly conveyed. I am unsure whether you mean to say that the Grimms themselves are the source of the misogyny within the stories, or that the stories reflect social standards of the time which go unchallenged by the Grimms, so being clear about this would be helpful. By focusing on one or two aspects of misogyny in the tales you would significantly strengthen your thesis.peer 4      The content is very good. For one I was not aware of that general theme until I read the essay (misogyny) The examples given from many essays are illuminating and they refer to the traditional gender roles prevalent in all cultures, old and new.COMMENTSpeer 1      Good job... Your essay did get me thinking and I was also struck by the way women were typed in these stories.peer 3      My hope is that you'll find these comments helpful rather than disheartening. You've clearly got strong ideas about the tales, and your essay has the potential to be really good with some polishing. I'd like to say that I was delighted and very amused by the sentence, ""This princess was beautiful and gentle and probably also mentally challenged"", which both pointed out the shallow characterisation of the princess and conveyed a wry humour about it.By the way,  I am still part of the facebook group from the   previous time which    has gotten bigger with new members taking the current iteration.

I like that Van Helsing is a thoughtful, intelligent protagonist, rather than a quixotic action hero that I assumed him to be. So many essay topics....... ;I agree. If my thesis was, ""the protagonist of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland isn't really named Alice,"" I could easily provide examples of times where she forgot who she was and times where she was referred to as ""a girl"" or other descriptive titles. Not only would you disagree with me, but my argument would be ignoring the many times she is specifically called Alice. It would take a compelling argument to make this thesis even debatable.On the other hand, I had a couple of essays that were completely incoherent and had no thesis at all. If someone has a poor thesis, but it is organized well and the author attempted a well-thought out argument, I give it a 2.;5.5 is an incredible score. Let me try and be critical so you can continue to improve. Form: Sentence structure good and thesis clear. Sentences flow well together. Here are some nits: Commas and periods should go inside the quotes.  ""Time works different[LY] for him..."" ""She is explained"" is improper word usage. It implies ""she"" is the one being explained. You could use ""she is told."" A comma is the wrong punctuation after ""cut afterwards."" Maybe an em-dash or colon? Content: Your thesis is strong and you did a nice job of citing examples to form your argument. Is it a mirror paradigm? Or perhaps she has learned from past experiences and is continuing her progression. There are many mirror elements in LGLand, but why is it the milieu that changes Alice's perception? ~ Critiques aside, I found this essay better than the ones I formally critiqued and would have given it 2+3, even though I am not fully convinced that the setting was tied to her shift in worldview.;Here's mine. Score is 2+2=4. I'm happy, but want to improve. A common theme in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass is the progression of childhood into adulthood, but the immaturity and irrationality of the adult figures show that Alice's vision of adulthood is often misleading. One of the best examples of Alice encountering immature adults is in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland during a tea party. The March Hare, the Hatter, and a dormouse are present and they contradict Alice with every remark to the point of absurdity. A tea party is often seen as a sophisticated pastime, but the three characters are juvenile in their behavior. The blending of the tea party with childish behaviors raises questions for Alice what it means to be an adult. Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated. The king tries to pacify her, but he too fails to exhibit adult-like behavior by giving illogical arguments in a court proceeding. Alice later realizes that the highest authorities in the land are nothing but a deck of cards. Through the Looking-Glass also demonstrates the irrationality of adulthood. One example of this is in the poem, ""Jabberwocky."" Carroll uses fictitious words to parody the contemporary poetry and intellectualism of the time. Only Humpty Dumpty, the modern intellectual of Alice's dream, has the capacity to understand the poem. Ironically, he is a nursery rhyme character and is foolish enough to sit on a wall that he knows he may fall from. Even intellectuals are depicted as childish without common sense. The juvenile renderings of the events and characters in Alice's dreams raise into question the meaning of adulthood. As much as these stories tell of a girl growing up, they show that adults regularly exhibit child-like behaviors. Works cited  Carroll, Lewis. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, New York: MacMillan. (1865) Carroll, Lewis. Through the Looking-Glass, New York: MacMillan. (1871) Form  peer 1     I like the structure of your essay. There is a clear introduction sentence in which you describe the topic analyzed, and your arguments are convincing and confirm your theory. The grammar is correct and the essay well-written.  peer 2     Form and structure are clear, but could be more sophisticated. It is not so clear, what really should be the point: Alices journey to adulthood? The immaturity of adults? The immaturity of adults as Alice dreams them up? Longer parts of the essay are just re-telling of the story. Since length of the essays are so severly limited, it would have been essential to more deeply develop the analysis than retell the story.  peer 3     The essay is well structured and effective. Nothing negative to say.  peer 4     Excellent writing and structure  peer 5     Well formed. If you use a quote from the book make sure you use quotation marks.  peer 6     Your form is very good. You explain much without seeming like you are hopping around. Content:  peer 1     Your essay exposes and develops a thesis, and successfully supports it with examples from different parts of the books. However, there are some fragments too descriptive, like this one:    Alice then travels to a garden where she encounters the queen playing a strange version of croquet. The queen is quick to throw a tantrum and flippantly orders for people to be decapitated.    We already knew it, so you could have focused into the lack of adult-like behavior displayed by the king and the whole court.  peer 2     The journey to adulthood is an important topic of Carroll's books, many essays point to this. I am not so convinced about the point of immaturity of adults (which is a bit unclear in itself). The depicted ""immaturity"" could also be read as a hint to Alice's immaturity (it is she, after all, who dreams up the story).  peer 3     You make an interesting observation of the meaning of adulthood from a child   s point of view, which is genuine and show critical thinking. Although you should go deeper into the subject, since you give the examples but you don   t really develop your thesis.  peer 4     Terrific thesis, supporting details and analysis from throughout the text!  peer 5     I'm not sure about your comment 'Alice's vision of adulthood is misleading'. Do you mean that she saw adults as logical until she entered wonderland where that premise is put into question? I'm not sure how true that is, I think she found adults dull but not necessarily logical, she didn't understand adults in the normal world either. I agree that Carrol brings into question the rigid division between adult and child.  peer 6     I like your concept of the stories, however I do disagree with you. I found that it was Alice that was immature, rude and argumentative. But alas, I'm not here to grade our difference of opinions but how well you performed your essay. I feel you did very well. ;There is definitely hidden meaning in the fact that Van Helsing and Seward keep the ""transfusions"" a secret.Another comment, perhaps unrelated, is that many people in the time period would die from blood transfusions. Do we really know that Lucy died from Dracula's poison? More specifically, did Dracula intend for her to turn so quickly? As a vampire, she is no longer a form of sustenance for him.;I didn't mind Atlas Shrugged, aside from the 60 page (!) speech proselytizing objectivism. The Fountainhead was much better. I have her book on writing fiction and if you thought her novel was heavy-handed, you would groan all the more at her approach to writing fiction. Even the buildings are purposeful in expressing her ideologies.;I think it all depends on what you want to accomplish with your writing. If you are creating an escapist adventure or good beach read, then perhaps symbolism plays a lesser role and deep critical analysis is less important. If your writing is meant to express your ideologies in a way that people can relate to, then it would be beneficial to understand how symbolism is woven into classic novels. My favorite author is Gene Wolfe and his writing has puzzles within puzzles, unreliable narrators, and several levels of symbolism. I enjoy rereading his work, each time peeling back another layer of the onion. I enjoy it and could only dream of replicating some of his best works. For other people, they enjoy the reading and writing experience for all together different reasons. There is no right answer.;I'm going to try and read everything (we'll see how long it lasts!). Dracula was tough to finish, but having already read Frankenstein, I may read more quickly through it this time.The books I'm most interested in are the more contemporary works, like Bradbury and LeGuin.;There's already a thread for this topic:https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=289;Interesting topic... I don't think the novel is meant to downplay either faith or science -- they work hand-in-hand. Lucy is rejuvinated by blood transfusions. The Christian objects seem to have their power in the objects themselves rather than in the faith in those using them. It is no mistake that they are Christian objects as vampires are the antithesis of Christianity (in their form of communion, getting power from darkness, drinking of blood, which has sexual connotations).Van Helsing is the one who tells Mina that her scar will only be temprorary -- I never thought of him as  a Father figure, but he would be the closest one to it.;I lucked out this time. All are pretty good, in sharp contrast to last time. No ones and a couple of threes coming. ;I was under the impression that the mad man (his name escapes me at the moment) invited Dracula into the home where Mina was staying rather then her initiating the invitation. ;My take -- It shows Lucy as a mother figure and sets up a social hierarchy. The three women with Dracula were not allowed to have Harker and settled for a child. I almost wonder if it is masoginistic in that the new women cannot achieve free reign even in their nonconformity to Victorian ideals. Not sure on this one... ;I've read  three or four  novellas by him and several short stories. I am Legend is probably my favorite. I absolutely loved the ending -- especially the last sentence. I have the Library of America's Classic SF Novels of the 50s collection (which includes The Shrinking Man) -- surprisingly, I haven't gotten around to reading that story yet.One of the most memorable Twilight Zone  episodes I remember (watching as a child) was Button Button -- one of his short stories. I didn't watch his Star Trek episodes, but surely plan on checking them out.He will be missed and many of his stories are still as relevant today as they were when he wrote them.;"

I had the advantage (?) of only getting three reviews, but after getting a 3.5 and a 4, I'll take it.In Bram Stoker's  Dracula, the communion wafer, or  host, is an anathema to the vampires' vitality. Despite being human, Mina screams when Van Helsing touches a host to her forehead. It ""burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal."" The remaining scar is an external sign of her exile from Victorian society into Dracula's caste and God's protection over her.Before commenting on the scar, it is important to consider the cause of it -- namely, the host. In Catholic tradition, the host is the transmuted body of Christ and by partaking of it, the believer shares in Christ's death and resurrection and thus shares in his eternal life. However, as the Apostle Paul notes, ""he that eateth ... unworthily, eateth ... damnation to himself."" The host has both healing and destructive properties and it is Mina's poisoned blood that causes the wound to form.  The scar forms a red circle on Mina's white forehead (a stain on pure skin), causing her to wail, ""Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!""  God's rejection of Mina parallels his rejection of Cain in  Genesis. After Cain spilled his brother's blood, he was was cursed from the earth and forced to live in exile. Cain realized his pending doom, so God placed a  mark  of protection over him.  The placing of the host on Mina serves as a protection from Dracula; however, the scar also marks her exile from Victorian society. When a neighbor woman sees her, she makes the sign of the cross to ward off Mina's  evil eye.Mina's scar also signifies her kinship with Dracula, who likewise bears a scar on his own forehead. As long as Dracula lives, Mina's scar remains a sign of their sinful union. Van Helsing promises Mina that it is only temporal and the scar and all that it represents will disappear when Dracula is killed.;Some other thoughts: ""He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion."" It seems Aylmer sees Georgiana more as a subject than a wife (albeit slightly).  Aylmer refers to his servant as a clod and earthly mass and in the end it is ""Mother Nature"" who gets the last laugh. I don't see this as much about pursuing perfection as I see it as a battle between a man's two loves, namely his wife and science. Of course, the pursuit of perfection is much of what science is about. ;First, on peer grading -- the most value is in the critiquing itself: learning how to analyze other essays critically while enhancing your own knowledge of the novel. Some people are less advanced and you can provide meaningful feedback. Others are more advanced and you can learn and give the best feedback you can. I'm not a professional reviewer or a teacher, but I try to give meaningful feedback (whether or not it is is debatable). But this process and the writing of the essay itself is where I progress the most. I like that the lectures are broken into segments so I can watch them throughout the week at my leisure. I think Professor Rabkin has many great insights and like all literary analysis, there always can be points of contention. He has a passion and knowledge of the subject matter that provide great value to the student. I feel no need to anonymously air my quibbles. But even with the great deal of complaining, I thoroughly enjoy the discussion boards. Without them there would be no way to ask questions. No way to interact. No way to have a class community. I am enjoying the class and am enthusiastic to progress to more modern texts like Bradbury, LeGuin, and Doctorow, where my greater interests lie. I was surprised how much I liked Dracula and even though I have read the other texts thus far, I have enjoyed digging deeper into them.

But I think that part of this is simply a cultural construct; we are so used to morality tales following the formula of ""righteous character is triumphant and succeeds, and wicked character gets just desserts"" that we have difficulty seeing the lesson in a tale that takes different forms. In the time that these tales developed, community was the fundamental rock of survival. The actions of one person could unravel the fabric of their society. Take for instance ""The Death of the Hen."" On the surface, this seems to be more a tale of   senseless injustice than a framework for right living. However, if we understand that it is meant more as a cautionary tale for lack of morality it makes a bit more sense. In a time when survival was often the only reward for being a morally upright person, this sort of tale would make far more sense to the average person than one of rags to riches; keep in mind that these were the tales of the common man, not the literati. Hence the name Hausm _rchen. With ""The Death of the Hen,"" the importance of honor and duty to community are emphasized. In addition, the interconnected of a community's members is also stressed. It is because the Hen, in her gluttony (a sin) breaks her oath, which in turn sets of a cascade of tragic events that ultimately destroys the community. We see this in the very delineated way in which the events progress, e.g., the Cock goes to the Brook to get some water for the choking hen, then goes to the Bride to get some silk, then to the willow to get the garland. All of these events and the ones that lead up to everyone's death are set in motion by the seemingly inconsequential action of the Hen breaking her oath. But in the times in which these stories developed, lack of commitment and faithfulness to one's community often meant death for that community, even the original transgression was not done out of malice. This is summed up by the last line: ""And they were all dead together"" (emphasis added).This sense of honor and duty are fundamental German virtues. So while the story does indeed have a tragic ending, that tragic ending is brought about by the failure to live up to the morality of the community. In this way the moral lesson is taught through what is lost, rather than what is gained.   ;Hello! I'm from Chicago too. Well, the Western suburbs, to be more precise.  ;"

The more Hans gives away the happier he becomes. It is interesting that the items he begins and ends with are both stones which weigh him down. The first, though a lump of gold, is still a burden which he casts off. The grindstone meets a similar fate. I think this is to illustrate that material possessions, no matter how costly, are still fetters that hold people back from true happiness. Eastern thought might say that Hans exemplifies mindfulness, in that he is perfectly present in each moment he experiences and is equally happy in each. Not once does Hans seem to regret any of the trades he's made. After losing all of these material items, the tale states that ""on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother's "" house. It is in giving up the attachment to the material that he is able to return to ""his mother's house."" Perhaps his mother's house is a metaphor for returning to that pure and unadulterated spiritual state which we all come from. Indeed Hans' childlike nature has a certain innocence and purity to it which is often associated with spiritual perfection. Indeed, the number seven is repeated in this story, firstly in the number of years in which Hans works for his master, and in the number of items which he relinquishes. Seven itself is often associated with a spiritual journey through its relationship to the Seven Days of Creation. ""And on the Seventh day he rested."" Hans rests from his work after seven years, and then rests from his cares after giving up the seventh object. ;Each trade has some sort of catch to it. The horse throws him, the cow kicks him, the pig is stolen. When there isn't a draw back, and if there isn't, then Hans is at best not satisfied for long. He's stuck in a state of perpetual striving until he lets go of the possessions. I think the point here is really that possessions do not bring happiness, and also that the more you have, the more you have to worry about. ;This is an interesting line of thought, and may well have spoken to the story's intended audience. The idea of ""For everything there is a season, and a purpose under Heaven"" would have resonated with the medieval mind and would have reinforced the value of patience in the knowledge that ""the Lord provides."" The only problem with this interpretation, however, is that Hans never actually derived use from any of the items he traded for. With the exception of the Horse, which only served him briefly (and poorly at that) the items were all used to further advance materialism; there was no need that was actually satisfied. ;The birds are not aware of God providing for them either, yet He does. Indeed Hans is much like a little child, and in that respect he has entered the Kingdom of Heaven through his casting off of worldly concerns. ;This tale seemed to me to be one of chastity and diligence in one's spiritual vows. The setting is a garden of cabbages. This would seem to indicate a cloister of celibate women; the cabbage could well be a metaphor for the female anatomy, while the garden represents an isolation of that virtue from the rest of the world. The mother could be representative of the Mother Superior of an order, or perhaps the Virgin Mary. The rabbit, of course, has historically been associated with lust, given it's notorious fertility. His pleas to have the maiden ""sit on his tail"" have very strong phallic connotations. Three times the girl gives in more and more to the rabbit until she relents and follows him to his hutch. This could perhaps be associated with Peter denying Christ three times. The girl refusing to follow the rabbit to the wedding three times could be associated with the three temptations of Christ. When she denies the temptation for the third and final time, she leaves behind only a husk of herself, a doppelganger made out of straw. Straw is often associated with the worldly in folk tales, as opposed to gold which is associated with the spiritual. So while the girl has left behind that part of herself which is concerned with the mundane world, she has, through her final denial of the temptations been able to return to her ""mother"" and the spiritual concerns of the cloister, and is thus triumphant over sin.   ;This tale seemed to me to be one of chastity and diligence in one's  spiritual vows.

In fact this would have been a theme many people would have been familiar with, at least through a ""friend of a friend"". When a woman would become pregnant outside of wedlock she could obe taken to a nunnery. So, even though she had transgressed originally, she could, through renunciation by becoming a bride of Christ, be redeemed. ;Admittedly, these are not clear-cut stories. I suggest that she refused his advances initially, then relented on the third time and ""sat on his tail."" Her refusal to marry him is perhaps indicative of her decision whether or not to maintain a life style of lust, or to pursue a spiritual calling and redeem herself. So, the first time around she does indeed give in to her passions. However, the second time around is more about what she chooses to do after that original mistake. Does she continue to continue to be the town harlot?   Or does she abandon that aspect of herself (the straw imitation) and pursue a life of spiritual dedication.Though she does not end up pregnant in the story, it is at least implied. And suffice it to say, it seems irrelevant if she was corrupted outside of wedlock. A woman who was not a virgin prior to marriage was not in high demand, regardless of whether she had given birth to a bastard. ;One of the things I think we have to remember is to interpret these stories within the correct cultural context. Some interpretations have suggested explanations which have a feminist leaning to them, e.g. the maiden being a strong woman because she leaves him. However, these tales were selected and edited by the Grimm brothers because they were felt to exemplify traditional German virtues and character, such as simplicity and sexual modesty. This quality was called Volksgeist, or ""spirit of the people,"" and was the primary purpose of the Grimms' work; at the time these stories were compiled Germany was still a fragmentary group of un-unified states and these stories we thought to be a central tool in developing a national identity. ;"

To do that, you have to be interpreting the work through today's cultural lens; which means you're probably not interpreting it correctly. Even if Stoker stated things in ways that are an affront to the politically correct sensibilities of some people today, his writing must be understood in the context of its time; it diminishes our understanding of the work if we do not.;Laura,Are you saying that you're only viewing Stoker as racist because you know that people of that time were prone to stereotyping? Isn't that stereotyping as well? What I am saying is that I think discussions of racism are frequently irrelevant. People in contemporary society have just become used to seeing discrimination everywhere and consequently is has become a trite issue. I have not seen any racist statements in my reading of Stoker's work, though granted, I am only a hundred pages in. Can you give some examples of what you mean?;When we think of superstitions we often think of some idea or notion which is backward and lacking in validity. At best, such practices and beliefs may seem quaint. I think Stoker emphasizes Harker's Western worldview so that he can later turn it upon its head. When the only things which are able to fend off Dracula are the Old World ""superstitions"", such as the crucifix, Harker's belief system is inverted with that of the peasants; his objective schema is the one which no longer makes sense, while the ""superstitions"" of the peasants become the only ones with validity. This is a great literary technique, and illustrates the unnatural horror that is Dracula; for Stoker, the Count represents the breakdown of the natural order, and consequently only a methodology which is supernatural can defeat him.;While you make an interesting point, and to some extent it may be true, I don't think ethnocentricity is what Stoker was trying to ultimately convey. In fact, Dracula was highly civilized, yet the very embodiment of horror. By contrast, there was a certain comfort found in the acts of the common rustic folk. As Stoker states in chapter one (page 8 in my book) ""One by one the several passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind,  but each was given with a kindly word, and a blessing..."" (emphasis added). So while Hawker finds these customs somewhat idiosyncratic, he non-the-less seems to find them touching.;From a theological perspective I see how Stoker has portrayed Dracula and many of the things associated with him as a corruption and mockery of Christian beliefs. His consumption of blood and rising from the grave are the most obvious parallels, and his inability to cross water can be seen as the converse of Christ's miracle of walking on water. To expound upon this theme, I think Dracula's association with the wolf is especially noteworthy, as it positions him as the direct enemy of the Lamb of God, and as the predator of Christ's flock. His need to return to the earth of his homeland also associates him with the Chthonic pagan deities of old, and thus as antithetical to Christ. ;Throughout this story we see a continual reference to science on the part of Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward. Usually this takes the form of them mentioning their craft and its tools as weapons against the evil of Dracula. But ultimately the only tools which are effective against him are the tried and true ones of faith, e.g. the crucifix, ancient customs, etc. So what are we to make of this? Is Stoker trying to say that science and faith (or the supernatural as represented in the character of Dracula) are at odds with each other? Or is he trying to demonstrate that science can enrich one's faith (and vice versa), as evidenced by the character of Van Helsing, who though a scientist, uses the weapons of faith to great effect, and uses science to greater understand matters of the supernatural. Indeed, perhaps Van Helsing can be considered a metaphor for the God the Father figure, as well as a scientist; he is depicted as a wise old man, tender, but stern; he has a deep understanding of the workings of nature and of man; and throughout the book he frequently enjoins the other characters to have faith in him, until such a time as he can reveal his true purpose.;I also underlined these sections. The haste that science often rushes to first and final principles with is often counter intuitive; while science emphasizes a meticulous and methodological approach, some of its adherents take those small truths and generalize them into dogma. Van Helsing is cautioning against this mentality. When we think we know the whole truth based upon only pieces of the puzzle, we close our minds to other possibilities that may be equally valid.Van Helsing's quote on faith is reminiscent of Aquinas; it doesn't seem he is saying that faith makes us believe untrue things, but rather allows us to believe things which seem to be untrue based upon small pieces of disjointed evidence, yet are true none-the-less. ""To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.""   ;Good point. He does say ""I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an indulgence."" But he doesn't elaborate on this and I'm not sure how having an indulgence would explain how he obtained it.;Ok, that's very helpful; mine doesn't have that note, and I understood an indulgence to be a dispensation from temporal punishment for a sin. ;It's funny you should mention Darwin; in a way Dracula can be seen to represent the implications of evolutionary theory. He is predatory and his transformations to and from various animal forms could be symbolic of the ""beast within."" Darwinism was a controversial topic then, as now, and the Count was certainly ""red in tooth and claw"" (a quote from Lord Tennyson which Stoker would have been familiar with); he himself may have been a parody of the possible ramifications of the theory of evolution. ;"

It just seems that his transition from naive student to obsessed scientist is never fleshed out. How did he get from point A to point C?Also, I found it disconcerting that it didn't occur to Victor that the creature might still be in his apartment until after he had arrived back there with Clerval; this was only the morning after he had created the monster. How does one forget something like that?   Essentially, much of the story seems contrived. ;Actually, that's more the why, not the how. It's not narratively robust.

I think Hawthorne was juxtaposing his more worldly nature, with the high mindedness of Aylmer. He initially refers to him as ""thou man of clay,"" which at once associates Aminadab with a golem, an artificial construct made of clay, and also with Adam, the primeval man. Further, this association with the earthly makes it ironic that in some ways Aminadab is wiser than than Aylmer (with his head in the clouds, so to speak), as seen when Aminadab says ""If she were my wife, I'd never part with that birthmark."";In the last several readings, and in science fiction in general, immortality and the preoccupation with youth seems to be a common theme. In Alice we encounter the awkwardness, the bitterness and confusion of growing up; in Dracula we see a corruption of the resurrection story; in Frankenstein a perversion of the natural propagation of life. Most recently, Hawthorne seems to be cautioning us that this pursuit of immortality can derail us from actually living life. In ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment"", the four friends become consumed by the Waters of Life, and ""resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida and quaff at morning, noon and night from the Fountain of Youth."" Their desire for eternal youth has become an obsession, for which they are willing to trade the very act of living life, for youth for its own sake. I think Hawthorne is really emphasizing that such lofty goals of science can actually be detrimental to the human experience, unless we question their ultimate motivations; scientific advancement should be in service to the human experience; it is a method to enrich that experience, but not the end in and of itself. ;I also don't think Hawthorne was saying that immortality is immoral in and of itself; I think he was simply cautioning against becoming so preoccupied with it that we stop experiencing the joy of each moment. It's kind of like today when someone spends several hours a day in the gym and only eats wheatgrass. Aren't they diminishing their experience of life a little bit because all of their time is spent in the working out, or when they continually deny themselves other small pleasures of life? I guess a more modern hypothetical question to ask, which still emphasizes Hawthorne's point, would be ""If spending 20 hours a day in the gym would make you immortal, would you do it?"";"

Trust me, books meant for younger readers are often the most well written.  1.  The Lives of Christopher Chant by Diana Wynne Jones (love this author!)2. The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart. (a very clever book. You'll enjoy it.)3. The Giver by Lois Lowry (a must read.)4. The Wind on Fire Trilogy by William Nicholson (I don't think this is very well known, but it's SO good.)5. The Princess Bride by William Goldman (a classic.)- Honorable Mention: Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It's so funny!- I'm seconding the recommendation of A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. That whole series is amazing. - I also loved the His Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman as already mentioned. -  Someone briefly mentioned The Chronicles of Narnia. I just reread all those books and I'd recommend just reading The Magician's Nephew. It's lesser known but really good storytelling and imagination. You'll see.;""Hans in Luck"" is the story of a boy who worked seven years for a lump of gold, but on the walk home to his mother traded it for a horse, traded the horse for the cow, and kept making trades until he only had a rock that he dropped. When I was reading this tale I thought it must be a story with a strong moral of the dangers of squandering your money.  Yet...the moral never came. The ending is ambiguous, and Hans is still happy. The reader doesn't know what will happen and can only guess how his mother will react when he gets home.  So then I thought that this must be a story about how you can be happy.  But no reader would want to follow Hans' example! We can see that Hans is so dumb to trade away all his possessions and be happy while he does it. Is the point of the story really that ""If you're really dumb, you can be happy no matter what""? What do you think the 'point' of this story is?;I remember that poem! I'm starting to think that that's all this story is about too, at least on the surface.;This is an interesting interpretation. Now that you mention how the stones weigh him down, it seems that each possession Hans comes by has a drawback   - the horse runs away, the cow doesn't give milk, etc, etc.  However, there are several things in the story which disagree with your interpretation. First, Hans is very happy from the beginning and doesn't seem to change as a character. And secondly, Hans WANTED the horse, cow, pig, etc very much. He desired the possessions because he didn't have them and thought they would make him happy, and once he had them he didn't want them, which seems to suggest ""The grass is greener on the other side."" To go with your interpretation, I guess you could say Hans is gradually losing his desire for any material possessions so in that way he does change. Kind of like a rich person who, after having everything, realizes things can't bring happiness.I think that relating this story to the creation story is a bit of a stretch, but I'll agree that 7 is a magical and spiritual number. So Hans is going on a spiritual journey of a kind. Very interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts.;When you put it that way, you're exactly right. It seems happiness depends on your perspective.Maybe this story is about how you can't judge others based on what you would have done because everyone is different. Grimm definitely seems to be playing with the reader's expectations and having a bit of a joke because the reader might think ""Oh no! Hans has given away 7 years of hard work!"" but Hans is happy about all his decisions.;Like so many others, nothing really inspired me...I was drawn to stories from the beginning. I believe children naturally are, and this inclination just has to be nurtured by teachers and parents. I've been a preschool teacher, and I love reading to groups of kids, and watching all of them be completely spellbound by the story. They are so into it! They eat it up! They can't get enough! I'm sure you've seen this yourself. People naturally love a good story.The real question should be: what inspired you to keep reading, to be a lifelong reader? For, so many people as they get older just get 'too busy' to read and put reading low on their priorities list after work, relationships, tv, money, whatever else it may be. But we all know how important reading actually is.  For me, I'm an introvert and more shy and reserved by nature. So growing up, reading was a way for me to live vicariously through characters. To explore far off lands and have adventures without having to leave the house. My mom encouraged my reading habit and we made regular trips to the library (she loves to read too). I was highly imaginative and reading fostered that creative and curious side of me. That's why growing up I loved fantasy and still continue to today.  ;I think that you need to approach this course and the stories themselves with an open mind. If you stop after the first story you'll miss some great ones. I am reading the stories a bit at a time and some are delightful, some are thought-provoking, some are strange, some are bizarre, and all of them have more to them than what's on the surface. I am finding them fun to read! So I'd urge you to give it another try. When you signed up for this course you did so to learn, as you have stated. But if you give up so quickly, how can you expect to learn? I personally was able to get the stories onto my kindle following the ""Send to Kindle"" link on this page. So I'd urge you to try again.;I just submitted mine. I liked the small word count. It forced me to be concise and simple with my writing. My essay was originally twice as long and I was able to shorten it. I am relieved that I was able to fit the word count and still make my point.High fives to those that are finished. And good luck if you're still writing! Don't worry about it too much.  ;Inspired by some of the discussions in the threads, I've been thinking about the themes in the Brothers Grimm and how we relate to them today. There are so many themes in these stories to talk about.Which themes are still alive in our culture today? These still feel relevant and we see them in movies, books, and throughout. They may look a little different now, but we can recognize them in the Brothers Grimm.  For example: The Cinderella motif. A mousy, outsider girl undergoes a transformation and gets the man of her dreams. I think we can all agree that we still love this idea and see it in many romance movies and books (even though we do away with other parts of the story).Which themes, on the other hand, are ""dead""? To us they might feel old and antiquated and we may even be angered by them.  For example: The theme of ""Staying in your Place"". In many Grimm stories the poor peasant who tries to be more than that is punished. These stories are from a more regimented society. In our democratic world, we prefer ""rags to riches"" stories instead, when a man who was poor becomes a millionaire. In fact if someone went around going ""The poor should stay poor and the rich should stay rich"" he'd probably get shot!Okay, your turn!  ;Some very good points! I think that the repetition draws out the story and builds the suspense. If there were no repetition the stories would be shorter and resolved quicker and just wouldn't be as interesting. The repetition makes you keep reading to see what will happen that third time.  You follow along with the story better, having some idea what will happen next, and having it happen 3 times seems to raise the stakes. Also there's something very pleasing about the pattern and repetition, like a song that repeats a catchy chorus. I agree that children like repetition and you see it in many children's books because it works.  ;I agree, it's really hard to swallow reading it now! Back then it was the norm for women to be treated like property or prizes to be won but I find it pretty terrible. Definitely, women had less rights, less of a say, and were thought of as lesser creatures in that time. Even though they certainly worked hard (spinning, cooking, cleaning, etc) and men were dependent on them!I have been thinking about the fact that all beautiful women in the stories are virtuous and good and the ugly women are evil or petty. So even back then all women were expected to be beautiful, and if they were not they were nothing! I imagine everyone would be nice to beautiful women but scorn ugly women and so their personalities would be influenced by that. So an ugly woman hated by society would turn bitter and jealous inside, and the stereotype would perpetuate.  There are definitely recurring character tropes in the Brothers Grimm. They were probably common characters in society's imagination. They seem to be shortcuts that made it easy for the Grimm brothers to write the stories. They didn't have to explain a character's personality. They just had to say 'beautiful princess' or 'mean step-mother' or 'youngest brother' or 'old king' and everyone could imagine what they were talking about so they could get on with the story.;"

A regular humanoid, on the other hand, would survive that much of a fall (albeit a few broken bones).As for the 150 fold increase, I'm still not convinced we're using the right equation. Neither do we know the weight of the frog or the prince.Impact (which would give us the possibility of a splat) would be measured by the deceleration caused by hitting the wall. Now that would lead us to the same result, but we take one more factor into consideration - gravity. Because the prince would be heavier than the frog, the secondary vector (that of gravity) would also increase, because of which the prince would hit the wall at an angle (if he even makes it that far - the increase in mXg should cause him to hit the floor rather than continue in the original trajectory) while the frog would hit it dead on.But, like I said, we don't know the distance, the size of the frog, or the muscle density of the princess' throwing arm (which I wager wouldn't be too much).;"

The throw wouldn't be linear by any means. The effect of gravity would slow down the changed object path considerably.And even if we're taking it as linear, a human being hit by a wall at 25-30 mph... would be equivalent to a 10-12 meter fall (whilst not landing on the legs, but the back/chest whatever, onto a solid wall.)So no splat, but plenty of broken ribs and a visit to the blacksmith. I have traceur friends who've had worse falls and are still alive. Either way, absolutely in no shape to get married.... Either that, or one can imagine him changing just before impact, doing an impressive wall-flip off the wall and landing safely on his feet with a bunch of flowers in his hand. Not very scientific, but definitely more fairy tale-ish.;pre-nup?;Stories like these are edited by the teller to be appropriate to the audience, and these stories have been edited so many times that they may be pretty far from the oral tradition when we see them printed, even in an edition that's from the 19th century. The version of Rapunzel in the Lucy Crane collection includes a little detail  (well, two details, really) that my old Andrew Lang collections (Red and Blue Books of Fairy Tales) and  Disney overlooked.   ;The rabbit had no power over the maiden until she ""sat on his tail."" Then, suddenly, he could order her around and she was compelled to do whatever he asked. They were expected to be married, and she could not escape without doing something as drastic as faking her own death.   So yeah, it seems like a cautionary tale about premarital sex, wrapped in a metaphor to obscure the actual meaning from young children.Six Soldiers of Fortune, on the other hand, is about how awesome it would be to form a group of supervillains to plunder all wealth from the kingdom and live happily ever after in the days before Superman and Batman.   :D;In the world of ""The Goose Girl,"" drops of blood on a napkin mean that a girl is safe.   Hmmm...;The clerk and the parson just serve to make things more serious, as demonstrated below:Kids: Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!Clerk: Sorry, kids, but the magistrate has determined that Trix are for rabbits.Kids: Awww!;Elmer Fudd still gets fooled by Bugs Bunny in a dress and bonnet, even today.I'm just wondering why there's not a better description of the maiden's naked walk of shame back home after she dressed the straw girl in all of her clothes.   ;Maybe!   Have you also just always assumed that Elmer had to be some kind of elf because he's only half the size of an average rabbit?;The Grimm tales take place in a world where anything can happen to anyone at any time for any reason. In order to really make an event stand out, it has to happen at least three times. The first time is a random occurrence. The second time establishes a pattern. And the third time breaks that pattern.;Lucky Hans makes a series of logical trades, each of which increase his utility and happiness based on the information available to him at the time. What's not to be happy about?;However bad Hans is at managing his money and possessions, and no matter how foolish he seems when interacting with other people, he is still depicted as well liked and competent enough at his job to earn quite a substantial salary. I've known absolutely brilliant people--software engineers, university professors, and the like--who made horrible investments that no reasonable person would make. Hans is true to life.;Does it have to have a moral?   If you go to a place called ""Nut Mountain,"" you'd think there would be so many nuts lying around that you wouldn't have to be greedy about the first one you happen to find.;There's nothing sexually symbolic about the rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, except for how they both entered a hole located under a bush. And all that key-and-lock imagery. And the sign that says, ""Eat me!"" And how she ends up swimming in an ocean of bodily fluids. And the worry about whether the rabbit has adequately covered his hands with protective gloves. But aside from all that, nothing sexually symbolic at all.;Doctor #7 Sylvester McCoy's companion, Ace, would be the most like Alice. She called him Professor, like Dodson actually was a professor, and The Curse of Fenric is an adventure based on a game of chess, much like Through the Looking Glass.   It's not just that Sylvester McCoy plays chess--Matt Smith plays chess against the Cybermen too--but Ace is a pawn in the game and figures out a strategy for winning.  ;Unlike Eve, the fisherman's wife doesn't even have a snake to blame--the idea and the greed are all hers. Meanwhile, the fisherman's fault is not saying, ""My wife is unreasonable and will never be happy, so... could you get me a different wife instead?""   :D;When I was in first grade, The Fisherman and His Wife was a story the school librarian read to our class during our weekly visit to the library. When she got to the part where the wife wanted to be pope, I raised my hand to ask about what a pope was, because I'd never encountered that word before. She replied that as a public school librarian, she was not allowed to tell us what a pope was, and I knew what it meant when an adult couldn't talk about something to children. ""Oh! It has to do with sex! She wants to be a pope because a pope is a person who gets to have lots and lots of sex!""   I was immediately sent out of the room and didn't get to hear the end of the story, and when I went to look for it afterwards, the book had been removed from the shelf. After all this time, it's great to finally learn how the story ends!;George Burns and his wife, Grace Allen, had a comedy routine for many years on radio and then early television. I've seen clips of Burns and Allen and couldn't help thinking of them while reading this story. George would tell Grace to, ""Say goodnight, Gracie."" and she would say, ""Goodnight, Gracie!"" just like the way Kate is also extremely literal and prone to forgetting her own identity.   But George and Grace stick together and love each other, just like Fred and Kate, and it's very sweet. Patronizing, yes, but still very sweet.Kate is among the most fully realized characters in any of these tales. She proves that you don't need witchcraft or talking animals in your fairy tale when you have such a distinctive and amusing personality!   The fantasy comes from imagining a world in which Kate can be so over the top foolish, and Fred can be so amazingly forgiving of her shortcomings.;I wanted more from these tales. I wanted to get to know the characters better, to understand their motivations, and to get a better sense of who they are and how they relate to their world. With a few notable exceptions like Hans in Luck and the princess in The Frog Prince, the characters are two dimensional and might as well be sleepwalking through their stories.   To go directly from Grimmland to Wonderland really makes me appreciate Lewis Carroll's Alice for all her humor, quirks, and charm.;  Alice Liddell was born on May 4th, 1852. The first book takes place on her seventh birthday, in 1859. The second book takes place six months later.;The professor was applying a Freudian critique to the tale, which is valid, although certainly not the only way to read things. I don't know if I buy it entirely either, but having an alternate perspective does make the story more interesting to think about.;Every story has an implicit or explicit backstory. If you accept that these particular stories have common and predictable attributes, sequences, and themes, it's not much of a stretch to extrapolate backward to uncover likely elements that are most consistent with the format and genre.;There are many theories of literary analysis that will tend to contradict each other, but that doesn't mean they don't have value or should be dismissed entirely. Professor Rabkin seems to favor Freudian theory, Christian iconography (which he even applies to a pre-Christian Aesop story), some aspects of feminist theory, and an overall historical and social context, but these stories could also be seen through so many other lenses as well. As a writer, my main goal in this course is to deconstruct the material in a way that will help me become a better writer. The takeaway for me is these tales contain something primal and powerful that I would love to understand in a practical way, so that I might add to my writing toolkit. Symbolism of the natural world, analogies to developmental psychology, religious allegory, and Propp's morphology theory... I'm still trying to process it all, and that's just Week One!  But there's also a cautionary tale that the power in these stories can be used for evil in the wrong hands. The Grimms intended their tales as nationalist propaganda. As a side effect, they indoctrinated children with antisemitism and taught that it was perfectly fine to throw people you don't like into ovens. A few generations later, just look where that got us.;Yup. Maybe the Grimm brothers didn't intend for anything evil to happen, but that doesn't make them any less negligent for deliberately combining nationalism, antisemitism, and a desensitized attitude toward murder in tales meant for impressionable minds.I said that I don't buy into the Freudian analysis of the story, but many people do so I'm a least going to give it some thought. Of coruse I'd like to hear more about your opposing viewpoint as well.;Try to find a copy of the Annotated Alice in Wonderland. Lots of information about where Carroll got his names.;"

They were aligned with a group who sought to unite the Germanic tribes by creating dubious racial connections to the light-skinned Aryan conquerors of antiquity. The sampling of stories that Lucy Crane translated into English did not include the most egregiously antisemitic stories in the original collection, such as the one that the professor described, ""The Jew in the Thornbush,"" where antisemitic elements were added by the Grimms to an older story that did not originally have them.   Combined with the power of the fairy tale format, this material was most definitely intended to be propaganda by 19th Century German nationalists, and was then used for more nefarious propaganda purposes in the 20th Century. They had a great impact on impressionable minds--and yes, children are not the only ones who have impressionable minds.  ;The professor pointed  out  the blatant, intentional  antisemitism in a  Grimms' story that is actually called ""The Jew in the  Thornbush.""  He pointed us  to an earlier  Italian version of that story that didn't have antisemitism in it, and which would have been sitting on the shelf in the Grimms' university library.  He  showed us how the Grimms had a habit of adapting tales from  other sources and claiming them as part of the Germanic folk canon. He  showed us  exactly what elements the Grimms added to the tales,  and the  demonstrated political agenda they were hoping to advance as a result.  He showed us how  the Grimm  stories fail to follow Vladimir Propp's rules that successfully identify genuine works for folk literature from every other culture that's ever existed on Planet Earth. And after all that,  you think Professor Rabkin  is just seeing what  he wants  and that  he's the one who's prejudiced?;The old woman in Hansel and Gretel was shoved into an oven because she wanted to eat the children. This is awfully close to the ""blood libel"" that antisemites have historically used to claim that Jews killed Christian children and baked their blood into Passover matzohs. In Nazi Germany, these slanders were used to justify putting real people into real ovens in real life. The concentration camp crematoria burned  up millions of men, women, and children.   I'm not saying the Grimm brothers foresaw this or would have wanted it to happen, but their stories and the themes contained in them were used to justify pure evil.This is all completely separate from the anti-feminist themes you keep alluding to. Your criticism may be valid, but  that doesn't give you license to denigrate the opinions of others or to ignore facts that you find inconvenient.;First, read the Wikipedia entry on the  V  lkisch movement that ""combined sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore, local history and a 'back-to-the-land' anti-urban populism"" in the 19th Century onward, and how it influenced Nazi ideology and political practices. (Hint: ""Adolf Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: 'the basic ideas of the National-Socialist movement are populist (v  lkisch) and the populist (v  lkisch) ideas are National-Socialist.')Next, read the Wikipedia entry on the 1935 Nuremberg Laws that the Nazis put in place to strip Jews of their civil rights, and their background in  v  lkisch prejudice.   You may then go on to read up on whatever history of the Holocaust you prefer.Then tell me again about how this alleged campaign to harass useless old women was the real horror of Nazi Germany.  ;The Holocaust Museum is a very special and important place.

Please introduce yourself, share your goals for the course, and some of your thoughts on the material we've seen so far.My name is Greg R. Fishbone, and I write science fiction and fantasy novels for young readers. My latest is the Galaxy Games series for ages 9-12, published by the Tu Books imprint at Lee & Low Books. Their focus is on multicultural science fiction and fantasy for midgrade and young adult readers, filling a much-needed gap in the industry. I am also a longtime member and assistant regional advisor for the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, an organization I highly recommend to anyone interested in writing for children.I am interested in this course because I learned writing in an academic setting from elementary school through college but had to pick up genre theory from my own pleasure reading outside of class. Fantasy and science fiction stories have been my favorites for as long as I can remember, but I've never had the opportunity to dissect them as an academic exercise in order to figure out how the genre developed and what makes it so appealing.What I got out of the Grimm section: Roughly two thirds of the tales in the Crane collection were entirely new to me. Of the other third, I'd only encountered a handful in their ""original"" form, and the rest in adaptations. Most of these tales, as they are written, would not be published today without some major revision and retelling, but we can recognize a power that comes from morphology and symbolism. How can we use that in our writing? Princess Leia was clearly a damsel in distress, and It now makes sense that Gene Roddenberry put characters in red shirts if they were about to die a horrible death, so symbolism is alive and well in science fiction. Is anyone up for digging deeper into Vladimir Propp's theories?Looking forward to Lewis Carrol: The start of children's literature as its own thing?

The villain makes an attempt at reconnaissance.  5. The villain receives information about his victim.   (The villain gets an answer.)  6. The villain attempts to deceive his victim by using persuasion, magic, or deception.  7. The victim submits to deception and thereby unwittingly helps his enemy. (Hero sleeps.)Villainy / Lack (Plot set in motion):8. The villain causes harm or injury to a member of a family.  8a. One member of a family either lacks something or desires to have something.  9. Misfortune or lack is made known: the hero is approached with a request or command; he is allowed to go or he is dispatched.  10. The seeker (hero) agrees to or decides upon counteractions.  11. The hero leaves home.  12. The hero is tested, interrogated, attacked, etc. which prepares the way for his receiving either a magical agent or helper.   (The donor usually enters the story here.)  13. The hero reacts to the actions of the future donor.  14. The hero acquires the use of a magical agent.  15. The hero is transferred, delivered, or led to the whereabouts of an object of search.Path A: Struggle and Victory over Villain; End of Lack and Return:16. The hero and villain join in direct combat.  17. The hero is branded.  18. The villain is defeated.  19. The initial misfortune or lack is liquidated.  20. The hero returns.  21.

I will have to get a copy. Thanks!;Thanks, William. What are you writing?;Has anyone ever considered writing a retold fairy tale? I've always thought Sleeping Beauty had the most potential for this, because there's a natural hundred year gap in the story. She goes to sleep in an atavistic ""once upon a time"" era, but there's no reason why she couldn't wake up in modern times. Or futuristic times. Or why she couldn't be a samurai warrior instead of a princess. Or--shoot, did I just describe the plot to Samurai Jack?   :D;What did everyone take away, from a writer's perspective, from Lewis Carroll's books? I found it interesting that they were not written for a broad audience but for one particular reader--in a one-of-a-kind handwritten manuscript!   It reminded me of the popular public speaking advice of ignoring the auditorium full of people and focusing on a single face in the crowd. Would it help any of us to keep one reader in mind when writing and come up with the most entertaining story just for them?;Another question, from listening to Professor Rabkin compare Alice's fall down the rabbit hole to Adam and Eve's ""Fall"" from the Garden of Eden...Have any of you intentionally inserted naturalistic symbols, Christian allegory, or allusions to Greek mythology into your stories as a subtle subtext that a casual reader would not necessarily notice? I haven't done so, at least consciously, and yet readers looking for symbolism always seem to find it.   Some of it may come from the subconscious of the reader, and some may come from the subconscious of the author, but is there any advantage gained in trying to plant things intentionally that only a literature professor would find?I'm looking forward to Professor Rabkin's analysis of John Carter of Mars because, obviously, any character whose initials are J.C. is intended to be a Jesus figure.   ;Retold myths are different from what I was talking about, but I am interested in hearing how you approached yours. Would a reader need to be familiar with the original to get the most out of it? Did you provide an explicit reference to the old story, or did you just use the themes and elements in a new setting?;It sounds like a very effective and powerful story. So if I'm understanding correctly, the links to the original myth were implicit but you were able to hook your editor with them, and thinking about the myth made it easier to write the story?;If I were making a movie, there would be pressure to have to be 100 minutes long, more or less, so it could be shown on TV in two hours (with commercial breaks). If I'm writing a book, it can be exactly as long as it needs to be in order to tell the story.If I were making a movie, I'd need to first raise tens of millions of dollars, or a hundred million plus if I want to make a blockbuster. Even indie films cost more money than you would think. That means getting a production company, studio, or investors involved, and they will want some control over how the film is made. If I'm writing a book, it's just me, my laptop, and all the coffee I can drink.If I were making a movie, I'd need to scout out locations for filming or build the location in a studio or with computer graphics. The perfect location might be too far away, or unavailable, or the weather might not cooperate during the filming, so I might have to settle for something else.   If I'm writing a book, I can put the scenes anywhere I want and also control the weather.If I write a book that represents my singular vision and somebody wants to turn it into a movie, they will run into all the format, budget, and control issues I managed to avoid. I'd wish them the best of luck, though.;Comics are a medium like novels, movies, or video games. You certainly wouldn't say that ""all movies are fantasy"" or ""all novels are science fiction."" Like those other media, comics can tell any kind of story--romance, western, mystery, historical fiction, biography, memoir--but through a quirk of the industry, comic books in the United States from the 1950s onward have been focused (with some exceptions) on superheroes, which have fantasy and science fiction tropes. Even Archie and his Riverdale friends live in a world that co-exists with The Punisher.If you are interested in the theory of comics as a medium, I'd strongly recommend Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.  ;People don't write letters as much as they used to, so today we have books written in the form of email (Snail Mail No More by Paula Danziger and Ann Martin) and texts (ttyl by Lauren Myracle). Also, diary format will never go out of style as long as Jeff Kiney keeps making Wimpy Kid books. I wrote a book in the form of letters (The Penguins of Doom by Greg R. Fishbone) but haven't come across many others that aren't meant to be historical.I can't say why Stoker or Shelley wrote their books in this format, but I used it because it was the best way to tell the story I wanted to tell. I tried writing in a traditional format a number of ways but it just wasn't working. Then it struck me that if my characters were writing letters, they could be coy and deceptive in a way that first-person narrative seldom is. People write letters to convey information, but also because they want something from the recipient. They might want different things from different people at different times, so the same person's writing style will vary according to their goals at the moment. It could be an update on what's been going on lately, a call for help, an excuse for missing a math assignment, a request for money, or anything else.Today, you'd have to ask what kind of person would take the time to write out a book's worth of letters. I came up with a character who likes to make excuses, and it was very convenient for her to say she didn't have time to do something because she'd been too busy writing letters. Back in the 1800s this wouldn't have been a problem, because all educated folks would have been communicating by letter or not at all. Unless maybe there were books published in the form of telegrams.;Don't know why that posted as anonymous...;I haven't gotten there yet, but in chapters I've seen it says Seward is recording his thoughts by phonograph.

I read Dracula in high school, but it doesn't even seem like the same book. Why didn't I notice that Dracula is brilliant, and that Bram Stoker is a total genius? I certainly would have read more horror if I had.;Professor Rabkin missed an opportunity in his lecture on children's literature. In discussing a classic work with hidden depths and meaning, he could have chosen to clear up the common misconception that books for young readers are insubstantial and in some way inferior to more adult works. Instead, Rabkin doubled down on the myth by implying that the meaningful elements in the Alice books were only meant for adult readers. According to Rabkin, not even Lewis Carroll, who loved and respected children, would have wasted his best material on them.Because this one great work of children's literature happens to be written in an episodic format, Rabkin informs us that episodic fiction is a common feature of children's literature. He calls these books ""pearl necklaces"" because the beginning and ending are set off by a series of simplistic plot encounters that can be added, removed, or rearranged at will and without consequence, like pearls on a strand. This describes the works of Lewis Carroll, but I'm struggling to come up with another comparable example in children's or adult fiction in the modern era, with the possible exception of certain anthologies. The children's authors I know craft their narrative structures with as much care as any adult fiction author.  Maybe the plots in children's literature are more straightforward than the labyrinthine reversals of a Tom Clancy novel, but they are solid structures and less likely to contain plot holes. Maybe the vocabulary and sentence structure are simpler than in an Umberto Eco novel, but  the meaning is clear and less likely to be misinterpreted.  Happy endings are not required in children's literature. What's more common is a hopeful ending, where things aren't entirely wrapped up but there's still hope, or a cliffhanger ending in a series book.  And I'm sure fans of Nancy Drew and Encyclopedia Brown would be surprised to hear that tales of the great detective are ""much more adult"" than stories meant for children.I just spent the last six months revising a middle grade manuscript to ensure that not a single scene could be removed without damaging the plot, or added without wrecking the pacing, or swapped with another scene without losing the narrative thread or character development. There's nothing wrong with the episodic style that Lewis Carroll used to such great effect, but  I do not write pearl necklaces! And I probably wouldn't be able to, even if I wanted.In my experience, books for adults are the ones more likely to contain a string of episodic pearls that have nothing to do with the plot or themes of a story. Popular thrillers contain hundreds of pages of bloat, on the theory that adults have longer attention spans and don't mind wading through unnecessary scenes to get to the heart of a story. Young readers won't put up with that. If they're not hooked in the first chapter, and if their attention isn't held all the way to the end, they'll toss the book and grab another. It's more difficult to write for children than it is to write for adults, but rewarding for anyone up to the challenge.;Encyclopedia Brown was what I had in mind as a character anthology--short stories about a single character collected into one volume. However, even an Encyclopedia Brown short story is arranged in a structure. Every scene between the beginning (a mystery presents itself) and the end (Encyclopedia solves the case) is necessary to provide the information and clues necessary to solve the case. There's never a scene where Encyclopedia Brown talks to a bunch of flowers or has a tea party, just because a bunch of flowers or a tea party happens to appear in his path, without advancing the plot. There are no pearls in Encyclopedia Brown--nothing can be removed, added, duplicated three times, or moved to another place in the story.;"

And if I'm seeing that as a non-Christian, it has to be true. When I was a kid, convinced that vampires were hiding under my bed or in my closet, I kept a Star of David on my night table to ward them off. I figured that had to be just as good as a cross.

The fact that she doesn't succeed in killing them makes it possible to save her soul.;And did anyone else find it weird that the child was referred to as ""it"" when Van Helsing uses ""him"" to refer to just about every inanimate object he comes across?

In Dracula, Lucy clearly meant to be a fallen angel like Lucifer, and Dracula is clearly meant to be a dragon or devil figure, so that's evidence that Stoker falls into that category of author who care more deeply about the meaning of character names. I'd buy the professor's argument on Mina's name, in this case.  The real question for me was why have a Johnathan (Harker) and a John (Sewer) so prominent in the same book?   I know John was a popular name back then, but you usually don't give two main characters the same first name unless you're deliberately inviting confusion between them.;"

I noted that the documents were not arranged strictly in chronological order but the few exceptions served to improve narrative flow without being too jarring. I liked that notes were composed in different media--handwriting, shorthand, typewriter, phonograph, newsprint, and telegram--with different stylistic attributes for each. There is a definite shift in Dr. Seward's voice, for example, when his diary shifts from phonograph to handwriting on the journey to Transylvania. I liked the use of accented English to denote class and national origin. Van Helsing's accent not only requires a fluency in German, but a familiarity with the grammar errors made by German speakers who are learning English. I liked Stoker's awareness that these documents are being produced in real time. Often, a character is interrupted in the middle and picks up a diary entry with a different line of thought. Jonathan Harker, writing on the boat at night, has to mention that he is using the furnace of the steam engine as his light. Letters are written with different purposes and different audiences in mind.

I wondered whether I might run into Dracula. I started to walk a little faster...""  Second person narration is about the reader. That's rare, but you'll find it in those choose your own adventure books: ""You are running through the woods at night. You see movement in the bushes. Suddenly, you are attacked by Dracula!

An interesting essay on this phenomenon from a writing perspective:http://new.websnark.com/post/53528789537/on-writing-and-refrigerators;My understanding of the trope is that a (usually female) character is brutally killed so that the (usually male) hero of the piece can make a gruesome discovery that fuels angst and character development.   I don't know that the three works you cite really fit the mold. In     The Birthmark,    the wife is killed during an elective procedure and the character development we see is what cause both the wife and her husband to accept the risk of death that they knew in advance might result.    Rappaccini   s Daughter    follows the same format--the woman  chooses to drink a potion that might either represent either death or freedom, or where she believes that death might be a better fate than what her father has in mind for her. In  Dr. Heidegger   s Experiment,    there is no in-scene death and therefore also no discovery of a body.;I think Hawthorne is definitely picking women as his victims to provoke a stronger reaction both from the readers and from the male protagonists. Poe, however, is killing off, dismembering, and walling up men and women, old and young, human and feline, in an equal opportunity way. In fact, a very effective stage production I once saw of ""The Tell Tale Heart"" had a woman as the killer and stayed true to the text, since I don't think the first person narrator is ever identified by gender.;The common assumption that a character is male when their gender is not actually identified either way is called ""male default.""   It's not discrimination but a deeply ingrained aspect of our culture, along with a corresponding ""white default"" that assumes that all characters are white unless they are stated to be otherwise.;Rock on!;My first Doctor was Tom Baker, and my first serial was The Deadly Assassin--which gave me a very warped idea of what the show was about. It's probably the only sequence in the original series where the Doctor has an adventure without any companions. Technically I don't think there's a single human character in the entire story--they're all Gallifreyan. So I thought Doctor Who was about this alien detective who travels around in a blue box, all by himself, solving crimes and foiling assassination plots.;There is a Sherlock/Doctor Who crossover, sort of, also from the Tom Baker era: ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang.""  ;Oh, and hey!   H.G. Wells actually appears as a character in ""Timelash"" from the Colin Baker era, so this conversation is now back on topic!;My thought was that generational power in the story passes from Moreau and Montgomery to the Beast People. Prendick is a bit of a wildcard, associated at first with the generation of Moreau but eventually defining himself as an equal to the Beast People rather than their superior. Fortunately for him, he holds onto his humanity as the Beast People descend back to their animal nature.;Grotesque theology for a grotesque society. Prendick very blatantly tries to set up Moreau as a supernatural figure in order to cement his own power over the beasts, and even gets Montgomery to go along with him for a while. Essentially, ""Moreau no longer walks among you, but he's still watching from on high. And he will reward those who continue to follow his laws.""   Prendick himself is implied to be an atheist.;I found it interesting that Wells doesn't name the planet that crashes into Neptune, but with a world associated with fire and death, and following the tradition of naming worlds after Roman gods, he probably would have also come up with Pluto.;"

Good use of examples from the stories, but like Martha, I would be wary of your statement that ""only"" spinsters and tailors (I would include Rumplestiltskin as a spinster, albeit an unnatural one) can change fate. The Six Swans were redeemed from their fate by the sister's needlework; and it's a spinster in Sleeping Beauty who is the unwitting vehicle of fate--she is not able to change it. Maybe this is why in the Disney version, the spinster who lets the girl touch the spindle is the disguised evil fairy. Ah ha--a disguise! more cloth!   Good job on surfacing the relationship between cloth and fate. ;Thanks to all who are contributing to this thread! Here's my essay:                         Nearly half of the tales in Household Stories involve a beautiful character, often a girl or woman, whose beauty is important to the plot. Feminine beauty is used in three main ways: to elevate the woman's value as a reward; to display her internal goodness; or to contrast with negative personality traits, especially pride.    In stories like the Golden Goose, Queen Bee, Golden Bird, The Gallant Tailor, and Faithful John, a beautiful girl is either the motive for the central male character to go on a quest, or serves as a reward for a man who completes a seemingly impossible task (or both). The phrase    beautiful princess    sums up the importance of the character: she is a prize to be won, like wealth or power.    Beauty in girls of common birth (eg., a miller   s daughter) is often associated with positive character traits (   pleasant,       obedient,       industrious   ), or with an innate nobility. In    Brother and Sister,       The Six Swans,    and    Twelve Brothers,    a sister works diligently on a secret task to release her brother(s) from a spell. When a passing king takes the sister to his kingdom and marries her (presumably because of her beauty), an older woman (stepmother, witch, mother-in-law) accuses the new queen of deception. By completing the magical task, the young queen demonstrates her loyalty and innocence, and saves both her brother(s) and her own life. Her external appearance and character emerge as truly queenly.  The theme of the beautiful character in conflict with ugly, lazy, or evil female characters runs through many tales. When beauty and pride or vanity are combined in one character (evil queen in    Snow White;    proud princess in    King Thrushbeard   ), the tale ends with the punishment of the female character. She is either humiliated and redeemed, as in    The Frog Prince,    or executed by torture, like the evil queen in    Snow White.    In the Grimm's worldview, beauty should be more than skin deep.      ;Thanks to both Stephanie and Martha for your thoughtful comments on my essay. Martha--I tend to over-write, so the word count was a serious issue for me on this essay. I'll try to narrow my scope next time. i was looking for a cross-cutting theme that would use examples from many stories--my first draft was about 500 words.

Good job! (On my next essay, I am going to try to emulate your spare introduction. I wasted a lot of words in my first paragraph saying what I was going to say.)Thanks for posting.;Hi, Karen. Is this your essay, or are you trying out a possible theme for feedback? If it's an essay, one thing to watch is your sentence structure. Your ideas are interesting--I now want to go look up the derivation of the word ""Grimoire""--but your writing is plagued with inclomplete sentences, so it is hard to see what your point is. If these are notes for an essay, i see several ideas that could be fleshed out, including the final point about power and anonymity. That's fascinating, and I'd like to hear more. Too bad it's time to move on to Alice (with a known author...although he did write under a pseudonym...hmm).Off to my ""big dictionary,"" as my kids call it, to look up Grimoire!Cheers! Enjoy the course.;Just looked up Grimoire in wikipedia--it's generally considered to be a book of magic or spells, although common household remedies might be included (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire). The use of ""Grimmerie"" in Gregory Maguire's Wicked series is an intentional reference to a book of spells. When I read Wicked, I thought the name of the magic book was actually a sly reference to the brothers Grimm, so this is an interesting thread for me. ;For the Grimm's tales especially, the concept of author  intent is not as important as it might be for a work like Alice in  Wonderland. The Grimms gathered stories, selected certain versions,  edited them, and may have rewritten some. But the ""authors"" were others  who lived before the Grimms. Many of the tales are folktales with a long  history of oral transmission, and the Grimms may have seen their role  more as anthropologists (albeit through a nationalistic prism) than  authors. They even included different versions of the same basic story as part of their own study of the stories and the people who told them.For the upcoming novels with a single known author, much can  be gained and understood by understanding something about the author's  time, background, and his/her intentional motives for composing the work, and the stated meaning if he or she explained that in their lifetime. But I  agree with Stephanie that additional interpretations by others are  interesting and valuable ways of exploring a work's relevance and  importance, in part because authors are not always aware of all of the  themes and meanings in their own works. I'm fairly certain that James  Joyce would be flabbergasted by the scholarly and popular  interpretations that have been lent to his work. That doesn't make the  author's intentional meaning less important, or the reader's  interpretation less meaningful. I think our challenge in this course is to engage with the professor and our colleagues, understand their comments and viewpoints, and come to our own understanding of the importance or lack of importance of the stories and themes for our lives and in our culture. If someone else's interpretation doesn't make any sense to you, fashion your own. Your interpretation may switch on a lightbulb for someone else.   ;"

It may be my luck, but I had a grandmother who read a lot and used to retell the stories to me, rather than read them. I came to know Siegfried like this: The knight bathed in dragon's blood. Thanks to her I knew a closer version to the Grimm's ones before viewing the Disney movies.;that is, Kendal, the whole point of my essay by the way. By 1812 and the romantic era, be it in the Grimm Brothers, be it in Lord Byron, what we see is a reaction to the medieval morality and practice of seeing one's children as properties. The parent bargains away his child to the witch as a fair trade for some vegetables and the witch then treats her like a treasure, not a person. She, however, refuses to be just a treasure and secretly marries some random prince who happens to be brave enough to challenge that same conception. Note that there is no scene of the prince telling his king father that he met this peasant girl on a tower and will he please may have er for a wife even though she is obviously not noble born?;Sorry, coming of late here, but the Witch in Rapunzel is severe but, in a teutonic way, just. One may argue that the rampions were enchanted to look extra appealing, but that may also be said of a certain fruit of a certain tree on a vary famous garden.  As for the twins, well, they are the prince's son, obviously, since the narrator recalls Rapunzel as ""his wife"". The thing is, sex and marriage are portrayed as intrinsically correlated, many marriages in Grimm's stories are ""celebrated"" away from the family. There is a very protestant way of simplifying this: you make love to the one you love and that's who you marry.   At least in Rapunzel. The Witch is, in some way, the wronged one and in no moment in the story prior to discovering the girl had been comforting a man, was she cruel the the girl (Rapunzel did not want for food nor was abandonedd by her caretaker on the woods to die, nor had her father order the death of her 12 brothers for no reason whatsoever, i can go on almos forever ... ). There is something of an ""old bargaining god"" in the witch that calls to memory some of the stories in older germanic tales. Making her a Witch and giving the kniving girl a happy ending is a sign of a new morality. Think back to the greek myths and see what happens to a promised maiden who has sex (even though she was raped, something Rapunzel evidently was not): if Rapunzel's name were Medusa, her fate would have been much much worse and without hope of redemption.;Kendal, the word in the text is  wife, that to me says that Rapunzel's was not a rape. The idea being that a person is not a thing and, unlike things, even if you try and hide them, they find their way into the world (in her case, through her singing).;The thing about oral sotries is that, they mutate, Katrina. You may think of Rapunzel as an imprisioned child, but you can also see that as a metaphore for a ""protected treasure"". One of the older versions of medusa is that her ""seduction"" was actually a rape, being Medusa outside to gather flowers for the temple. It is a story so resonant in times of ""slut walks"" that it might result in a thread of itself, though one might argue that the ""robber's bridesmaid"" has a closer relation to Medusa's myth. There is, in both of them, a modern morality where the women are not to be eternally persecuted for not bowing to the strongest force, be it male or supernatural.;NEVER, EVER APOLLOGIZE FOR CORRECTING SOMEONE. This is how we learn.Please, it is a pleasure to learn and it does not shame me at all. I learned to read by reading greek myth and to me it comes almost as the same way the Grimm tales come, clouded in a fog of oral tradition, but that is good, I guess. So, thank you for reminding me of that earlier medusa story. Of course I am not defending that you coup up a child in a tower, that was some of my point, the tale tells of a new way of seeing people, the romantic way, not as properties as women have been during the middle ages. What I was saying is that the Witch isn't wicked ""from her perspective"", the old perspective, the fundamentalist perspective where people and goods are interchangeable. It is no coincidence that Rapunzel and Rampio are similar (in portuguese the plant is called Rapuncio), the whitch see's both as the same, as things that are desirable but belong to her. As I first stated, shehas more the workings of an old god, as opposed to the christian (protestant) view of tolerance and forgiveness.;Three is the common sense human number for ""this is no longer a coincidence"". Peter denies Jesus three times to let the early christian underestand how much he is deserving of his later contrition and forgiveness. It was not a scared man's response, it was a true denial, and thus his confession of the sin makes the forgiveness that deal greater. In these stories too the three appears as that proof that something is inequivocal.  ;I agree with Sarah here. Repetition comes through as both mnemonic and suspense though, given their intended audience, character's character also is built on repetitions of their action, and are usually seen as being consistently wicked, consistently good or consistently loyal.;Take the Fisherman's Wife, repetition here in the calling of the man of the sea is giving you the hopelessness of the husband under a manipulating overachieving wife.  As a side note, it's the basic archetype used to create Jorah Mormont in Game of Thrones.;there is also a correlation of ""marrying"" and ""having sex"", as seen in Rapunzel, the King's son ""visits"" Rapunzel over a fortnight and then finds her much later with their two children. Many other marriages in Grimm's stories happen away from friends anda family.;Thanks for your comments. I do believe the stories are child appropriate, however, especially today. There was an awareness that people would marry in their teen during the 1800s, so you need to prepare children to deal with adult world. Somewhat during the late 1800s and 1900s we started protecting the children more (some may blame queen Victoria and the puritans). However, today, with the access to absurd amounts of misinformation, telling our children that the world is not just roses, that one strong must use his/her strengh to protect the weaker, etc. There is an urgency in bettering our education to toughen our kids. The world is a beautifull place, but beauty is not the same as innocent.;That is why I said in an earlier comment that I find this stories well in need to be told as is to the children. At least you have a parent there guiding them through the morality and wuestions that may arise.  ;One may say that the whole point of all these tales, in regard for children is:The world is a dangerous place, but if you are clever, brave and fight for the right reasons, you will end up being happy in a way or the other.;Adding to that, being happy is not always marrying the prince or princess or being wealthy beyond measure.

Being brazilian and in the middle of these discussions myself, I wish to know the opinion of our dear classmates.One of the propositions, the one I support at least, states that there should be a direct, web based democracy, with a small but effective body of government composed mainly of public servants with just a small core of elected officials. Now, how's that for political sci-fi?;Dear Anonymous, it all started with some protests about the cost of public transport, which is very high againt the income and was getting higher. The thing is that the police took such a harsh response to it that other issues started arising, first of all the right to protest in itself. As many of the protesters were students, the usual media blindfold of ""it's just a bunch of bums with nothing better to do"" fell quite fast. A female journalist was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet and a photographer friend of mine was spanked by unidentified cops after one of the protests. Then it all boiled over, the corruption schemes, the enourmous, and sometimes illegal, spenditure with the stadiums for the World Cup 2014, the crisis with the public health care system, and whatever else you can think is wrong with any country. For the first time, since it happened to the middle class, right wing and left wing went into the streets to protest together. There is a brooding sense of revolution in the air.;Transport fees did go down a bit, in Porto Alegre it went even lower than it was last year, the problem is that this was achieved by granting tax isemption to the companies working transport and not by making them open their books and proving the real cost of the service. People are, of course, demanding free transportation now. To put it in perspective, bus fares in Brazil's biggest cities are just a little lower than the rates in Paris (BRL 3.55, S  o Paulo is now BRL3,00, Porto Alegre BRL 2.80) but our minimum wage is about a fifth fo that in France. A minimum wage worker here receives BRL 678,00, so, if you work in S  o Paulo, and you need 2 buses to go to work and back, as is usually the case there, you spend 40% of your salary going just going to work and you do that in an overcrowded bus sometimes for two and a half hours. Remember, S  o Paulo has about three times te population of NY or, roughly, it's Belgium.;Right now I am in the countryside, where I live most of my week, but my hometown, orto Alegre is burning.

According to her, the ineer workings of our brain do follow in some way the lamarckian thoery of use and disuse, thus an intelectually challenged individual may become more intelligent and an emotionally slanted individual may become truly emontionless, when both combine - all the brain power (libido for those Freudian amongst us) goes into a focused learning curve with little to no positive contact with a community (Mary Shelley got that right also), the result is a psychopath.  In warning us about her fictious kind of monster, the-better-Shelley (as I like to call her) also ended up warning us about a very common modern-day one.  Other studies have surfaced in these last few years that most psychopaths can focuse their libido and violence in ways to appear normal, having most of them concentrated in the administration fields of finance and big corporations.

FALSE,St388,Coh2,1,0,0,0.08,1,0.001936842,0.1,0,0.05,0.0486697,0,"I think there are several different things going on. First, many contemporary writers and other novelists have used fairy tales as inspiration, or have alluded to them. This makes sense as well if you think of how hearing these stories might have been among the earliest memories some writers have, and if you believe as some do that fairy tale elements represent some kind of primal archetypes of the subconscious (Jungian interpretation). So allusions may be conscious and well as unconscious.  At the same time, you'll hear varying versions of these tales, both across cultures and even within European culture. The Grimm brothers collected these oral tales by traveling around the countryside. In many cases, as I understand it, they heard different versions and then picked and chose those elements they wanted to include. They may have cleaned up things and added some narrative consistency or causality. Then you have a variety of translators such as Lucy Crane or Padraic Column (the first version of Grimm tales I read) who translated the Grimms tales into English and so made other changes as well. Other compilers/authors such as Perrault or even HC Andersen put their own spin on these motifs. So the results are varying versions of the same stories. It's interesting to compare the versions and look for which differences might have resulted from the translation, or from whoever first wrote them down (perhaps taking a bit of literary license), or from the oral tradition itself.It's also interesting to me to see the parallels between many of these stories and folk tales from other cultures. For example, many cultures around the world have a version of the Cinderella tale. This seems to support, perhaps, the Jungian read, though perhaps it also speaks to cultural sharing and influence. It's hard to know what the original oral versions of these tales might have been, and how much has been changed over time.  In terms of literary interpretations of the fairy tales, I'd definitely recommend the novel Possession by A.S. Byatt. One of the characters is an 19th century English Victorian poet who writes her own versions of fairy tales, definitely influenced by Grimms.  ;It is also my understanding that while the Grimms compiled oral tales, they put a bit of their own spin on them for their own purposes, or at least consistent with German romanticism movement. As I understand it, they also were dealing with varying versions of the same tales and had to pick and choose what to include. It's also interesting reading different translations of Grimm tales. The first translation I read was by Padraic Colum, which I'd recommend. It seems somewhat less adorned and more matter of fact than the Lucy Crane, but of course also doesn't have the same evocative illustrations. One thing I've heard and reflected on is that the original stories (partly as reflected in the Colum translation) are very matter of fact about the things that happen. Life was quite arbitrary and could be cruel. Children who strayed in the forest could be eaten by wolves, sickness could carry people away quite randomly. One thing that strikes me about fairy tales is how both the fantastic and the horrible are related and accepted without comment. One thing I did note in the Crane translation was a bit more of an overlay of morality. That bad things happen to bad people, rather than the more arbitrary kind of fate that may hang over the earlier stories. Perhaps a touch of English Victorian morality? But I've also heard that the Grimms gave a bit of this kind of overlay as well. It's hard to know without being privvy to the original oral versions. Another thing I notice is a kind of merciless treatment of foolishness or distraction. Poor Clever Else -- that kind of cleverness (looking for trouble when none is around, day dreaming instead of working) was not to be tolerated. You can sometimes peel back the veils -- it seems to me -- and get a glimpse of what life truly must have been like back then living on the edge of the forest, and the edge of subsistence and violence.  ;"

I'd HIGHLY recommend anyone watching Spirited Away if you've not yet done so. My Neighbor Totoro is also wonderful (for younger kids especially), as is Castle in the Sky...any of his movies really.  I would also note that I see a lot of influences in Miyazaki's work - it's interesting how he combines motifs from European fairy tales with traditional Japanese motifs. For me, Zeniba (the sister who lives in the country - I may be confusing them) reminds me of Baba Yaga from Russian fairy tales - and I love the train ride through the watery landscape - and the music really adds to the mood.;I read a lot of children's literature to my own kids. I've noticed that a lot of books written for children, especially recently, can be pretty forgettable. But the books my children like best tend to be ones that may not fit into the definition of Children's Literature that the lecture laid out. Plenty of books -- classics for children -- don't have simplified vocabulary and the meaning can work on a variety of levels. The plots may also be complicated, and far from episodic. Maybe it's just rereading them as adults, but I'm often impressed with the style, narrative structure, and treatment of alternative realities and fantasy elements. I'm thinking of books such as  Peter Pan, Princess and the Goblin, Tom's Midnight Garden, Children of Green Knowe  or  Wind in the Willows. I'd also include a lot of books in the New York Review of Books Children's Classics series.  Maybe it's just because I am rereading them as an adult that I see all of the layers -- time passing and mortality seem to hang over many of them, as does the fallibility of adults. But the vocabulary is also pretty advanced. I think it's a disservice to children and writers both to say you need simplistic plots, simplistic language and happy endings to engage children. In the lecture, Professor Rabkin mentions that the children addressed in children's lit are those we want to believe we have. We want to see children a certain way. But I think children get more of the darkness and ambiguity in life than we may think they do. I'm speaking more of 8-12 year olds, though, not of little kids. But it's interesting to reread some of the books that were my own favorites when I was a kid. They all have a dark thread, or ambiguities to them I must have picked up on as a child.  I do think there's a huge difference between picture books and books for older elementary school, however.   I'd be interested in what other people think.  ;As someone who always has been intrigued by the personal story of Mary Shelley, without ever actually reading Frankenstein, the chance to finally be made to read this novel was one of the attractions of the course. I have to say I am disappointed. I get that she's trying to make the creature more appealing than Frankenstein himself, but really -- 60% into the novel -- I have little patience for either. I don't buy that the creature obtained such a world view just through overhearing a reading of the classics. I don't believe that his feelings for humanity changed so abruptly for the worse. The writing feels so superficial to me -- the worthy, disenfranchised French family, the simple but intolerant peasants, the wily, untrustworthy Turkish merchant. I find myself getting very annoyed through the whole thing. I keep waiting to be surprised. Maybe it's my modern sensibility, but I'm trying to understand why this novel has had so much resonance. It seems to wear its message so close to its sleeve. I find myself missing Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein;  a little comic relief would be welcome. I was thinking Dracula would be the chore to read, but it felt more multi-dimensional than this. Frankenstein just feels like an allegory. Maybe I'm not reading it carefully enough?  ;"

I'd last an hour. Maybe. And then probably die of an infected toenail. ;) That seems to be a common criticism of GRRM - that the nihilism of the world is just for the sake of it at times. For some, that drives people away... for me, it just adds to the draw of the story and the interesting characters.    As a writer, I find myself drawn to that use of an unreliable narrator for every chapter. I think it has to be used with great artistry and planning in mind, as there has to be a purpose in using it as a device to progress the story. It can't be done for just the sake of it - which I fear others may attempt to do... still, I would love to dabble with this, but the planning involved is mind-blowing. My favorite character? That is a tough one. I find myself very much enjoying Tyrion's chapters. And Jamie became very entertaining once he became a chapter character. Arya is a very interesting character... and I look forward to seeing her journey being translated on the show. Sansa's chapters get very interesting later on in the series, so that is pretty compelling. In the show, I just feel bad for her. But yeah, I think I'd have to say that Tyrion is my overall favorite. Not very surprising, huh? ;That was pretty much my impression, too. There are probably other elements at work here - a nod to materialism and living in the present, but first off, it is established that he is a fool - he just isn't aware of it. The reader is.

I sometimes had a difficult time reading the books because of all the blatant violence against women and had to put the book down for a few weeks. I think, however, that the political intrigue is spot on and entertaining. My favorite characters are Dany, Tyrion, and Arya because they are balanced in their view of morality and survival, which is why their characters have lasted so long while others that see the world as black or white have died. On a side note, if you enjoyed or enjoy reading The Song of Fire and Ice series, I suggest reading the Wheel of Time series. It's much longer (I believe it's 14 books), but it's less consistently violent and the author actually does a better job of embodying the characters in their separate narratives (including calling certain characters different names in the narrative, not just the dialogue). It also has very strong female characters that are all perceptively different. It also has strong political intrigue that makes you want to keep reading.

Young women were also far more vulnerable than they are today, as they had to fear dangers such as lustful men, and the shame associated with having a child out of wedlock. As long as we look at these fables, keeping in mind the societal paradigms of the era, the brothers Grimm would be gald, as they had done their job.

It was about a sense of belonging and feeling part of a nation. Many Germanic peoples were subject to rule by others - such as those under the Austro-Hungarian (Habsburg) empire. The same is the case for Italy. Both Italy and Germany became countries in their own right in the late nineteenth century so the Grimm Tales are just part of the art created in this period that reflected a national pride and a sense of 'German-ness' before the creation of an actual German state.   It is easy with the benefit of hindsight and what we know of the horrors of National Socialism under the Nazis to credit the Grimm Tales with a different agenda to what they originally had. This is dangerous ground and we need to understand stories in the context in which they were written. Of course it's equally valid to look at the influence of stories on future generations and this is where the morals and politics of the time of reading (such as when Nazis were gaining ground) would come into play.I think nationalism has gained a negative connotation, largely due to right wing extremists such as the Nazis, but it's important to remember that it also means patriotism and loyalty to one's country and this is probably closer to the original meaning of the word at the time the Grimm Brothers were writing.  ;"

Thanks. This tale (and others in the similar vein of the bad winning over the good) bothered me at first.  I was expecting the tales to teach a moral, as the ""sanitized"" versions of the tales that have been handed down to our generation do.  The tales that show the cheater winning (clever gretel, Hans, to name a few) caused me to morally flinch.  But if the purpose of the tales is to teach children human nature in all of its complexities, then I begin to see the alcoholic, the loyal mother, the wayward lost soul, the cunning trickster, and on and on.  Then, I find it a pity that we are not giving children of today the same life lessons.. Instead,, they get the happily ever after morality, where the good girl is rewarded and the bad punished.  Frankly, life doesn't usually happen that way.  Kids could use more of the original material. ;I note that when things occur in threes in the stories, the first two times are passed by then the third is acted apon in the case of resisting an impulse, or something happens in the case of something being revealed.

I didn't pick up on any ""seducing"" so much as manipulation. At no point did she express feelings of any kind for the rabbit- most of the story seemed about control and abuse. The rabbit threatened her, by making it clear that he would continue to consume them, by consuming their source of sustenance. (their garden) I never spotted any desire on her part, only sadness.;I agree, the wedding guests emphasized how isolated she was from her mother, her home. I was surprised by how recognizable the methods of abuse were seeing as it is such an old story.  ;I weep in sorrow and joy. I've cried out of anger, and pain, and surprise.The rain during a hurricane is the same rain that falls soft in spring, it just feels different.;Has anyone else felt uneasy while combing through The Rabbit Bride?  It's a grimm tale, so of course it's dark, but I found this one especially creepy. (and creepier still, each time I read it again.)So mother and  daughter live in this garden. (a haven, a perfect place. symbolic of purity, beauty, innocence. ex: the garden of eden, the secret garden)The rabbit is a he/his/him: if I were to replace the word rabbit, the fitting word is man, not boy. The girl however, is always girl, maiden, and then bride. She is a child. The rabbit instructs her ""come, maiden. sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit-hutch."" which is obviously sexual.  Day two he returns, repeats. This is a threat- you comply or I consume. (destroy their garden, they have nothing= the rabbit will take her life.)  If anyone else saw disney's beauty and the beast as a child, the rabbit reminds me of gaston- a man who pursued a girl by threatening to put her father away. It wears the mask of persistent courting, but is driven by the rabbit's desire to possess the girl. He leaves her no other option but to be his bride.I noticed something odd and I'm unsure if it's a result of german to english translation, but thought it worth pointing out. A rabbit hutch is a cage or box, whereas a rabbit den or hole is their home in the wild. If it's   intentional, it fits the rabbit's treatment of her as a thing for him to have/keep.Those were some of the bits I found most interesting, would seriously love to hear other viewpoints.  (also: the ending held the most meaning for me. she escaped and in her place left the rabbit...a thing. an object. a doll.);I'm not sure I agree that the doll as something to be loved. The phantom (if I recall correctly) is a character with a surplus of emotion that drives his desire to possess a beautiful girl, so that she can't leave him. his disfigurement and isolation push him to obsession. He feels genuine love. The rabbit however, did not seem to care about the bride he'd broken, but that his bride was ruined(dead). Whether it was a doll or a girl did not seem to matter much.;oops, didn't mean to post it under general discussions.  ;I agree that she was lonely, but I who specifically did she disobey? What were her duties? I can understand the running away part, though it could be that she was simply following her mother's instructions to get rid of the rabbit. I'm unsure when it comes to placing responsibility on the girl, with her mother's instructions in one ear, and the rabbit's demands in the other.

I also see it as a metaphor for careless or hasty sexual relationships and warning against the perils of such.  In Six Soldiers of Fortune, however, I found it more difficult to find meaning further than 'be careful of judging others' and 'be careful of making bargains you may not want to/be able to keep'.

By any chance does anyone know the author of either story, or which type of folklore they are from? A book title containing either story would be really helpful if anyone knows.;Thanks! I always seem to forget that Wikipedia exists for some reason.;Also, did anyone else think of the deathly hallows from the Harry Potter books when they were reading 'The Raven'? The stick, the cloak and the horse?  Along with the three spots of blood on the handkerchief in 'The Goose Girl' , are three's special in some way? Is it a device of some sort? I know that three is a special number in that humans are more likely to remember or respond to things in threes, like political soundbites and such, so is this just random, arbitrary number choice or is a group of three, or a trinity even, meaningful in some way?  Edit: I have just read 'Cat and Mouse In Partnership, and the cat actually mentions 'Good things come in threes..' in the story. I am wondering if there is a religious influence, considering the time of writing/transcribing. This would also possibly go toward explaining the way that some stories seem to be thickly veiled parables for adult situations/behaviour.  I just found the thread on threes, sorry this is in the wrong place.;It would be fascinating to know which stories were written by the brothers, if any. It would be fun to compare them with collected tales. What a lovely idea.;This was one of my thoughts too...a 'selfishness leads to destruction type moral.' But then I also thought of it as 'ignorance will lead to destruction' when the cock et al blindly do random tasks before receiving help and this could also be a 'too many cooks spoil the broth' type message. However when I really look at it, it seems to become a microcosm for life. The food chain shown in the animals, or 'mourners', the ignorance of the hen who choked being perpetuated by every other character in the story until, at the end, everybody dies. That is basically how life works if you strip it down to the basics. in a very pessimistic way.;Thanks so much for this! I have no doubt that this will help people out.;A course on the historic period of these tales would be amazing. I feel like so much more could be gotten from many stories just by placing them in their original context. Not much, even one short lecture on the specific time period in which a book was written would be at the very least interesting. A 15 minute video discussing the period   of each of the books we are going to cover would be fantastic in helping draw out both conscious and subconscious influences and ideas. If only such videos existed. I love the thought of learning some of those 'for a specific reason' tales.;I think of it like this.. we have jerry springer/jeremy kyle/oprah etc to see the problems other people have in their lives, plus we live in very open and accepting times. Now, (and this is the first modern day vaguely similar lifestyle I could find) imagine an Amish kid, raised by very religious, very moral parents who want to protect their kid from temptations. This stuff is very likely the type of 'life lessons' that type of kid gets growing up, while the secular population get theirs from the modern world, media, tv, music etc. I think people back when these were written/transcribed most likely were either religious, or watchful of their words and actions BECAUSE of religion, and the influence on perceived morality would have been huge even in the most basic terms.  ;Hi, I have not yet finished the entire book, and I am just having ideas that may or may not be correct, simply another interpretation.   I will try to explain my line of thinking on the religion thing. So, the first indicator for me, was the way in which some stories are so heavily veiled that the 'hidden'   meaning or parable can be completely missed by most readers at first glance. This reminded me of the way that strict religion can impart wisdom on themes that may be distasteful to their moral viewpoint ( promiscuity in 'The Rabbit's Wife', or the protection afforded by the three drops of blood in 'The Goose Girl as a metaphor for menstruation, meaning the female is 'safe' and protected from pregnancy) and also, the recurring symbolism invoked by the trinity, or groups of three as a metaphor for the holy trinity, ( the three miraculous items needed to ascend the glass mountain leading to the reward of saving the princess as a metaphor for the trinity of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit leading to the reward of eternal life and Heaven). Threes are also seen as a good thing in some of the other stories. I am still reading so there may well be more of this. I used the example of an Amish child being taught life lessons because it is the strictest religious modern lifestyle I could think of that would come close to the type of communities people must have lived in at the time these stories were transcribed.;Hi, I too am reading the pdf version and I felt exactly the same at first. It IS a chore to read a book in pdf format, but the stories are not as lame as they seem. Can I suggest you look at the discussion thread on the first story, 'The Rabbit's Wife'? You may be surprised by some of the meanings that folks have derived from that one simple, seemingly meaningless tale. If you are still not interested in analysing the Grimm Tales after looking through that discussion fair enough. I only suggest you have a look in case you were too distracted/annoyed by the crappy format to analyse at all. It certainly has made it less of a chore for me although the stories are still boring, it's more the symbolism and hidden meanings that have made it enjoyable.  ;Congratulations! I think it is great that you are preparing so thoroughly for University, well done for getting in :);I think that there is a victimisation of men who dare interact with prepubescent and/or teenage girls. He may very well have been a paedophile but there is absolutely no evidence to support that claim. Innocence and beauty can be captivating and inspiring without necessarily being sexual, and as for the photographs it has been said repeatedly that the poses were what was fashionable and popular at that period in time. Maybe the little girl was his muse and nothing more.;For those struggling with their kindle's, the kindle for pc app is maybe a slightly better option for some. It can be difficult to read an entire book on your pc, but being able to go back and forth seems far easier on a pc than the kindle. It may be worth a try.

Maybe people do not realise that they have the ability to give feedback as a reader, maybe they feel unqualified to comment, maybe they're just lazy or have no time. Either way, I think the professor could include a little bit of advice regarding feedback, to reassure those who are uncomfortable commenting.  Maybe we could start a thread where those needing more feedback can post their essay to be reviewed by people who feel comfortable doing it? Since it can be done anonymously I think it is a good idea, especially since some people got far less feedback than others.;Do you guys think it would be helpful for a reviewer to state what mark they gave in the comments section? If it is helpful to folks, then maybe we can ask that people do that? It wouldn't reach everyone, but it might help a little if at least some reviewers left a note of the score.

I wonder if JKRowling was familiar with that story. ;Re: Christian influence on the tales' morals, I definitely saw a parallel between the beheading of the twins in Faithful John and the God's command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in Genesis. Personally I find it morally inexcusable to kill a child in either case, but it does make sense within a values system that exalts faith and obedience to a higher power above all else. In Faithful John, all of the King's prior problems had been caused by his reluctance to trust John's word. I think it entirely possible that John is a stand in for the Judeo-Christian god in this story. ;They are incredibly sanitized in many cases--- I believed for most of my life that the Grimm's stories were the Real Original Thing-- and about the darkest versions of the tales you were going to get. I was in for quite a surprise when I traced the history of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" -- it is taken from a much older tale in which the princess is raped in her sleep by a married king and only awakens months later after unconsciously delivering his twins. When she goes to find him, his jealous wife tries to boil her alive in oil... I was a bit taken aback to say the least. ;Definitely... Desirability is subjective. A bottle of water is worth more than a million dollars if you haven't had a drink in days. Hans figures out what he needs at the moment, and is willing to give it up when it no longer applies... I can think of a lot of people who hoard things they don't need because they might want them again someday, and all those things eventually become a burden to take care of, much like Han's stones. ;I had the same reaction... I started out irritated by the story but by the end was very charmed by it.  ;I don't think it matters that Hans never explicitly states this philosophy. Fairy tale characters often simply embody a certain trait or virtue, without breaking down exactly why they are doing what they're doing for the audience. ;I remember another similar Grimm's story that I don't think is in our reading (though I'm only 3/4 of the way through), where the Father cuts off his daughter's hands in order to get out of a deal he'd made with the devil. Now I'm wondering if the mutilation of daughters, specifically their hands, is a common element in folk tales... ;I agree with some of the posts here suggesting that there is an element of budding sexuality/puberty at play in the girl's decision to go with the rabbit. Because of their excessive fertility, rabbits have long been used to represent a vital sex drive ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_and_hares_in_art ). However, the same vitality and passion that can make one an appealing sex partner can also sometimes fuel aggressive and temperamental behavior (his bullying of the girl). ;Interesting... I hadn't even thought about the symbolism of the cabbage patch before. I was too focused on the rabbit. :-) That ties a lot of these themes together very neatly right from from the start- if the rabbit represents the male and the cabbage patch represents the female, and the first thing we learn in the story is that the mother fears that rabbit is a danger to the cabbage patch... ;Taking a little inspiration from the Bride and Switch thread here, I also wanted to talk about a TvTrope I was reminded of when reading The Brother And Sister-  No Ontological Inertia http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia It references, among other things, the preponderance of stories that involve spells breaking once the original spellcaster is gone- ie the fawn becoming human again once the witch is executed. This is definitely not the first time I've seen a fairy tale appeal to this rule of magic, and I was wondering why. Is it just a convenient plot device to secure a happy ending, or is there a deeper significance? Anyway, I just wanted to open the floor to opinions because I wasn't really sure myself... I did have a sort of fuzzy idea that it was related to religion in some way- there are lots of stories going back to the ancient world showing God/the gods putting constant effort into keeping the world running on a day to day basis (Apollo's daily chariot ride, for example)- and that maybe magic is supposed to work in a similar way to divine power. But I don't know. ;It wouldn't be the first time... In the Bible, Eve and Adam are punished for eating fruit that they have been told will make them like God. Arachne is punished for bragging that her weaving is better than the goddess Athena's even though a weaving contest between the two shows that this is actually true.  However, I wouldn't discount the greed angle entirely- looking to seize divine power could very well be read as the ultimate form of greed. Alternately, you could say that the story shows that material wealth and success can go to people's head and make them believe that they truly are/deserve to be like gods (there are many reak world examples throughout history of the rich and powerful behaving this way). ;"

I'm wondering why the more-or-less-ten authors studied in this class are the ones who are studied. Everybody (I suppose) can add very famous authors in this list.

Also, it is important to consider, as a prof, that the students do not have the same level of reading skills, understanding or rate of learning. In other words, we could be ""sitting"" next to a guy who writes sf novels for a living or next to a guy who is actually just trying to begin a more active reading lifestyle. Thus, this can make it a bit complex from the standpoint of the teachers (I am assuming).As for the works themselves, I believe ancient mythology and storytelling is quintessential to the well-versed mind of a fiction writer / reader, but there are several factors to consider. First of all, time. We can spend an entire decade studying fiction from the early beginnings of man to our modern era and we would not be even close to finishing. Secondly, because relatively ""modern"" tales and stories are more into context with our contemporary world. It is no easy task to have a full, in-depth analysis of Dracula which considers the psychological, sociological and cultural impact on western culture and writing. But it is something completely different to have this same analysis on a work like The Odyssey, where the context of Greek culture and history is basic to the understanding of the story. Therefore, relatively modern stories are more accessible (and I use this term loosely) from a contextual point of view.This is of course, just my wild guess on the selection of the tales for the course. ;1.

We have not 'golden bird' - we have the Fire Bird. It's shining like a sun, but not burn. It's some kind of phoenix and it definitely is the simbol of the sun. But not the simbol of the richness directly.Story the tale of the brothers Grimm about golden bird is identical to the Russian tale about the Fire Bird. Only instead of a fox we have   wolf (and it is also a deep symbolism) )))About colors. Maybe someone would be interested. In Russian we have 2 color (two diferent) for English 'blue'. Even in the rainbow, 'Sinij' = blue, 'goluboj' = light-blue, or sky-blue. The 'golubuj' is a The Sky color, but The Sea is 'sinij'. As far as I know, this blue-division is only in Russian language. And I don't know why. In Serbian lang there is 'plavi' that means 'no-red'. It may be blue - and it may be light-yellow. Blond-hair girl they call 'plavusha', and it may be means 'blue-haired' girl also. This is (as I was hear) very old color system: white (purity), black (dirty or death), red (not white not black, but beautiful - 'red girl' means 'beautiful girl') and 'not red, but not white and black' - 'plavi', or blue. It's like 'The One', 'The One and its Opposite', 'The Three' (white-black-red) and 'The Three plus something else'.;In Russian tradition ""red"" means ""beautiful"". Red girl, red square, red sun - even red death. Russian proverb: ""before your own folk even death is red"". So ""red cap"" strongly correspond to ""beautiful  cap"", or girl. Wolf in the Russian tradition is not just a symbol of ""sexual predator"". Wolf is a simbol of wild evil,  man-eater, sometimes stupid, but not sexual. Something that must be killed in any case or its kill and devours you. Not simple kill, but break you into pieces. Wolf is the enemy, robber.In this simbols system, we have another view on this tale. The little  beautiful  girl (child) meets in the dark wild forest a men-eater...  stupid mother who sends her child in the dangerous forest all alone...  where for some unknown reason lives a grandma...The language of symbols should be clear for the people of this culture as the common language and if you use another simbol's system...So the view of professor's was very unexpected and funny for me. ""The Red Cap"" as a sexual thriller...But this view have some (many!) logic inside, and it  has the right to exist. In this system, everything becomes clear.Though  I think that some strories is not worth dig too deep :);"

All western modern fantasy ""follow the White Rabbit"".All these books create a language of symbols, by wich modern writers is spoken. Western writers, I mean. Russian fantasy wolrd is a little different, we have some another roots. Some common, though.;Fist of all: I thing it must be read in English.This book was translated into Russian by many famous Russian writers (including A. P. Chekhov and V.V. Nabokov). Pesonaly I like the translation of B. Zakhoder and not like translation of Nabokov. Both of them not translated but trying re-tale ""Alice"". But Zahoder in fact translate it, Nobokov re-tale. So Nabokov version is not Carrol book but Carrol and Nabokov, more Nabokov for my opinion.Zakhoder translated book after ""25 years of reading in English,"" and ""it was his favorite book"". So his translation very good, very near to original by spirit. But not for language. Not so light, not so ""nonsenceless"" - not childish, though Zakhoder was the perfect children's writer (which I loved).I think it's impossible translate Carroll's books, like poetry (although   verses translated perfectly by S. Marshak).The English version lighter, brighter, more cheerful, more funny.Russian are usually afraid to read in the original, because even in translation a lot of new words. ""Read in English? No, not ""Alice""! There, even Russian version make me dizzy!""But read in English more lighter than Russian, I think.To read the ""Frankenstein"" is much more difficult.;Sorry, by the way. There was very good audio-version of ""Alice in Wonderland"", on a vinyl-disk, with songs of V. Vysotsky. The spirit of this version is just like in original book, very close. But it is not translation and not a book. As a child, I was not very fond of the book (Russian translation), but this vinyl record was one of my favorites. I think many Russian people can say also.;I've read some about vampires ...I used to think that vampires descent from western legends, Western Europe. German, may be, but certainly not the Slavic. Werewolfs is Slavic, true, that there is a lot proofs and explanations. Enough to say that the Byzantine chronicles the battle cry of the ancient Slavs was howling.We have some legends about 'vurdalak', this is some mixture vimpires and zombies, very nasty thing. But not vimpires (as I thought).But then I found out that vampires are purely Slavic legend, the Serbian. And that cases of vampirism documentary recorded in Western Serbia. In this year in Western Serbia was even declared a state of alarm, because  a one famous vampire, Sava Savanovi  , it woke up. The Serbs, as it says in Wikipedia, have inherited this legend from Iranian tribes.... or it may be Tatarian...In short, the ancestor of Count Dracula was an old evil witch who attacked the brave riders (Iranian or Tatarian) and bit them in the heel.   And through the heel sucking their blood so so that they could not ride (I do not really understand the connection between the heel and the ride)So if you want to escape from the vampires take care of heels greater than the neck.

These thoughts came to me after reading ""Frankenshtain"".The monster of Frankenshtein is like Golem. Frankenshtain studied the works of the famous alchemist - Agrippa etc. In the Alchemia was (and is) one strange simbol - the white hare. This is simbolic name for mercury.Mercury was one of the important component for production of the Philosopher's Stone. And alchemists usualy wrote some important recipes in allegory. This was the defence from a fools.So, the White Rabbit of Lewis Carroll... Alice grew up and shrunken down... Materials increases with heating and decreases with cooling...May be ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a recipe for production of the Philosopher's Stone? May be Lewis Carroll got it?I think - yes! Yes, he got it! And after he got it he presented it to Alice!He was a photographer!""White rabbit"" is a light. Rabbit hole is the diaphragm of camera. The image of Alice Alice went through the hole ""white rabbit"" and long time fall   (this was the ancient way of taking a photo). White rabbit has a clock... to keep track of how long it is necessary to fall. And the diaphragm turns the image, change the top and bottom.Further Alice (her image) increased (heated),   decreased (cooling), gone to the ""salt lake of tears"" with faitytales animals... That means with some chemical elements... The ""mouse"" is a name for arsenicum, for example. Russian name for arsenicum is a ""myshjak"", mean ""mouse-er"", is was used for kill mouses. Lewis Carroll was in Russia, made some photo there, he used to play with word and language...After ""solt lake"" Alice dried, pressed in white rabbit's house, sprinkled by ""pebbles""... Photographic plate is ready for printing!For printing you must choose the right size (not large not small, the mushroom help)...Wait 5 hours impatiently (with March Hare)...By the way, ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" They are both black in black-white photo. And, if you want make a good photo you must somehow divide its. May be eyes of real Alice was bronw? With black pupil of course.""Painting roses"" means retouching, and, and after all procedures - the photo of Alice, at the end of the hand-written book, presented to her.May be she asked him how he makes photos? And he told her about it in a fairy tale's style, as for a child.;Why ""white rabbit""?In the Alchemia ""white hare"" is a simbol for mercury - an element. ""Mercury"" is a God's name. Mercury God are The Spirit of the Alchemia, the main spirit and the Teacher for all alchemists - Mercurius ter Maximus. The Light is a main part, The Spirit of photos. Making photos means ""drowing by only light"". So The Light, the ""white rabbit"", for photograhers equals Mercury for alchemists.;But raven may be white, too ))If you're trying to make picture from photoplate you must be very accurately with time and chemicals reagents. If you make a mistake a similar colors (in black-white case) will be seen equal. Brown and black will be seen like black, or like gray. It you trying to make photo-portrait you should pay special attention to the eyes. If eyes are dark (brown) to make its ""live"" on picture a very difficult task. Especially in those days.So, if you want to solve this problem... What can you do, how can you do? How can you split these colors? Brown like color of writing-desk, black like color of raven... Why is a raven like a writing-desk? Where is the error in the process?;Google translated badly.  ;What do you think, whether Victor had the right to kill the monster?

And The Missis of The Mountain gave them some presents (though there was a strong rivalry between she and his fiancee).Stories like but a meanings are completely different.

Russian ""Master"" not means ""House-holder"" or holder something, or Lord, or boss. Russian ""master"" means ""very skillful craftsman"", or craftsman, whose craft became the art.These was (pity but not ""is"", hope that ""will"") very famous and respectful people. We can said even about ""cult of master"" in Russian - in the Russain Impire and USSR both, informal and implicit, though.There is a old russian proverb: ""he is a master from God"". So ""master"" is a man whose hands the God managing Himself. Master can, must and do the miracles. This is his function. Craft-miracles, I mean.Master is not saint, not even religious. But he has inspiration from God, inside him there is the God's spirit of creation. He may be bad after the act of creation (even very bad), but not in process. In the process of creation he have God's spirit. If that master trying repeat the Nature or even exceed the Nature - Nature itsef helps him (by nature spirits like the Missis of The Copper   Mountain in ""The Stone Flower"").   But he may be strange. Actually, then he have some inspiration, he must be strange. Other people can misunderstand he but only as long as he will show them the result.So, the Owen Warland was a real master. He was strange, he definitely had inspiration, he was very skillful craftsman and he was trying to make a miracle. And he done it. But nobody helps him, he lost his life, lost his love and his miracle was crushed. That means (from me) the other people was monsters. They was totally blind, and even the child could not feel the God Spirit in this miracle.There is another think. If craftsman is a master the God is behind his shoulder. That means: if he is a REAL master, all his doings have God's inspiration - that is Life, or Spirit. The Frankenstain's monster have a live - he was a God's creation, God's miracle. If a master is selfish, or money-lover, or etc his creation can't be live. It can't be the art even. It can't have God inside. If you ""have the God is behind your shoulder"" then you are doing something - this something must have the spirit, or live. Then it have the spirirt - it is not your creation, it is the miracle for all people, even for you. The fact you done it means you CAN have God's inspiration, but not have it all times. If you are proud you done it and make it live yourself you are very stupid - but you can have this inspiration anything. And people known about you can have.This is the moral. This is a not main russian archetype, it is not official but is deep and folk. Now, in our time, the ""cult of master"" sounds like non-fanny joke.   But it is there, as archetype. ;http://www.amazon.com/Malachite-Casket-Tales-Pavel-Bazhov/dp/1589637313/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373541192&sr=1-1&keywords=bazhov   - book in Amazonhttp://lastochka-fromrussiawithlove.blogspot.ru/2009/03/tales-of-malachite-casket-hostess-of.html - this is that story (not sure is a good translate)http://www.4to40.com/folktales/index.asp?p=The_Malachite_Casket - the extensionThis is not a fairy tales.

On  unnderstanding rituals I like and recommend"" The Golden Bough: A Study of Magic and Religion by James George Frazer"" ;I am sorry for interruptions , but back to Propp . The name of one of the works is "" Historical roots of the fairytale"" it is giving the base to see and interpret all symbols and structure as a complex not separately , and you really can see time levels. .  You can look at this as at the history of the human nature and mind , and that is why just a list of some findings not enriching us at all. The problem is WHY we are still repeating this patterns.And, yes the answer: it is all about ancient rituals. As a Halloween. Memory of  the childhood of the Society.  ;I will not say I have studied Propp. I just read few of his books when I was 12-13 years old an this was a long time ago. But 3 of his main works are very interesting : Morphology of the Fairytale, Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale and Ritual Laughter in the Folklore.( translation of the titles mine, mean  :not good). In the first work he is brilliantly analyzing the structure of the fairytale, on second scrupulously showing connections between every detail of the fairytale and details of the initiation ritual and in the third bringing a new idea of the sacred laughter.          I am not very good with Internet search and I did not find second and third books in English translation, but the first, "" Morphology"" looks popular enough . P. S.  And in the  Historical Roots of the Magic Fairytale , Propp working a lot of with Frazer' s materials.  P.P.S.

Us for me a Blue Beard sound as a contemporary composition about a serial killer.(  Just joking). ;According to  Propp it will be not FROM the Garden of Eden but TO the Garden of Eden,   and the hole will be associated with grave- entrance to the other world.            All Alice pattern repeating classic  preCristian stories, which in its own turn repeating the pattern of the initiation rituals( think Grim's Mother Snowbed: Fall in a well and instead dying finding the magic land , traveling there, meeting supernatural characters and returning back to the earth more strong , more rich or even with some extra power. )          But each new time level adding a new meaning to the old pattern.  ( As Professor Rabkin pointing on association with Garden of Eden, not The Land of Ancestors).           All of this repetitions  unintentional , just using century proved powerful structure to deliver own ideas to the audience. It is just an old  good carriage for the new fruits. If Greg will use the same pattern for his work ,it does not mean he want to convince  his young readers to believe in a power of spirits, just people always will eat  familiar food, better than green eggs and hem.

Although, red color can be inserted into this logic(red - day - life - giving new life), I don't think that it has so much to do with noon in a subconsious.

As you may know, most of Coursera courses close access to materials, including assignments, after the class is over. That's really sad, especially, for courses that are not just quiz-based. In this class, we'll have a lot of written assignments and losing them will not be awesome.Motivation. I noticed that once I create Cert, I feel that I need to work much harder on course because my friends, family will see the results of my work. So, it's not just about me and certificate after the class. It's about putting a lot of effort to have something substantial to show off later. Thus, much more thorough learning happens during the course.Here's example of my Cert for Developing Innovative Ideas:  https://www.accredible.com/570.

Feel free to ask :)Best wishes,Roxy.;I remember that in childhood Grimm's tales were not my favourite(Anderson's were), but still these stories excited imagination and I was allured to them. However, the tales I read were not as dark as original versions we read now but no were they soft, innocence adaptations for children. What do I think for these dark stories with witches, ravens, blood, death being introduced to children?I think, fairy tales today have two main purposes:introducing kids to the world in a illustrative, exciting manner and teaching the first lessons/morals;enrich imagination and entertain;When it comes to the first purpose, dark stories may not be perfect but still they are much better than naive adaptations in that - the world is not perfect and it will never be, children may experience some inner problems that they won't be aware of or ready to talk to adults. Dark stories help kids a) to realize that world is not always fair in an illustrative, playful manner; b) cope with stresses, problems they won't discuss with adults. Yes, definitely, there should be trust between kid and parent but sometimes it's not achievable.Personal example: I had very tough childhood with parents being divorced and me living with neither of them, feeling outsider at kindergarten and school(since all of my peers had families). Two fairy tale stories that helped me to ""survive"" this time and most likely mitigate the psychological trauma were not happy adaptations of originals, even though they were not dark:  Ugly Duckling  by Christian Andersen and I don't remember the second except plot(girl had a chance to choose whether she would be poor and miserable and suffer in the beginning of life but live good life later or vice verse). As a kid, I used main characters as ""role models"" and since both of them had happy ends, ""surviving"" was much easier.  I can't say so much onto the second point. I guess, eliminating all the darkness from the stories will do more harm than good because darkness is an important part of human nature as well as it's alluring for all the ages. Maybe, it's just part of who we are. Maybe, kids need to face and be aware of these dark moments to fight the further fears as the heroes of fairy tales. However, I believe that original stories like we had this week are not suitable for kids. It's all about golden mean.;Peer-reviews enhance one's learning. That's a fact. But self-assessment after the peer-reviews can help to make one's works better because after seeing other's mistakes or perfect works, a person can give her/himself a good feedback, seeing the own work with a new perspective.This course is awesome, and the only one that seems to be missing is the ability to self-assess yourself after peer-evaluation.

Lack of realism, exaggeration, brevity, and darkness are all separate comments you haven't integrated. I suggest next time pick one idea, such as lack of realism, then provide multiple examples to make your argument stronger. Maybe you could have found more examples of lack of realism besides the animals and exaggeration instead of going off onto other ideas, or you could have discussed more than one story.Finally, I don't buy that Grimm's fairy tales are less realistic than modern stories, and why is it their lack of realism that makes them similar to folk tales?

You could have easily written about all of the  Hen/Cock stories in the anthology.

I remember in  The White Snake how the  servant was perfectly willing to sacrifice his horse to feed the ravens. Didn't the horse protest?;Your essay was very interesting to read, and took some thinking about. As Martha says, paragraphs and white space would help. 300 words is a short paragraph in a longer work, but in a shorter work like this multiple paragraphs make it more aesthetically pleasing. You should also cite Gibert Durand, and remove the contractions. Finally there are some awkward places with poor grammar. (""According to"", not  ""In according to"";  ""might be understood,"" not ""might be understanding.""  Enough with the criticisms on writing style though, your content is powerful. I feel I understand the story on such a deeper level after reading your essay. Dual symbolism is an interesting tool, and I think your choices really hit the meaning beyond the story. Thank you for posting.  I do wonder about the clock though. What does the dual symbolism  of maternity and death say about how the only surviving gosling hides in a clock? Does the time represent death, or is the clock another womb symbol, where the gosling is released alive to its mother when time is up? Why does the wolf fail to look in the clock?;Thank you for the elaboration. Symbolism is immensely fascinating, and so many people don't understand how it works beneath the surface to influence a reader's thoughts.I'm just realizing I made a mistake when I corrected your grammar. Your sentence should read ""dark symbols might be understood as the faces of death when negatively valued."" I'm sorry if what I said before was confusing, I wasn't thinking.;Hmm... Perfectly good essay (again, I'm not trying to come off as mean, it's a good essay), but at first I wasn't convinced and had to think it through myself before I came to your conclusion. I think your argument works better for Aesop's fables than Grimm's fairy tales. I'm also not sure about your moral for The Rabbit's Bride. The theme that all things have their proper duty and place is very prevalent in Grimm's tales. Maybe the reader is supposed to laugh at the stupid rabbit who thinks he can marry a maiden and have her work for him in his rabbit hutch. The same in  The Death of the Hen. I was kind of distressed at the morbidity of  the story, but it's possible historical readers laughed at the ridiculousness of a cock morning a hen in a human fashion.  I really do think the warning in both of the stories is to not step out of one's place.  You imply in your first sentence that all Grimm's fairy tails have  animal characters. We all know what you mean, but be careful about what your words actually say.  ;Hello Kathryn. Great essay. I know you're limited by the word count, but as your essay is on children in forests, I think it would have been useful to contrast it with adults/animals in forests. I think much of the fear and darkness Grimm has for children in forests is missing in the tales about adults/animals and that would have really strengthened your thesis. Also, I was struck in Red Cap about how the path was an area of safety, it's only when she strays that the girl is in danger.On the writing, I'm not sure why you have single words in quotes.  ;Roberto, you said you were concerned, but your English reads like a native speaker's to me and I'm not sure how peer 2 could tell English was your second language. The few errors didn't jump out to me the first time I read your essay and I think it takes a close reading to see them. And even then they read more like typos than then misconceptions about English. This might have worked against you if I graded your essay though, since I'm inclined to be lenient towards people with English as a second language, but not so much with native speakers.  ;Yes, It is a big deal. In an academic setting plagiarism is taken very seriously. If you get the book thrown at you, an act of plagiarism can get you kicked out of college or ruin your carrier. Even if plagiarizing here isn't linked to repercussions, the mindset makes it a big deal. Andrew is right to be disgusted and the peer reviewer should be ashamed of themselves for their baseless accusations. ;Ah, thanks for the clarification. Plagiarism is a rather touchy subject with me, and I just don't separate the seriousness of plagiarism with the seriousness of an accusation so broadly. As plagiarism is a big deal, I find an accusation a big deal. In this case the peer reviewer assumed guilty with little evidence, and it's unlikely they'll learn because there is no communicating back to them unless they read the forums. The entire situation is just unfortunate. ;I tend not to notice the person, I just read, so it baffled me the first time I heard people had a preference. Both are good, but I suppose I love stream of consciousness so much I'd have to pick 1st.

For Whom the Bell Tolls is the famous example.And what about present tense?;(I tried to fix the grammar with the least amount of changes, sorry if that was  presumptuous)Once upon a time in a land called Coursera, a land of knowledge, wisdom, and assignments, where one could get lost and never find their way out, there was an old myth, telling that one could get out of Coursera's labyrinth if each town had a countdown clock to its destruction date. Distance did not exist at Coursera, anybody could broadcast texts and images for the whole town. However, even after much discussion, the course leaders could not agree on a date of destruction.

Their contents do not require citation in this course. But if you want to bring in more material, you're very welcome. Sharing is good.""  I suggest that people be very wary of marking down for ""outside ideas"" without citations. There is a mixture of people in this class, and people have different standards for what something is that everyone knows. Something that seems a lifted idea may actually be something everyone knows for a different group of people. There are English professors among us. Although if they say something like ""I read once....,"" or ""so-and-so said...,"" then that does need a citation.  ;Brett, you should go to the store and get some orange marmalade right now. Then make toast. Or you could make kolaches. If you can't buy it, it's fairly easy to make from oranges.  Maybe that day by the lake Carroll and the three girls had orange marmalade and ran out? I can't think of anything it would symbolize, and according to the annotated Alice it's taking the jar down and putting it back that's the joke.  ;I haven't watched the lecture yet, and so I can't be sure about the professor's meaning, but even the children's works you list   (Nancy Drew and Encyclopedia Brown)  are episodic. They just divide the episodes into many short volumes. Tons of books for small children use this format (Cam Jansen, Babysitter's Club, Animorphs, etc...). It's also so commonly seen in cartoons (ex. Teletubbies, Scooby Doo, Power Rangers, etc.) that I can only think of a few examples of cartoons for children that don't use the ""pearl necklace"" technique.  Edit- Actually, Animorphs was a poor example. I'll replace that with Amelia Bedelia.;I'll get back to you after I've watched the lectures.;"

Shame on them. I wish people would show more integrity, just because the peer reviews aren't graded doesn't mean it's acceptable to not follow the instructions. ;I'm always surprised that people are so quick to say old texts are  don't stereotype. I feel it is reasonable to assume authors share the viewpoints of their age, and although England had at least abolished slavery by the time Dracula was written, it was a very racist age. If Bram Stoker did not have any racist beliefs, then he was very odd for his time.  I'm not very far into Dracula (I've read it before though), but it does have this sentence, ""The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist."" I suppose we can interpret this as Bram Stoker writing a stereotyping Jonathan Harker, but I feel that is less likely than the simpler answer that Bram Stoker simply believed such things.;It's because Dracula is set in England and I'm uneducated about Bram Stoker. He did seem to spend much of his life in London though. ;I haven't finished the text yet and I'm fairly unwilling to go through it thinking about stereotypes, but stereotypical sections have been brought up. These sections have been explained away using the complicated explanation that Bram Stoker knew the stereotypes were inaccurate, but included them anyway because his character would not. The simpler explanation that Bram Stoker, a member of a very racist age, held these beliefs seems more likely to me. I don't think that idea that Bram Stoker was using them for effect because his readers find foreign people spooky changes this. I'm also not sure what his being Irish and thus a victim of racism has anything to do with it.  Jason, I don't understand your argument. Trying not to interpret the work through today's modern lens is exactly what I'm trying to do.  If I assume it's not stereotypical because modern people know stereotyping is bad, then I'm making that mistake. If read as a modern text, I don't think Dracula comes off as racist at all.  It's only because I know the history (pretty poorly, though, if I get quizzed on actual beliefs I'll fail), that I find stereotypes.  It's not really judging, more recognition.  Please don't let this argument get nasty, it's only interesting to talk about only as long as it doesn't. There is no tone on the internet, if I come across as abrupt or nasty I do not mean it. To sum up my argument, I put the burden of proof on the ""not stereotyping"" side for older texts.  ;Yes, I am stereotyping. It's interesting to think of stereotyping in that sense. Discussion of an author using their own  cultural and historical background as an explanation for their work is  commonplace. I do not feel discussion of racism is irrelevant or  that discrimination is a trite issue. If you really think that I don't  think we have much else to say to each other. While I didn't want to be  rude by ignoring someone who addressed me personally, I'd rather just  stop it here.;Finally got around to watching the lecture. From Greg's description I missed the part where the book can have an overall plot, and so I was wrong to say Animorphs wasn't an example. Animorphs is a perfect example. Although there is an overall plot of the kids (teenagers?) fighting the Aliens, each book has its own contained adventure, just like a pearl on a string. With a bit of editing, many of the contained adventures could be swapped around.I also still kind of consider the Encyclopedia Brown books an example. I'm trying really hard not to be stubborn, but the order of the chapters in Encyclopedia Brown isn't important. In the beginning of each book Encyclopedia Brown is introduced, and then each mystery is its own pearl, although in Encyclopedia Brown the string is almost nonexistent. Encyclopedia Brown stories also do have ""unnecessary"" details, they characters introduced and objects focused on as red herrings to make the mystery less obvious. I'd have to look at the stories, but I'd bet sometimes those things are in sets of three. They accomplish the same thing as a character randomly looking at a flower, they make the story more interesting.However, although I'm inclined to agree with the professor, none of this applies specifically to children's books. It just happens that the pearl of a string metaphor is perfect for series. Does anyone think  Don Quixote or Gulliver's travels might be good example of pearl on a string?;There's a difference between the peer-reviewer having a different opinion from the essayist, and the essayist just being blatantly wrong. It depends on how the essay is written. Do the essays add something to the knowledge? I'd give a high grade to an essay that explained why certain details taken as symbolic are not, but arguing that Alice has no parodies is just poor comprehension.I gave my required 1 to one of the Alice-haters. They weren't arguing for no meaning (I'm not sure what they were arguing for), but their essay showed poor comprehension of the work and of the terms they used. It was also written in that hidden 1st person where all the ""I's"" are replaced with ""the reader,"" and it was assumed ""the reader"" loses patience with Alice as the work goes on.  ;I understand this. The essay I read came off as jarring because the author attributed very personal reactions to ""the reader."" If they had said ""some readers,"" or ""a reader"" I wouldn't have even noticed it.Edit- Again, everything depends on how the individual essay is written.  ;The difference between in-text references and citations isn't clear   to the uninitiated. Although I certainly want to include citations in my own work, I think it's unfair to mark down others for not citing when the instructions said we did not have to.  Can anyone explain to me how MLA in-text citations work for ebooks? I'm more familiar with APA, which doesn't use page numbers, but APA seems inappropriate for this class. It's an ebook's lack of page numbers that's throwing me off. And could you possibly use Dracula as an example? Would something like this be fine?Dracula begins with Jonathan Harker's journey into Transylvania  (chapter 1).  ;Good website.  I'll post  the  answer  here  if  anyone  else is  unclear.  "" 22.

Your essay was certainly one of the best ones I read and far better than my own.;I hope reading examples of great peer reviews will help us write better ones. I don't agree with everything this person says, but they have good points and reading their review helped me look at my own work more clearly. It's clear they read my essay, and they care enough to give my specific grammar mistake. My next essay will have citations and a stronger conclusion.Peer #2-Form: The essay is clearly written with only one minor error in grammar,  spelling or usage (""The Queens ""frown,"" ""moan,"" and wring hands."" - does  this mean more than one Queen or were you intending something  different?). I wouldn't consider the entry in the Works cited was  required as you did not quote from the discussion either directly or  indirectly.Content: An interesting aspect to pick up on. I could have lived without the  chunks of composition theory about  limited-view or omniscient narrators  and the description of dramatic irony. They seemed like padding which  is hardly needed in a three hundred word essay. I'm almost tempted to  ask why there isn't a citation for your source on narrative devices.  A clear thesis was stated and some relevant examples shown. These could  have been stronger. There is really no conclusion and a very weak end to  the essay as it just seemed to rubn out of space or energy.

These are my contributions.Rebecca and Sean have posted in this thread.  Expand upon, don't describe. Examples must be clear, but peer reviewers have all read the work. If you spend a paragraph describing exactly what happened in the book, that doesn't add to our knowledge.  A sentence is not a paragraph.  The oft-abandoned rule is 3 sentences. It just reads and looks better.  No more than a couple quotes.  Too many and the quotes take over your own writing.And these are suggestions to game the system:Have a extremely clear one sentence thesis.  Reviewers have latched onto  this as  a requirement.Don't repeat vocabulary or use a lot of -ly adjectives.  Reviewers have latched onto this as bad writing.   No tangents, no matter how interesting what you have to say is.  Resist the urge and post in the forums instead. Everything must be centered around the thesis. Everything.  ;By ""oft-abandoned"" I did mean often abandoned for more important structural reasons, but I see how that intent isn't clear.;Sleep well. I'm sorry to have contributed to your frustration, but I care about this topic. If I'm mistaken or being arbitrary   then I definitely want to be corrected.  I find one sentence paragraphs awkward in an essay, especially when the sentence doesn't even span the line, and especially when there are multiple in a row. I received several such essays.  It's not as noticeable if it's a long sentence, but they read more like headings to me than part of the essay's body.  The three sentences minimum for a paragraph was taught to me in elementary school, but I feel keeping the paragraph divisions logical trumps an arbitrary rule.Do you really think an essay composed of many very short paragraphs is better than an essay with several larger paragraphs? The former's structure means it's nigh impossible to discuss each idea fully.;With food based off of the books we read.  And if no on wants to join me...

I watched/listened to an interesting discussion a while back between a bunch of authors about a newer genre of writing they termed 'urban fantasy' as being this generation's version of fairy tails. I'll include the link below, but the summation as I remember it is that as the settings of fairy tails have had less resonance (the forest, castles, etc) we have looked to other things to give us that sense of mystery (for city-dwellers -> the crowds of unknown strangers you pass every day). It was a fun talk and pretty relevant. It also is hosted by Patrick Rothfuss:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52khu_YJAmo;That's a great thought, Joanna! That lyrical nature of the writing is the first thing I thought about when I started reading Grimms' collection. The repetitious nature of the stories themselves... there isn't anything quite like it in modern literature. If anything they are more like pop songs.  The reason I hesitate to call things like Star Wars modern version of fair tales derives primarily from the trappings of the setting and the themes/tropes that are associated with modern writing. They may not be fairy tales themselves, but I'd argue they are definitely an evolution of that style of collective storytelling.  ;"

I'm not claiming that Shelly ever wrote the book with the intention of having Victor and the monster being one and the same. Point of this was just to point out that it is an interesting way to read the book and that the pieces exist to fit together such an interpretation.  Not sure if I have much to work with here, but did anyone else get the feeling that maybe there wasn't a monster in Frankenstein?  We only really have two eyewitnesses to the monster in the text, Frankenstein himself and the captain, two sources we have no reason to believe are completely trustworthy. Frankenstein, who relates nearly all of the story, may merely have had a guilty conscience that is not guilty enough to claim full credit for his misdeeds. Sailors have been known for flights of fancy (e.g. mermaids, sea serpents) and we know that Walton had aspirations towards writing - by his own admission he admired poets despite his apparent illiteracy. Did he maybe just run with the story or embellish it for his own ends?Let's talk about the monster itself now. The monster has an almost supernatural ability to learn, track Frankenstein and yet somehow beat him to his destination. Frankenstein himself has frequent explosive bouts of rage, illness, and despair and seems completely unwilling/unable to seek help or take precautions to save anyone from his creation. The two are opposite sides to the same coin: Frankenstein creates and his monster destroys, Frankenstein loves and the monster seeks to be loved, Frankenstein is associated with knowledge and the monster by his physical aspects, etc. Does he not want to stop the creation or is he aware, at some level, that he is one and the same?Anyone else have any comments on this idea? I plan to explore it a bit more for the submission this week and would love to have some counterarguments to help refine the idea.;I'm not necessarily arguing that Victor was the murderer in all cases, just that in his fractured mind he is making connections that may not be there. William's death may well not have been because of Victor, but this death had a profound effect on Victor's already fraying psyche. Victor imagines that his creation, the product of whatever breakdown he was having while at university, was responsible and starts connecting bits and pieces of the reality into his own version of the truth. Clerval's death is a little hazier since Victor was being a recluse during his creation of the monster's mate, but there is a parallel in Victor's dumping of the mate's body and the monster dumping Clerval's. Clerval may have been killed by Victor or might have just run afoul of someone else. As for being released from custody, don't forget that Victor comes from a well-to-do family. I would argue it is his father's arrival that ultimately gets him set free. There are little explanations for Elizabeth's death aside from Victor, he was the only other one we know of in the house. When he is found by the townsfolk he has blacked out.The point of this thread was just to point out an interesting alternative to the presumed reading of the novel. There is usually an agreement between author and reader that even in a fantasy setting they won't outright lie to you, but I just found it a fun thought experiment to look through the book and see 'what if the monster hadn't existed?';I do remember Walton being really desperate to find a friend he could connect with. Following this line of thought, maybe he was so desperate to be Frankenstein's friend that he was willing to indulge him in his lie. To that end, Walton lied about seeing the monster to give some closure to the whole account. Something like 'at the end of his life Frankenstein came to terms with what he had done and chose to go off on the ice in penance.'  ;Ehh... I don't think my essay turned out nearly as well as I had hoped due to the space limitations. All the discussion that has popped up on this page is far more interesting. Thanks for the interest though!  ;A true and good point, but it is also at this point that Victor is at his most unhinged. He is fleeing his life and civilization in pursuit of his creation, so if anything I feel his narrative is least trustworthy at this point.  But again, back to the point of Victor drawing connections where none exist, it could also be possible that the peasants saw *something* which Victor took as further proof he was chasing after his creation.;"

I'm a pathologist with specialty interests in neuropathology and ophthalmic pathology, in addition to having an interest in medical education and education in general.   I still continue to teach medical students and resident, tutoring small groups and giving lectures.   I've been reading SF and fantasy since childhood, but have little formal education in literary criticism, so the writing part of the course has been a stretch for me.   The 320-word limit is killing me, but discipline is good for the soul, I guess.I really like the format of the course delivery.   I've also enjoyed courses from the Teaching Company (now called the Great Courses) for years.   But Coursera courses provide an option for less passive learning, more interactive learning. So far, I've found that actually doing the assignments has increased what I've gotten out of this experience.   Apart from getting to read some good stories, I hope to learn to write better.  Based on the discussion forum, lot of energy is being expended commenting on peer evaluation and grading.   It's difficult to learn to give and receive feedback well but a lesson worth learning.   It's also a brilliant strategy, providing an educational experience for the learners and not having to grade papers yourself.I would be interested in knowing how much oversight the faculty provides, once all the lectures are in the can.   Professor Rabkin did provide some additional videos and comments after the first iteration of the course.   This is my first Coursera course, so I'm guessing we can provide course feedback at the end?;Great job!   I was criticized by a couple of reviewers for making references to works outside the assigned text in my first two essays (which got 5's), but when I wrote the 3rd I stuck only to the text and got 4.   So I'm not sure what ""the rules"" are for these essays. We can't check our previous education and experience at the door when we write them.   Your writing is a pleasure to read and I especially liked the outside references, especially the Rutherford quotation and the mathematical bits.    I agree with your observation that a connecting phrase between the math and universal themes paragraphs would have made this even better.   Keep up the good work.   ;I agree with Steinbeck (thanks, Kasey, for the quote).   Could it not be that some stories are so compelling that they are incorporated into our subconscious mind and that an author may not even be aware of the specific influences that are reborn in his or her story?   I am not a writer by trade or trained in literary analysis.   When I listen to Professor Rabkin's talks about the books we have read, I wonder whether the authors would recognize the ""hidden meanings""   he pulls out of their   stories.   Were the authors aware of these elements when they wrote them?   Or are they a part of our collective unconsciousness (with apologies to Jung.....) and they crept without conscious intent?;I have to admit I found reading this book pretty tiresome until the monster told his story.      Without revealing to much too those who haven't finished yet......I thought the monster made a compelling case for his loneliness and that his request for a companion was entirely reasonable.Should Dr. F have created a companion?Did Dr. F, as the monster's creator and, in some sense, parent, have a responsibility to provide for his well-being?Would the monster and his bride have ridden off into the sunset and lived happily ever after as the monster promised?Or was this all just an outpouring of Mary's teenage angst?;I, too, am really enjoying this course and am pleased to find so much depth of content in a free online course. I've been reading SF and children's literature for decades, but never had read the 19th century works (apart from Alice). (My current craze is YA dystopian novels.)   So this course has been a great excuse to read some of the classics I never got around to.     I've also appreciated Dr. Rabkin's video lectures.    I try read a little about the author for contextual background before writing my essay.   I usually get the big picture and the obvious symbolism in the assigned reading.    But I have realized that I will never be a scholar of literature.   I just like the stories.I'm decades removed from my formal education, so my essay writing skills are rusty. (I did a lot of technical writing in my career and writing to create educational materials.)   But I have embraced the discipline of writing the weekly essays, although the process is challenging, especially because the assignment is so open-ended.   Having to keep within the 320-word limit has forced me to do several drafts in order to be as concise as possible.   I don't really need certificate or course credit, so I look at the peer evaluations as useful feedback on whether I communicated effectively.   Useful feedback doesn't only come from people with advanced degrees.   I gather from the discussion forum that there are a lot of writers and aspiring writers in the course.   So getting feedback from the ""great unwashed"", i.e., their audience, is a gift.   And for those of you who aren't native speakers of English, kudos to you.   I wouldn't even attempt to write an essay in a language other than English.Doing the evaluations is in someways more difficult than writing the essay.   It's hard to give specific and meaningful feedback that might help the writer.   But this is also a brilliant move on the Professor's part.   It's a learning experience for the student and he doesn't have to grade the papers!   ;I watched the entire first session of The Following on TV and found the gratuitous violence really disturbing.   For those who haven't had the dubious pleasure of watching this show.....The cult leader is a Poe scholar who basically teaches his followers that killing frees them from social conventions (or at least I think that was the point). There are a lot of references to Poe's work and the killers sometimes wear Poe masks.Poe's work is also disturbing, dark, and depressing, although beautifully written.   I know that art should evoke some emotional response, but right now I'm having a hard time getting into it.   I hope that ^&*&%* show hasn't put me off Poe for life.    ;"

Woodfield, St Petersburg FL USA: a stinky old man trying to hog the glory LOL;Hi Catherine, I've read  The Master and Margarita twice and will read it again. Looking forward to checking out Murakami.;I saw something a little different in  Little Brother.   It is a coming of age story.   Its lessons may or may not have been learned by Marcus. The business of government is power and control and it will go to any lengths to perpetuate itself.   I was in my late teens and early 20s during most of the Viet Nam war.   The question on everyone's mind was: Why are we there? Anybody know?The answer that seems to ring true with me is in ""America Betrays Herself in Viet Nam"" in  The March of Folly by the great Barbara W. Tuchman.   Once America was sold the frame (I like that concept...it is clarifying)   ""being tough on communism,"" politicians had painted themselves into a corner. None were willing to extricate us from the absurdity of the Viet Nam war and creating the career-ending perception that they were ""soft on communism.""   The practical results of this ""do, say anything to stay in power"" attitude was that the kids from my neighborhood that I had played with at recess were getting shot and blown up in Asia for no good reason.Many of us didn't like it and the heart-breaking angst we felt when National Guardsmen shot and killed anti-war protesters at Kent State University was profound.The lesson I learned (and perhaps Marcus failed to learn because good fortune provided him with an influential investigative reporter) was: the government will lie to you, put you in jail or send you to your death if it serves its ends.   Free speech, freedom of assembly and the rights to privacy are myths for the uninitiated.   I agree with John that once action and the governmental reaction was framed as a ""war on terror"" Marcus had already lost the debate.   The moral of the story to me: unless you are wealthy and have good attorneys on retainer, try not to engage in open hostilities with the police state.   Keep a low profile...keep your head down and your mouth shut.   Say, ""yes sir"" and then once you are clear THEN engage in whatever subversive activities you must to fight the powers that be.  ;This course is just for fun...not a matter of life and death.   I'm enjoying it because I rarely read fantasy or science fiction, so I thought I would learn something a little different for me and achieve a new perspective perhaps.   I have read some of the books over the years and I'm not totally unfamiliar with the genre.   I read slowly for enjoyment and there is no way I can get through every written word recommended in this course, but I can be selective and spend time with what is of greatest interest to me. I have a ""self-interest"" rather than a ""must do this"" attitude.   I live by this motto: Do your Best and Forget the Rest.If I'm not taking a course for degree credit, I can complete the course or drop the course.   It really doesn't matter.

I don't think it is possible to have an emotional reaction if we don't have a psychic connection. The animals (and wicked step-mothers, witches and neglectful irresponsible fathers) in the stories portray human behavior in such an objective and instructing manner so that I can look at myself once removed and think, ""Man, I sure don't want to be like that."" The stories present negative examples as I suspend disbelief and identify with whichever characters manage to vibrate a corresponding cord within me.   Some of Grimms' stories are Greek tragedies in miniature.   They can be cathartic in the same sense.   When I read about Oedipus blinding himself after killing his father and marrying his mother, I think maybe my life isn't as complicated and difficult as I sometimes make it out to be in my head.   I watch disasters on the TV news and think: this is horrible, I want to see it; I'm glad it ain't me.   Tragedy prepares one emotionally for the the painful things that befall all of us as we make our way through life.

The  collecting of m _rchen    from storytellers seems to fit well as a mechanism for the philiological research. The oral tradition of storytelling is a universal constant, as are fairytales, as discussed by Professor Rabkin.  The story tellers will put on different voices for characters, and act out scenes in their stories. They are not only sharing the story, or the moral of the story, they are sharing deep held hopes and fears, beliefs and part of their local cultre. Analysing the sounds of the language you ascertain regional changes. I am a Scot who lives in Switzerland with my German husband. His dialect, Schw _bisch, from W _rtemburg, is very different than that of my work colleagues from Baden. Yet Baden W _rtemburg  is classed as one ""state"" of Germany. Even in relatively small distances the  changes in the spoken language are noticeable. Switzerland   has 4 official languages, but the majority of the population are Swiss German speakers. The  problem is that the Swiss German dialects change rapidly as you travel aroud the country and there is no official written Swiss language. The vowel sounds change from canton to canton, different words are used for the same object, and for German colleagues, it can be almost impenetrable. I can clearly see why this part of the world would be interesting to a Philologist. ;I believe that the wife of one of the brothers also contributed to stories that they put in print.

On the one hand, the Grimm brothers might have been trying to accurately represent the stories that existed in the oral tradition. Notice that there are many similarities between stories. For example, in both ""The Wolf and the Seven Goslings"" (40) and ""Little Red Cap"" (132), the wolf eats a main character whole, and someone else comes along, cuts the wolf up, rescues the person swallowed whole, and fills the wolf with stones. Other stories seemed to be repeats, too, with just a few elements changed. Thus it seems the Grimm brothers were trying to be academic about their project, rather than artistic or entertaining--trying to accurately represent, to preserve, the oral tradition that existed in these areas.On the other hand, in writing the stories down, the Grimm brothers created The Definitive Text. After they wrote the stories down, the stories were not purely oral anymore. It's the difference between your mom reading you a story, on one hand, and telling you the story about your great grandparents meeting and getting married. In the oral tradition, certain details can be emphasized or changed to reflect a need at that particular time. Notice the stories that emphasize the industriousness of the characters--industriousness as a virtue equal to kindness, patience and faithfulness. This rise of industriousness is absolutely consistent with the times during which the stories were written down: During the 19th century, as industry was growing more prominent, wealth and success--rank in society--could be earned rather than exclusively inherited. What we don't have--what we can only imagine or guess at--is what these stories would have been like, say, a hundred or two hundred years before they were written down. There certainly wasn't one story told the same way all the time in all the houses in all the areas in all the land, but I would guess that ghosts of an earlier time still linger in the stories we have today. Some of them seem similar to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. For example, the archetype of the miller exists in both. I think it's important to read these stories with an eye on their oral histories, but also with recognition of the fact that what we have access to is not the oral tradition itself, but a snapshot taken at a very specific time. ;The story of Faithful John reminds me of a story from the Christian Bible, of Abraham and his son Isaac. At some point, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son. Obedience would show that Abraham held God and God's commands over Abraham's own desires. From what I remember of the story, Abraham followed God's command, but at the last moment, God interrupted the sacrifice. It was, after all, only a test of Abraham's loyalty and obedience. As Abraham passed the test, so God spared Isaac before the sacrifice was even committed.;This story reminds me of Erasmus's Praise of Folly, where Dame Folly--Folly herself!--describes the virtues of foolishness. Reading it, you wonder at Erasmus's opinion: is Folly wholly bad, or is she/it really, really to be praised? Is there really some virtue to being foolish? Erasmus, a humanist, was possibly aiming to complicate readers' assumptions and preconceptions. ""Hans in Luck,"" originating in an oral tradition, might simply be an amusing tale. Everyone has known a foolish person who's made a very unwise investment, and so everyone hearing the tale (or reading it, for that matter) can laugh about it. And I believe each and every one of us is similarly guilty of making unwise investments, and many of us continue to be foolishly happy or satisfied about them.But this story does make one think, doesn't it? About whether or not Hans really is lucky?;"

It may not matter much when talking about the story as a whole--Rapunzel still lets down her hair no matter what version of the story you read--but when getting down to the details and specific wording, I for one am much more comfortable making it clear which publication I'm using. I don't know what is or is not in other publications; what I write is accurate for the publication I've read.;The Modern Language Association, creator of the MLA citation style, is doing its best to keep up with the growing numbers of ways readers can encounter texts. I don't know if they have specific rules for Kindles, Nooks, and iPads as of yet, but the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL) points out that you can use the rules that already exist and apply them to eReaders. Thus, a citation for the Works Cited page for an eBook looks like a normal citation, but at the end you simply indicate the electronic format:Author Lastname, Author Firstname. Title of Book. Place of Publication:  Publisher, Year of Publication. Type of file.The year of publication, by the way, refers to the year the book was published in an electronic format. Thus, the citation for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland looks like this:  Carroll, Lewis. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2013. Kindle AZW file.   See these links for more information: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/18/ http://www.mla.org/style/handbook_faq/cite_an_ebook;You raise a good point about the variety of students in the class, Patricia. It probably is enough, at least for the purposes of this course, to simply name the author and title of the work discussed. Still, other information  that is included in conventional citations can be  helpful, such as which version, edition, or publication is being discussed. For example, there are numerous publications of Grimm's fairy tales, and I'm sure we didn't all stick to the same recommended version. The differences between the publications may be minor--Rapunzel lets down her hair in every version of the tale, I would bet--and maybe not. Then again, who's to say what's minor and what's not, anyway? In any case, I don't think it hurts to have access to information  about citation styles, and people can use it or not as they see fit.;I agree with you about the misleading date. However, the citation is supposed to reflect the text you used, which may be different from the original. You can include the year of original publication after the title of the book, like so: Carroll, Lewis. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland. 1865. Adelaide, South Australia: eBooks@Adelaide, 2013. Kindle AZW file.But you should also have publication information for the specific text you read.And there are differences between different versions. Curiously, my Kindle version of Carroll's books seems to have occasionally left off punctuation that I doubt Carroll himself, a Victorian, would have left off. Additionally, some words were missing letters. If I were to directly quote a passage with a mistake, I would have had to do so using  square brackets,  like this (And this is just an example; when looking again, I couldn't relocate any of the instances where this happened): ""The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious thing[s]"" (Wonderland, Ch 5).I'm sure I go waaaaay overboard with this :-) I'm glad you are including a citation for the text we are reading.;"

Why change anything if it didn't matter? Then again, sometimes changes are so subtle that it would take several weeks of intensive study to recognize the impact. That's probably the case with Frankenstein and this course. Since we're writing short essays and not, for instance, papers for a journal, either edition probably will suffice.And now for too much information:Anne K. Mellor, in an article called ""Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach"" (originally published in Approaches to Teaching Shelley's Frankenstein, 1990, but also included in the Norton Critical Edition of Frankenstein, 1996), says that there are significant differences between the 1818 and 1831 versions. She writes, [W]e must recognize that between 1818 and 1831, Mary Shelley's philosophical views changed radically, primarily as a result of the pessimism generated by the deaths of Clara, William, and Percy Shelley; by the betrayals of Byron and Jane Williams; and by her severely straitened economic circumstances. These events convinced Mary Shelley that human events are decided not by personal choice or free will but by an indifferent destiny or fate. The values implicitly espoused in the first edition of Frankenstein--that nature is a nurturing and benevolent life force that punishes only those who transgress against its sacred rights, that Victor is morally responsible for his acts, that the Creature is potentially good but driven to evil by social and parental neglect, that a family like the De Laceys that loves all its children equally offers the best hope for human happiness, and that human egotism causes the greatest suffering in the world--are all rejected in the 1831 revisions. (164-5)  In literature, everything is debatable. Whether Mellor's reading of the revisions is accurate, or whether she is reading more into the revisions than is  actually there, I really couldn't say. I think you're correct, though, Dioni, that the free Kindle edition is the 1818 one. Amazon seems to think so, at any rate. (It's sad that a bookseller seems oblivious to important details such as this one.);Maria, I've heard a suggestion in another Coursera course that the quality of peer responses could be improved by allowing the reviewee to respond back to the reviewer. In other words, if I reviewed your paper and didn't explain myself very well, you could respond to me, asking for clarification or just telling me how helpful my feedback was (or wasn't). Knowing that someone will write back to me will cause me to be more thoughtful about my comments. Since this course does not have that feature, reviewing the reviewer in an open forum like this makes sense as an alternative. It's not direct feedback to the reviewer (which would be ideal), but it is an opportunity to redress a wrong, to vent, and/or to try to teach people how to give constructive feedback. ;"

There's the entire third time lucky thing which we see a lot here - the third time there's a different result (to pull an example, in the first story, the third time the rabbit asks the maiden jumps on his tail). There's also the idea that accidents always happen in threes - apparently an idea connected to Peter denying Christ three times. ;I presumed that since she'd tried to shoo him twice before and he'd come back she thought the only way her family would be rid of him for good was if she went with him. ;I have to agree that I really don't read ignorance in it.

And when the animals follow on he's not ignorant, or at least the moral isn't that ignorance kills or it would be he who died and not them as if they do harbor some malignant intent then he's ignorant of they're punished for it, not him. I'm also not sure what point you think the cock's missing at the end. I think it's a bit of a tricky one. Unless the moral is meant to be don't be greedy or EVERYONE DIES which...actually that could work but then the story should be from the hen's perspective. ;I agree very much. To an extent I can accept that picking up these books is going to expose me to a level of sexist and racist language that is going to make me uncomfortable and by acknowledging that before I start I can at least accept it. Sometimes things strike me out of the left field though. I've made one attempt at reading a Bond novel and I was expecting the sexism and the racism but I got blindsided by the homophobia. I presume part of the reason for choosing so many older texts is to make the course more accessible for those of us on smaller budgets but, yeah, some of these readings are going to be quite difficult. ;Repetition is a powerful tool for learning. Remember that these stories were intended to impart lessons to their audiences, they weren't just for entertainment, so being easily remembered was a bonus. I think an element of it is that these were oral tales. If you're narrating a story - especially to children, you don't say ""he did it three times..."" You say ""he did it, and it didn't work! Then he tried again, and it still didn't work. And then he tried AGAIN and THIS TIME...""   It builds anticipation into the story, particularly as we expect that different outcome the third time so it builds to it. If he achieved the first time it wouldn't be as meaningful (an achievement is always worth more if you fail first). I think that's much less effective in writing then read out loud. It also makes a part of the story familiar which promotes engagement with it. These stories were moral tales - intended to teach lessons. It was important that they were engaging and memorable. Repetition is a strong memory tool and by repeating the audience learns as they go so they can join in with reciting the story which gives them a sense of personal investment in it. ;Who says your wrong? Your ideas were the best ideas you had in light of the information you had at the time. I hate this idea that you're 'wrong' if you don't immediately jump to the solution that scholars who've dedicated large portions of their life to studying something have reached.   Also, presuming somehow you have made some horrible blunder and claimed the sky is green and you are obviously and irreconcilably wrong. Why is that a bad thing? To start with, this is a safe space to be wrong. I don't know you. You don't know me. What does it matter to you what I think of you? It doesn't. You'll never meet me so this is the ultimate safe space as no judgement any of us make on you here will ever have any impact in the real world. Second, sometimes being 'wrong' is good. Nobody's expecting you to hand in a work of scholarly brilliance for your first essay. They're not expecting it for your last essay - what they're expecting though is that you'll grow. Part of growing is getting stuff wrong. What did you get wrong and why? Did you not think closely enough about the cultural background? Because that's a lesson for next time. Did you infer something about the authors that was wrong? Because that's a lesson for next time. Did you not consider an element of the text? Because that is a lesson though the lesson there may be that you can't consider everything. In much the way Grimm's tales were influenced by their culture, our essays and readings are going to be influenced by our cultures and ideas. I think what might also help you is refocusing a little. Ultimately this class isn't about learning about twelve books. That's an exciting element of it but what it's trying to do it make you in to a more thoughtful reader which is a skill you can take with you. When you're picking up a novel from your shelf someone won't stop by and lecture you on it before you begin - but you don't need that crutch to draw meaningful analysis from a story and that's the skill this course is trying to give you - an ability to draw meaningful analysis without having to be told what the outcome of that analysis is first. And maybe your meaning will never be the one the scholars give but if you get more meaning and pleasure from reading isn't that an end in itself? ;Well said, Daniel. It seems to me that a bad pedagogy is one that's based on regurgitating remembered 'facts' instead of critical thinking and developing cognitive skills which allow you to generate your own meaningful ideas. Which is also exactly what I think is wrong with the education system as a whole and the changes Michael Gove is making in the UK specifically but don't even get me started, you won't like me when I talk politics and education. I think the part of your argument I disagree with, Jerard, is that you're thinking the 'meat' of the course will be the taught material and the reading is meant to supplement that. I'm looking at it the other way round. To me the 'meat', the point, is the time I spend reading the books. It's how I can already feel myself developing as a more thoughtful and attentive reader and the lectures are there for me as a supplementary resource but they'd bias my reading if I had them before I read as I'd be looking for what the lecturer had told me about, not finding meaning for myself in the text. I think, ultimately, the thing is that with a literature course there aren't necessarily right answers and that's kind of upsetting. I get that, in my other-life I'm a science teacher but this isn't like science - there aren't absolutes and the only wrong answer is the one you can't support. Your answer isn't wrong because it doesn't match the interpretation the course has given you, just different, and ultimately if those videos had been released at the start we'd have a plethora of essays about those videos and those interpretations, not about the source text. ;That's really interesting. I like the idea of the unpredictability of Wonderland being the unpredictability of the adult world to a child. It also makes sense of Alice's uses of lessons. In Wonderland though less in looking glass she constantly attempt to understand and control her surroundings by applying the 'lessons' she has been taught in school - the things that are meant to enable her to function in the adult world - and she's constantly thwarted. That makes a lot of sense as we do teach kids a lot of things in school we insist they're going to need in the real world and ultimately most of them won't help them control or interpret their world (not that those things are meaningless but that they don't have this practical application we insist on). ;I'm not sure what you mean by symbolism of the name. Can you expand on that a little. I thought you meant what the name symbolises as in the image it creates for the reader but you're talking about the scene where Alice loses her name so do you more mean the symbolism of names as in what does the possession of a name symbolise? Names generally symbolise identify - to strip someone of their name is to remove their identity as an individual (think prisoner or soldiers being addressed be a number or rank or whatever - the intent is to remove their identity, their individuality, and make them something else). I think Alice losing her name is mostly to do with her losing her sense of self - something that's a recurring theme across both books. Sorry if I'm entirely off target there. ;I'm going to disagree, actually. I think that if the videos were released earlier people would watch them earlier and it would bias their reading. I very much like the aspect of the course where we're forced to present our own interpretation before we're allowed access to opinions that are likely to bias our own. It means we actually have to read and think and process. The course is very time intensive but I would point out that once the videos are released they are there for the rest of the course. If those 48 hours are your busiest then just mark during that time (the marking doesn't take long) and then watch the videos the day after before starting the next reading. I don't think it's possible to entirely avoid overlapping the readings on this course due to the length of some of them (I don't think it's possible to read Dracula in 4 days) so that's just an aspect you'll have to deal with. The only argument I can see is for early release of the 'start of reading' videos for each book but they might recap ideas from earlier lectures so if that's the case I can see the argument for not doing it too. ;"

When you compare Mina to Lucy and how they're portrayed you see that Lucy is seen as the ideal. She is so lovely, so innocent and so pure that not only do three wealthy and powerful men, one with a title, propose to her on the same day (and what more could a woman want then a husband - women exist only to be desired and protected by men) but Dracula, on first landing, is immediately drawn to her as she is all that's good about English women. Mina, on the other hand, is still lovely but she's working class where Lucy was upper class. We're told at the start that she's a deputy school mistress and we know she had no parents. We know Jonathan was also like this but when they pass in to money while he continues his work she immediately stops to tend house. Though she is surprisingly practical and useful given the representation of Lucy she is still ultimately seen as something to be protected by men and also as something less desirable then Lucy (she is their consolation prize - they couldn't save Lucy so they will save her. Dracula only takes an interest in her to upset the men - she's a tool for him). Also, Stoker uses Mina as a mouthpiece in the scene where she's watching Lucy sleep to explicitly criticise New Women and their ideas - drawn out more in how she says these women will soon want men to see a woman sleep before she even proposes (see her sleep, right) and then it's Dracula encountering Lucy in her sleep (before he even proposes, the cad) that leads to her ultimate death. ;Societal norms often aren't as strict as people would like to believe. In the past, if there was a thing, women did it. Often not in the quantities that men did it but they did it. They dressed as men to go to war, the wrote novels, conducted scientific experiments, made music. We like to believe that women working is a new enlightened thing but, of course, women have always worked. What's new is upper class women who don't have to working (see again Mina who works until they come into money then stops). And, ultimately, people are always people. There will always be just as many suborn, righteous, strong and brave women as there are men, we've just constructed a cultural narrative where these people don't exist and so we erase them. It's one of the reasons stories are so powerful. They tell us about the world and we accept truth from them - even if we know the work is fiction - and they shape how we interact with the rest of the world. Women played strong roles throughout history so it's not out of place for them to do so in historical fiction - it's just outside the narrative we've built for ourselves about what women were like 'back then'. Stoker was making a statement with his book about how he thought men and women should be. He was very clear about it - we're constantly told of the strength and bravery of men and how they're to protect women and how sweet and childlike women are (at one point I underlined every time the word sweet was used to describe a woman then I gave up in despair). Of course that message is a reflection of the society he lived in and the messages other people were creating about women at that time but it doesn't mean it wasn't a very deliberate message. It is in fact very easy to read a narrative on the dangers of female sexuality in this book. ;I think it's also worth noting that they don't bring Mina because they recognise her inherent value but so they can better protect her. She's not there to be an active participant in the demise of the person who's wronged her, it's made abundantly clear that it's her husband's right to kill Dracula for messing with his stuff. Ultimately, they act as though it's not Mina herself who's been wronged but rather the men who consider her theirs and who she is being taken from. ;Anthony makes some good points about the story being logical but I want to pick up on you asking if wonderland has laws. I think there are still certain natural laws that hold true within wonderland (eating changes Alice's size, for example). It's not truly a world consisting of only chaos. She doesn't eat some things and they turn her in to an octopus and another time is makes her invisible and another time is transports her to Canada and another time is causes a butterfly to die - there's always the predictable effect on size. ;I find it really frustrating that I can't argue back XD I'm clearly too argumentative. I disagree with some of my evaluation though agree with other points of it. At the end of the day it's my own evaluation of my work and how I'm progressing that's important, though, so I need to focus on that so I don't get too frustrated. ;Yep, I'm hoping that too. I think I'm going to tell people how many point I'm giving them and why in future reviews as I know I'd like to know that from my reviewers. ;Nice idea in theory but I can see it leaving to long drawn out arguments among people with no redeeming value. I think the best thing about this system is that you can't do that, you kind of just have to accept it and it's as annoying as all hell because I'd very much like to e-mail someone now and tell them they missed the point of my essay but if I could I'd get tied up in arguing that one point with one person and I'd get increasingly angry and frustrated with it all. This way I can say ""I think they're wrong"" to myself and that's the end of it. It WOULD be nice if we knew how many points exactly different people had given us (did peer x criticise but still mark highly indicating their criticism wasn't a strong one, for example. Or if that person who left you really intelligent feedback so who's opinion you respect marked you highly that might make up in your head for the fact that the person who missed the point gave you nothing).;You could but, maybe I just distrust people on forums but I can see people who were unhappy with a mark harassing the person who gave them that mark. I can see value in it but I think it would create a lot more points of conflict then of genuine exchange and if someone has raised an issue you want to discuss then you can always start a new thread for it on the forum. ;I like that a lot. I didn't think to do it as I presumed it'd tell you the mark they gave you. ;I will completely back going to see this. I didn't get to see it live but I've seen the recording twice - with Cumberbatch as the monster and with Miller as the monster - and it is an amazing play. The reason I actually picked this course above any others is it listed Frankenstein as a reading and I've wanted to make time for it since I saw this. It is an incredibly powerful piece of theater. ;It really amuses me how it's not just our culture it's permeated either. I'm a fan of a Japanese animation called Hellsing which is about the heir of the Hellsing family who fight evil in England using a vampire captured by her family called Alucard (take that and reverse it). It actually features some amazing kickass women but it's kind of weird to see something we think of as so dominant in western culture interpreted in to what the Japanese think our culture is like. ;I do prefer 1st person - I think it's more emotionally engaging. For the criticism that you don't know if they're going to die or not a friend of mine wrote a blog entry about that recently that says what I want to only better. http://itsthefuturestupid.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/why-george-r-r-martin-is-wrong-about.html;That's really interesting. I wondered while I was reading which things Stoker invented himself and which he used from existing folklore. ;I'd agree with that entirely. I read it and other things as a kind of condemnation of our modern world view (and secularism, particularly) as throughout there's a lot of emphasis on trust and faith and believing each other other evidence and the fact that failure to engage with local traditions and superstitions consistently places people in danger - is Jonathan had attended to the beliefs of the locals instead of dismissing them from the beginning the entire thing might have been avoided and while religion and God is present throughout the book in the later stages they come more and more to rely on it and to note how they're placing themselves in the hands of god - moving away from their modern ideas and reason to something closer to the religion the natives display at the beginning that Harker thinks himself so above. ;Though it's through book learning that he comes across the traditions they are still traditional and folk stories he's drawing from. He might learn them in a book but it's not science that defeats Dracula. Though, actually, he knowledge of psychology is used so I suppose I should modify my argument to say that it isn't complete rejection of science but an argument to not reject an idea because it isn't scientific? That if people of learning can keep traditional and religion also and not be ruled by science alone and unable to have faith they'll be stronger for it? ;Not really. i had a hard time pulling it all together at the end and felt my concluding remark was a bit vague. We'll see. ;I should hope not, that seems incredibly harsh. ;"

He is a child, only a few years for this world and of the many things that Frankenstein failed to teach him, personal responsibility was one. While personal responsibility is great and he does lack it I think it's important to remember that while we do all have ultimate responsibility for our own actions - things outside of ourselves can force our hand in a given direction which is what happened here. The monster doesn't take responsibility for what he did but at the same time WOULD he have killed if, instead of running, Frankenstein had taken responsibility for the life he brought forth in to this world? If he had been granted just that small amount of human comfort instead of shunned for his appearance?;Francine, I found the book very hard at first as I strongly dislike Frankenstein but I found the section where the monster narrates his take to Frankenstein to be a lot more engaging (problems with the lack of a high level of finesse in the story-telling persist but at least I didn't actively dislike the protagonist) so stick with it? ;Though Van Helsing may well be a trained medical doctor he is not a practicing doctor at the time at the novel, which is what the question asked.

Even then, this is a literature class with a high level of English stated as a requirement, there is going to be a high expectation of the spoken English.

If you asked around the forums I'm sure you'd find people to help. Though I do agree with you that, yes, marking on the second part for grammar is a bit of a problem. Especially as you seem quite clear, though I mist admit that I've marked essays where the English is at a level where I couldn't understand what they meant at all so I felt I had to mark the second section as a 1 as I couldn't assess the validity of their argument as their argument was unintelligible. ;It's a complicated question actually. I think the monster's request (for someone to love him) was reasonable but also a lot of Frankenstein's reasons for not following through (the fact that the female monster may well reject the existing monster and make the situation worse) was also valid. Maybe instead of creating another monster, Frankenstein should have taken the monster he had already made in and shown some responsibility for the life he created. ;Yep. Afraid with this course it's kind of just luck of the draw as to how you're graded so I wouldn't panic. I don't mind peer marking so much but I do kind of wish we graded the same peers every week and were graded by so there was some kind of consistence to the grading and we could actually help each other build on previous work and provide new helpful comments. It could still be anonymous, just the same anonymous voices every week would be nice. Though then I suppose if you're stuck with 5 critics you're in trouble. ;That's kind of depressing. I can see the point and the reason - I just feel like every week I'm starting from scratch both as a writer and as a reviewer. I'll feel a lot better when I've achieved the minimum required to pass and I know all this effort won't be rendered void by someone who's feeling a little mean when marking. ;Both have a vested interest in the case they present. The 'truth' such as their is truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. Like any person born the monster was probably born with the potential to violence and then driven there by the things that happened to him. But ultimately all the narrators in this story are unreliable so anyone guess is as good as anyone elses. ;...any book used in the construction of the essay should be mentioned there - whether quoted or not. So if I use an idea I found when reading around in my essay I need to quote the source for that idea even if I don't directly quote it. ;Further clarify - If you use page numbers in your citations ie (Shelly 142) you NEED to say which edition of the book you're using as what's on page 142 in your book might not be on page 142 in my book. So in that case where you provide page numbers you DO need to cite the unit book. ;Surely if you want to explore something new you could mind-map ideas after reading the text and select one for yourself that you feel will challenge your limits? ;Science is more than just a process. To say science is a process and ethics are only tangentially involved is the same as saying art is a process and ideas are only tengentally involved as it's humans making the art. This is basically true, there is a certain process to doing an experiment or painting a picture but it's the meaning that the scientists and artists give to that work, ethical and morally as well as practically, that really define science and art.

Considering marking down as I have previously marked down for people who spent their essay comparing it to other outside sources - the exception being things like mythology or the bible. ;Expecting them as they're essentially part of our cultural mythology. It's a fairly valid assumption that most people will have at least a passing grasp of, for example, the story of creation in genesis (though I would also expect the essay to not presume detailed knowledge of the story). It's culturally assumed knowledge and I know that assumption isn't valid for all cultures but this is a course hosted by an American university and the lecturer treats them as assumed knowledge so I think that's valid. On the other hand, if I went up to a stranger in the street and asked them if they've read ""The time machine"" to grab an example, most of them would say no. It's not assumed cultural knowledge, most people do not know the plot of the time machine and most people would not expect you to know the plot of the time machine. I should further stipulate that of course it's valid to compare your book to an outside source but I think it's essentially impossible to do it in a meaningful way in an essay of this length with a text that is not assumed knowledge. ;"

If it is to show that a work influenced the one that's being read then this is especially valid. We can presume that all the authors we've encountered so far would be versed in christian mythology. It's clear, for example, that the story of the fall was an influence in Rappaccini's Daughter. The other thing we can do and what I've seen a lot more often is draw parallels between two writers but not claiming that one was a direct influence on the other and I believe that not only is this a lot harder to do well but it's a lot harder to do in the word limit imposed by the course. I've seen a few 'these stories share these themes' but, really, how does knowing that enrich your reading? You need to talk it a step further and explore what that implies, if anything. Is is just a common writing technique they both used - was there a shared inspiration of life event or educational quirk that caused that - does it tell us something about society and the pervading cultural ideas or about literature or about the human condition? Just pointing out that two stories hold similarities isn't actually deeply enlightening, especially if one isn't even an assigned text. ;Genesis 2.17 - But  of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of  it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.King James VersionGod never commanded that Adam and Eve should not eat of the tree of life.

It was an essay that was a true pleasure to read and really broadened my thinking about a story. I think the form in particular has improved significantly, there are far fewer essays with obvious errors coming through now. I presume this is due to people with a low knowledge of English struggling with and subsequently leaving the course which is actually quite depressing when you think about it. Content has also improved but I haven't seen the marked increase in content I did in form. ;Yeah, that's a fun comment. I've learnt to just take my peer reviews in my stride.

Grammar checkers on the internet aren't humans so don't always trust them.   Just like another forum poster stated, this is the first time for evaluators too.

Either way, there are plenty of Fantasy/Sci-fi that is written today that would offend you.   But these are just stories.   I actually found the punishment of rolling someone in a barrel stuck full of nails humorous which shows how different people are.

In an internet course such as this, it's even more important to make a good impression with the essay.   I don't know anyone here.   I've never seen anyone here at the campus library or in the classroom.   So unfortunately, the impression I get may be wrong, but I have nothing else to go by except what is in front of me.I think one need not have such a soft skin when it comes to these evaluations.   Anyway, there are multiple evaluations so if you get discouraged by one bad one out of four, let it go.   If you see all your evaluations as negative, then this should signal that you need to work harder.;The soft skin comment wasn't directed at you which was why I used 'one' and not 'you'.   Either way, it wasn't abuse at all.   I guess what I was trying to say was that if one were to let every negative evaluation get to them, it would just be a waste of energy.    This type of criticism should be expected from a free internet course where people can basically remain anonymous and who may not care as much about feelings as someone evaluating your essay face-to-face.;I agree with Joshua, that visual formatting is important.   For me, it is just as important as the content itself.   When evaluating essays in unit 1, there were some that had one long paragraph.   I immediately became disinterested.    This is fine if you are brainstorming or taking notes for yourself, but if this is going to be presented to the ""intelligent and attentive"" reader, I'd expect more effort to be put forth.   ;I'll clarify for the anonymous poster who cowardly can't use their real name.    For me, visual formatting is just as important than content in this course where we have to evaluate multiple essays with a limited amount of time.  ;I like to complement my completion of a book sometimes by watching the movie.   I picked the 1992 movie of Dracula because frankly I can't get into the black and white. I only made it through about 45 minutes.   I found the movie similar to the book in many ways but I started to become bothered by the imagery (when Lucy is led to Dracula) when it widely conflicted with my own from the reading.   Does anyone else feel like a movie ever really complements the reading of the book?   Can you gain any more insight into a story or does it actually have a negative effect on your thought process?;Great movies to bring up because I agree with you on both.

Researching the meaning of the color red, in particular, provided many insights into the reading of the tales. Through studies, red has been found to be the color first perceived by infants, and even the first color recognized in patients who have suffered traumatic brain injuries that affect their visual perception. To Neolitiic peoples red was likely considered the most important color. This can be seen by their placement of red ochre in graves, and the use of the pigment in cave paintings, used to depict animals to conjure fertility and good hunting. The word 'magic' translates to 'tarfur' in Old Norse, and is related to the Anglo-Saxon word 'teafor' which means 'red ochre.'A common belief in the pre-Medieval and Medieval eras in Europe saw the color red offering protective powers against evil influence. Objects, animals and trees were covered with red pigment, and warriors painted axes, spears and catapults covered in red paint to endow the weapons with magic power. Some Australian aboriginies still follow this practice today.  Both Neolithic hunters and Germanic warriors used to paint their weapons and bodies with the blood of slain animals, and Roman gladiators drank the blood of dying adversaries to take their strength. In some cultures babies were even bathed in blood of strong, good-looking animals, so as to absorb their strength.  Red painted amulets or gems were used as charms against the 'evil eye,' and wearing a ruby was thought to bring about invincibility against bad omens or ill health. Bed-clothing was customarily red in Germany up to the middle ages, and used as a protection against 'red illnesses,' such as fevers, rashes and miscarriages. Garlands and scarves of the color were part of wedding customs in many areas, and indeed red veils are still worn by brides in some south-eastern European countries.  The brides were wrapped in a fiery red veil, likely used to symbolize love and fertility.  In Germany red wedding gowns were fashionable into the 18th century, but was a custom dating back to the Roman era. To this day, red is still the gown choice of color for Chinese brides, who are carried in a red litter, and walk on a red carpet. Neighbors even bring red eggs when a couple welcomes a child.  A red rose is seen as a symbol of love and fidelity. In Greek legend the red rose sprung from the blood of Adonis, and it symbolizes the cycle of growth and decay, but also love and affinity, and was dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite. In christianity it symbolizes the cross and Christ's bloodshed, and the Israelites' painted their door frames with blood to scare demons away.  Even the phoenix, or firebird, was associated with cleansing and renewal, and promised good fortune and longevity. Fire, and by affinity the color red itself, was seen as giving life itself, providing both warmth and protection.In the texts we see the use of the color red as allegory for protection, or stages of trials to achieve a desired goal.  For Clever Grethel the wearing of her red heels make her feel special, and others in the village see her as feeling self-important, due to the color of the shoes. In the Death of the Hen, the bride wanted red silk in trade; and in The Three Little Men In The Woods, the finding of the red strawberries is her reward for her kindness and help.  In both The Goose Girl and Little Red Cap, we see the use of red objects as protection. The Queen offers a cloth with three drops of her blood to her daughter, and the red cap was a offering of love and protection by her mother.We see the use of red in trials in both The Raven and Faithful John. In The Raven, one of the sets of horses used to ferry her were red, and in Faithful John a red horse comes from the heavens as the first of three trials he confronts for the King. In the Six Soldiers of Fortune, the iron of the floor was turned red-hot in an attempt to kill them, but is ultimately the second of three trials they overcome to win their fortune. The red flag used in The Twelve Brothers can be seen as protection by their mother, as this is their warning signal to escape their deaths.  In Roland, the protagonist changes herself into a red milestone, a marker with which her love could find her again. Also in Snow White, we see the Queen receive her with for a child with the spilling of the thee red drops of her blood. Also the eating of the red poisoned apple, ultimately leads her to her love. Finally, the iron shoes being heated red-hot and placed on the Queen, sees the end of the threat to her life.Any thoughts on this reading of the texts?;I think that is a very relevant and interesting way of looking at the text. Especially considering the books can be read almost as a 'coming of age tale' for Alice's character. The many correlations that can be drawn between her growing up and losing her childlike innocence, and what occurs to her throughout the book are quite clear. Her discomfort and frustration at never being the right size, and losing control of parts of her body, such as her neck, are upsetting to her. Her effort the enter the 'idyllic garden' can represent her desire to hold on to her childhood and innocence also. The train can represent the movement ever closer to adulthood, and away from her childhood. Also, the White Knight character who comes to her aid is later forced to abandon her when she is ready to move into becoming a 'queen,' which can also be seen as a metaphor for growing up.   I have found that as I age I look more and more into the meanings of texts, in particular from a woman's perspective.  ;"

The story starts at or around St. George's day, and St. George's flag is iconically red & white. Black, too, features, in Dracula's heart, in the night he operates under, and so on. An interesting topic, and some great comments - thanks for sharing!;He may be a cad, but he is at least sensitive enough to feel guilt for it; your true cad barely notices. Anyway, a half formed thought about shame:I argue below that the creation of the monster is, essentially, a masturbatory act. This, in some ways, is shameful enough, but it does not entirely explain Victor's reaction to the monster. I think it's worth considering the context of the book, and in particular the rather tangled biographical details that surround its writing. I think there are parallels to be drawn between Victor, the scientist creator, and Percy Bysse Shelley, the creative poet. Not in that Shelley writes ugly poetry, but in considering the circumstances of his elopement with Mary - not, in fact, his wife in 1816, but ""the other woman"".Shelley at that time was still married to Harriet Westbrook, with whom he had had a child in 1813. He had abandoned both to pursue other women, including the various Godwin sisters. I personally feel that Frankenstein's guilt and shame reflect, in part, something of Percy Shelley's guilt and shame at that act, and that Victor's deep misery is both sexual and parental - coded shame for a regretted sexual entanglement (one the limited biographical details on Wiki suggest Percy came to feel was 'beneath him') and guilt at parental abandonment. Elizabeth herself suspects Victor of having an affair, and the monster, dreadful evidence of a prior 'wanton' liason, exacts his revenge on their wedding night - and few things are likely to spoil a bride's wedding night like the discovery of the bridegroom's bastard child.;For what it's worth, one of Percy's pen-names was Victor, and according to Wiki he spent time at university experimenting with the sciences.;I think it goes a bit deeper than teasing...! He separated from his first wife, who died shortly after the publication of Frankenstein. Looked at from the perspective of a man who recently left his child, much like Victor fleeing the monster, the books becomes even darker than it already seems. ;The gender roles is certainly a good observation. Victor is certainly trying to be god, but doing so in the only way he knows how - by mimicking (in himself) both male and female. Take the moment he, uh, comes to his breakthrough in chapter 4:....to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated...Now, I feel there's a fairly high probability an 18 year old on a romantic foreign holiday with her sexy poet husband knew perfectly well what she was writing about here, but I don't think we need to bicker about awareness to see foreplay, orgasm, and the little death. Progressive steps obliterated indeed.What's interesting, though, is the words before that: After so much time spent in painful labour...Labour, of course, being both work, and giving birth, and complicating Victor as man and as gestating woman. Throughout the creation of the monster, Victor uses labour; having inseminated himself, he must give birth. God creates man from nothing in a day; woman creates man* from man in 9 months. Poor Victor, working only with himself, labours to a two year term - and yet still is male:still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work [not labour, here] near to a conclusion....   *or woman, obviously.;Didn't occur to him along the way, didn't think about the consequences, didn't happen 5 mins earlier...You know, those absences happen a lot with teenagers and young men, except possibly for the 5 minutes earlier bit.;Interesting essay, although I think it might benefit from considering Dracula   s consummated male victims; he may rape women, but he destroys men. He kills two men that I recall, besides the crew of the ship, the retired sailor in Whitby & his foreign, and thus lower class, shipping agent in Galatz, both by ripping out their throats. He is, it seems, not interested in middle class men (though those intense male friendships, with Stoker so quick to reassure us they involve nothing more than a manly pat on the shoulder...). Given the role of rent boy rough trade in the Wilde trial, destroying the evidence - as well as the symbology of destructive homosexual desire in the excessive nature of the wounds (throats torn out, as if by a wild animal, not simply bitten, yet still in the same eroticised zone) - does make a certain amount of sense. I like the point Sean made earlier about the mix up between carnal and carnivorous, but I do think there are ways to read the book without necessarily queering the Count.That said, I think that looking forward to Freud's theories of sexual development, where certain stages have to be passed through before sexuality fastens on its proper object, the opposite sex, throws an interesting light on Dracula   s sexuality. You can certainly suggest the Count's desires are not completely gendered, and Helsing repeatedly describes him as having a child brain; he is sexually transgressive; and he can change shape. In short, as Mary suggested earlier, Freud's infantile polymorphous pervert.    ;I agree, Angela! I've actually enjoyed the book, but - even if you haven't liked it - I think it's worth listening to the Dracula lecture on words and the one on timelessness to see why it might be an important book.;Oh,  they work less these days. ;Our anonymous friend's joke can be read in (at least) two ways. One is the rather snide meaning I think you have picked out- that the working class are as inferior as ever; one is the rather more bitter observation - in line with my suggestion that the working class are disempowered in Dracula - that nothing has changed. A third interpretation is the long running (and frankly, perfectly justifiable) gag about the English & our drinking habits, one Stoker's friend Wilde also made: Work is the curse of the drinking classes. Any way Anon meant it, at the least I applaud the use of the feed line.As for my joke, there's a poisonous tendency in the mainstream political and social conversation in the UK at the moment (you may be British; I don't know) to classify working class people as striving or skiving - exactly the same as the Victorian deserving or undeserving; working hard or working less. The flip side of that is, again, the bitter truth that there simply aren't many working class jobs available anymore. In my area of the UK (Newcastle) unemployment outside the middle class bastions ran at 30-40% during the 80s, when the traditional industries of the area (coal mining & ship building) were gutted, & it's still 20% or more in the worst hit formerly working class areas. Working less, again.For what it's worth, I'd say that ""the working class"" or at least the socially disadvantaged, are openly legitimate targets in political and (public) social discourse in the UK in ways that are no longer tolerated for blacks or women - Chav, for example, if you know it, is a pretty vile term in wide use, and I already mentioned skivers. Not that I'm saying there isn't equal/worse discrimination displayed in other ways against the groups that you mention, mind.Sorry to bang on about it, but given that I had just written three paragraphs about the exclusion of the working class, I had thought I'd earned a slightly more charitable reading... :);The unsupervisedplay suggests they were definitely  working class - middle class children were much more circumscribed; look at Alice who must make her adventures inside her house and from a dream of running away. ;""People start believing...""  You mean they, the poor uncritical sheep, right, not us? Oddly, I find myself strangely uncharitable, right now, too.;Thanks for taking the time to reply, and accept my apology for being a bit grumpy today; it partly explains why I was offended by the bracketing with the kind of  us you imply, and why I didn't really appreciate being told I should factor in your encouragement, or lack of it, in my choice of topic - patronising, is how it reads.I tried a lengthy dissection, but think I am over-analysing. I see your point, although I don't wholly agree - because saying black people work less* entirely spoils the point of the joke about the working class working less. My joke was meant  to be satiric, and I'm sorry that wasn't clear enough in the original post. If you still read it a different way & are offended - I apologise, wholeheartedly; it's always a risk with satire. The first line was an (obviously failed, and unnecessarily snarky) attempt to try to point out how your words can be ungenerously interpreted, if someone so chose. You don't believe the stereotypes you refer to, so when you say  People... what you really mean is Other people (they) are stupid, can't think critically, and believe what they're told. Now who's making offensive generalisations? http://xkcd.com/610/ Anyway, I'll think a bit more about it; see if my ego is just up in arms at the moment. Apologies again.*edit: That is, I don't think there's a balancing counter-interpretation to the overtly racist stereotype of lazy black people to give the comment any satiric edge - it's just a nasty racist comment. Consider what happens if you substitute other groups; use women or gays, and the comment quickly becomes just weird, or stupid, because those groups have different associated stereotypes.   ;It should do now - and I know exactly the problem with forums; I come across as an over-analytic lecturing bore sometimes, and God knows how that happens. Pax?(Oh, and I did understand why you read it that way - which is why I wanted to clarify);Sorry to hear that, Yoly, though I don't know if this is the best place to talk about it. If you enjoy reading the book, I wouldn't worry too much about the essay, and just concentrate on finishing the book. Most of the other books are a bit shorter, so you may find them easier to finish. I'm guessing you're not a native English speaker, so you might find it a bit more challenging to get everything read and written. Just relax about it, and do what you can! I teach foreign students English, so I'm very impressed you're even trying - I know a lot of my students couldn't manage it. Good luck!;Yep, excellent essay. I can see your point about lack of clarity in the thesis, and I think you could possibly have developed her redemption (it is her husband to be who stakes her in the end) but I'd have probably given it 3 for form, and certainly for content. The comment about poor Georgie is an extremely astute piece of reading, and that's an elegant way of handling quotation without affecting the word count, one I'll be using in future.The essay prompted me to reconsider her name, actually. Westerner/Westenra ties in with the point you make about her somnabulism - western culture sleepwalking into danger - although that may have fallen outside the scope of your essay. The -ra, though, is interesting, since Ra is the Egyptian god of the sun, and her first name means light; I certainly think that is an example of Stoker ironising her chief characteristic, which is that everything happens to her at night (edit: just noticed a comment in another thread that her name could be read as light from the west - i.e. sunset. Much more   appropriate). More directly in line with your thesis, the etymological connection with Lucifer damns her from the start.Anyway, a successful essay. I do have a few minor quibbles - but given the storm & stress going on in rest of the assignments forum, feel free to ignore them. Briefly, it's actually four men who symbolically rape her (everyone has a go - Holmwood, Seward, Van Helsing, and Morris); I'm not sure about the word order in narrative Victorian determinacy (Victorian narrative determinacy, surely?); it's entendre, not ententre (brain slip, I'm sure); and I think, though the meaning is clear, the grammar of the last sentence of the second last paragraph is ambiguous - the opening participle clause has no clear referent, since the two closest nouns are Stoker and her behaviour. I apologise for the nitpicking; feels faintly churlish to do it in public.   Thanks for sharing.;Here's mine; I was in a hurry, so it was shamelessly plagiarised from a post I made in The Role of Christianity, https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=413 . I think the point about physical structure is valid, given the format, and I'd agree with the relevant reviewers that the conclusion is a bit weak - particular props to the reviewer who points out that I take on trust the importance of the soul; on consideration, there is something rather performatively excessive about the number of references made to the soul. There is at least one missing comma, and take a look at Sean Tobias May's essay just above for a better way of inserting quotes. In  Dracula, the primary horror of the undead state is not diet or  circumstance, but a Christian fear of damnation. Throughout the book,  the main motivation for the protagonists is the saving of souls rather  than lives.    This is evident in the events of the plot, the language and arguments  the characters use, and in how Dracula is portrayed explicitly as an  avatar of the devil, whose chief concern is the corruption of souls.  Considering Lucy   s second death, Helsing justifies it with reference to  the soul (   the soul of the poor lady  _ shall again be free   , Ch16) , and  this is instrumental in convincing Arthur to play his part - Lucy's soul  needs to be saved before it is tainted irrevocably by killing an  innocent. Likewise, Mina   s inevitable damnation is the reason the group  chase Dracula after he has left England (   The stake we play for is life  and death, or more than these   , Helsing, Ch. 25). This concern with soul  is also present in much of the dialogue. Throughout the book, all the  characters, and Helsing in particular, refer to the soul. In a telling  dialogue with Renfield, Seward discomfits Renfield with the notion of  the souls of creatures he consumes buzzing around him (   He dreads the    _burden of a soul"", Harker, Ch. 20 )     and it is shortly after this that  Renfield tries to break free from Dracula   s control. Finally, the clear  connection between Dracula and the devil himself, evident in both the  descriptive language used to describe the count (hellish; diabolical),  the root of his name (Romanian: Dracul, devil) and even his pseudonym in  London (de Ville) suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul,  not the body.    While Stoker   s relationship with scepticism, faith and Christianity  is complex, the metaphysical horror of the book for its original  audience comes from the damnation forced on the victim by the murderous  appetites of undeath.Formpeer 1      Clear thesis, but the second paragraph should be split up multiple ones  to make the physical structure as organized as the logical structure.  The sentences beginning with ""The concern of soul"" (missing an 's', by  the way) and ""Finally,"" both mark the beginning of related, but separate  thoughts.  peer 2     Very good essay, very well written, and the best of the five that I've evaluated this unit.peer 3      Clear, lucid prose. I have no suggestions other than perhaps a break in  the second paragraph would aid reading on a screen. Smaller paragraphs  are easier on the eyes.peer 4      This essay is very clear and well written. The vocabulary is powerful  and has a positive impact on the reader. The only phrase I found strange  was:suggest Dracula   s real threat, which is to the soul, not the body. I  would have written it like this: Dracula  s real threat is to the soul,  not the body.  It  s something minor anyway , this essay is very clear.peer 5     Althought there are some grammar mistakes they don't impede the reading. The essay is clear and well-organised.(2)Contentpeer 1      Good thoughts that are well supported, but I thought the conclusion was  sort of weak. It essentially restates the beginning paragraph, without  any new information to enhance it. peer 2      I liked your argument, and you supported it well. You're right in that  we tend to think of how the book affects us, and not how it affected  contemporary audiences.peer 3      This was the most insightful essay I've read yet in this course. A  clear thesis is backed up by ample evidence (though no evidence is given  that for the original audience, the idea of damnation was more horrific  than vampirism itself.) Strong writing.peer 4      I liked the argument very much. The author has given very specific  examples from the text and makes quite a compelling case. Well done!peer 5      I really like how you connect your main ideas with extracts from the  book, because it is clearer to understand. Very interesting connection  not only with Christianity, but also with Christian fears.(3 - generous, I think);Thanks for posting that quote, P. Klein. Interesting, and certainly matches themes in the 1831 edition I'm reading. ;I wrestled with this issue a bit. The suggested Google edition is scanned and horribly typo'd; I found it pretty unreadable. I looked at the Amazon text (which is definitely the 1818 one) but found a proofread version of the 1831 text on Gutenberg Press. This is the link:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324  and there is a mobi file available for the kindle. The introduction is quite interesting, actually, and worth reading. Shelley says she made some minor changes to the style of the first few chapters, but I don't know how significant they are. ;Just getting started, and having read through the intro and the letters, I noticed a lot of references to Coleridge's Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner. The letter writer makes reference to the poem explicitly, and Vincent's role - warning Walton about the dangers he faces - is similar to that of the Mariner in the poem. I found something vaguely familiar about the iceberg scene, but couldn't quite place it, and won't have time to look at the poem until later. Just wondering if anyone has anything more concrete on the connection, or more generally on Shelley and Coleridge.Looking forward, also, I was struck by the book's relationship to A Wizard of Earthsea (by Ursula K. Le Guin, who we're reading later, and if you're doing this course and haven't read it, that should be the very first book you pick up after the course finishes). Like Frankenstein (and also with echoes of Dracula) Ged tries, hubristically, to bring forth life, or at least truly resurrect a dead person, but ends up with a monster who he then has to chase to the ends of the world. Curious echo.;In the end, I actually developed my thesis influenced by the ending of  the Wizard of Earthsea, and thinking about the importance of names, both  symbolically and as essential parts of our social identity.;I was trying to avoid spoilers,  but the (actually not quite core) story of the cloned worker is the one I was thinking of; life created without care for the life itself. ;Hello Royce! Yes, that's an interesting observation, although the nesting is more complex in Cloud Atlas. Did your friend also tell you that the monster's great great grand-daughter is hidden in the core of the book? It's worth reading if you get the chance, although I'd also recommend one of his other books, Ghostwritten. The science-fictional aspects of both are fairly bleak, however!Following on from my initial observation, I've been trying to identify some of the influences and allusions in the book, although exploring them in any depth is a hopeless task given the time constraints. I hope one of the lectures will deal with the references! Anyway, a few more:Faust (both Goethe and Marlowe) - occultists like the young Frankenstein, and archetypal investigators into things what man was not meant to wot.Shakespeare - The Tempest, in particular, Prospero (a master of magical arts who shuts himself away insolitude for study, abandoning his duties) & Caliban (the monster), and Prospero and Miranda (compare the monster watching the cottagers, who, like the washed ashore characters of the Tempest, are actually nobility, made wretched, with Miranda:   How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in't!) Hamlet, the very model of the modern miserable intellectual gets a look in too, with echoes of his despair and guilt present in Victor.Paradise Lost, very obviously.Childe Harold, I am fairly sure, though it has been a long time since I read it.The romantic poets, generally, and in a host of ways - the importance of nature, imagination, and solitude being just 3 I picked out, and empathy/sympathy has just occurred to me. Austen - Mansfield park gets a specific reference (pretty Miss Mansfield...) in the letter about Justine's history, although I am unsure whether the following clause (her ugly sister Manon (Mammon) has married the banker) is a gag about what Austen's novels are about underneath the pretty surface, or a reference to another novel; Austen's domestic, tiny worlds are lightly mocked in the introduction; and there seems to be a mild anxiety of influence at play - although judging by the comments in the Drama Queen thread, it's pretty clear Austen's won that particular challenge....and I'm sure there's many, many more.;Good post, John. That solitude is a key issue, and I think it's an interesting one to consider in the context of her original audience; writers & romantics who laid great importance on solitude, especially in nature. A cautionary tale, perhaps?;Hello Laurie!Like Florencia, I'm afraid I have quite the opposite problem! I'm not quite sure if Florencia means she will be doing a close analysis of a particular incident (e.g. looking at the moment when Frankenstein & the monster meet, and thinking about how this incident reflects wider themes, or discussing the marked change in language in this section) or picking out a single word (or a group of related words) and discussing how they are used throughout the book, but if you're ever stuck for ideas, these are both good approaches.Some of the ideas I've been considering:Weather - You might look at the differences between the moments when the weather is calm, and those when it is violent. You could also consider how Frankenstein's moods are reflected in or described by the weather - he is forever raging like a storm or a whirlwind, or shrouded in a fog of despair.Nature - At the beginning of the book, Victor sees nature as something to be conquered (the root of Victor, in fact), but he becomes ever more sympathetic to nature - his moment of peace, before he meets the monster for the first time, is found in the mountains. Nature and its enjoyment was a key concept for the Romantic poets, too. Connected with that is the travelogue elements of the book - reading it, I suddenly wanted to visit the alps.Sociality vs. Solitude - Victor embraces (in many different ways...) solitude throughout the book,and especially at University, (in a city - a place reliant on social, but not familial, relationships) but the monster sees solitude as terrible. Bearing in mind the original audience, a group of poets and writers, you can see the book as a cautionary tale about Solitary Vices. Fancy & the imagination- These words crop up again and again in the book, and they are words very strongly associated with the Romantic poets Shelley was involved with. There are ways you can see Victor as a frustrated poet, not a scientist. Walton, his framing parallel, tries and fails to be a poet; Victor occasionally describes what he does as art, not science; and the monster describes language as a science when he is learning it. Chimeric, a word we use now for illusion, is a reference to a fantastical monster made of many parts, and this, too, crops up a lot. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_%28mythology%29  Desire & knowledge - For both Victor and the monster the pursuit of knowledge is highly sexualised - look at how of the word ardent/ardently/ardour (passionate) are used for their studies. I discussed this a bit in the drama queen thread already, and it connects with the themes the Professor as already drawn our attention to, about the dangers of knowledge, its sexualisation, and its connection with notions of the fall and so on. Prometheus - the subtitle is The Modern Prometheus. You might like to consider the original Prometheus myths and its variants, and the ways in which Victor does & doesn't resemble Prometheus - you could even argue that aspects of the monster echo Prometheus. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus )If I have time, I'll put some observations about names up later (good spot on Felix, Florencia!) John Graham has posted some interesting things about justice, guilt, and shame, and if I was fantastically learned and had 3 weeks, I'd certainly discuss literary allusion in the book - but there's much more - the relationship of parent and child, the narrative structure, the importance of the word daemon...Anyway, hope that helps! Good luck with the essay.;A bit late, but now I've finished and fled from my Creature - maybe not hideous, but perhaps hideously boring - I'd point out that you can both be right. Although I don't think the monster is  literally Satan, he certainly claims a satanic status, and Victor, while still believing himself the creator, fantasizes about throwing the monster from precipes, from cliffs - the Satanic fall. Yet by the end of the book, Victor himself identifies with Satan: Like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.;The same.I am actually an EFL teacher, so I'm fairly tolerant about form, especially if I am certain the writer is a foreign student of English. It's worth noting that it is perfectly possible for a student to succeed at a university course with less than perfect English; content matters more than form for most university courses, and even English related courses do not expect native level English from students. Cambridge University, for example, asks for an 8 at IELTS (the academic English exam used for entrance to most British universities) for linguistics and literature MAs, and less for other courses. 9 is native speaker level (and some native speakers would struggle to qualify :D) - at 8, ""some errors do persist"" and the IELTS writing descriptor asks for ""the majority"" (not all) sentences to be constructed accurately. In terms of this course, it should be perfectly possible for a well structured and coherent essay from a foreign speaker to get at least a 2. That said, if it causes you as much difficulty as you suggest, 1 is the best mark.One other thing - while systematic errors like the missing -s  might be noticeable, that is not always a good guide to the seriousness of the error. The -s, in particular, along with irregular past tenses, are notoriously difficult areas for most students, and even otherwise extremely high level speakers (i.e., band 8, & good enough to study English Literature at Cambridge University) sometimes make these mistakes. This is because English is irregularly and only partially inflected, and it is especially difficult for speakers from languages with virtually no inflection, like Chinese. Articles and prepositions are other areas that people often fuss about, but again, these are areas that cause all except very high level learners problems - and yet rarely detract from the meaning. A few people have talked about the difficulties of grading foreign language students. If you are genuinely interested in doing justice to non-native speaker essays (and good for you if you are!) , I'd take a look at the IELTS band descriptors - http://www.ielts.org/pdf/UOBDs_WritingT2.pdf . Anything at 7 or above with a strong structure and good organisation should, in my opinion, be at least a contender for a 2.      ;...native speakers struggling to have a good score in the IELTS should tell you something about the validity of the test.Yes. It tells me that some native English speakers do not fully understand and are not able to produce university level discourse. This cannot be a complete surprise, surely..?  In the writing section,  accuracy is not the only criterion - most non-academic native writing would do less well due to lack of grammatical range, inappropriate vocabulary, and poor structure.    For what it's worth, I state explicitly that band 7 - a grade that will get you into most universities in the UK - is on the way to a 2. ;This, pretty much, given the context.;"

Can you point me to the course rubric that says so?Personally, I'm using footnotes [1] (linked to the citations section) for both references and longer quotes simply because the word count is so tight, and, given the nature of the course, provided a writer has some consistent method of telling me where a quote comes from & what material is not their own, I see no reason to insist on a particular method, inline or not. The essays themselves are  not  written for casual readers - they're written for fellow students on the course, and since they're so short, even with the citations section included, I think this method is sufficiently clear.  I agree with your point about indicating the particular text you're using, especially if it's different from the suggested one, however.  [1] Like this.  ;Very useful, Florencia - thanks for sharing. I'm struggling to find a foothold in the Hawthorne; after Frankenstein, the stories seem a bit shallow. Maybe this will help!;A few other points I've considered.First, the figure of the Artist. Hawthorne is (thumpingly) clear that the protagonist of AoB is an artist, and the work there is creation rather than modification as it is in the scientific stories. It's, significantly, the last story in the edition we're using (although only the second last in the original text, tho' I need to check the relation of the version we have and the original), and there are obvious ways in which the artist's creations mirror what Hawthorne wants to do with his stories. This inter-textual, justificatory theme is there in Rappucini's daughter, too - the purported author, Aubepine, is described at length, but Aubepine is French for Hawthorn, and the titles of Aubepine's purported works (Le Voyage Celeste a Chemin de Fer = The Celestial Railroad, one of the other stories in the collection, and L'Artiste du Beau ou le Papillon Mecanique is also very plain). In both these stories, Hawthorne is telling us how to read his stories, and there may be other similar moments in the other stories.Time (& Life/Death) Certainly in RD & AoB, time vs timelessness is both thematic and symbolised. In RD, there's a detail about a statue the god vertumnus - Roman god of plants & also seasons -   being overgrown suggesting, to me at least, that the garden is a little outside the flow of time. Only intrusion into the garden brings time with it - and, although I haven't fully thought it through, I think it's important that the plants are blooming rather than fruiting (i.e. pre generative). Flowers are certainly a symbol of evanescence, something they share with butterflies. In AoB, however, the time theme is made very clear, and there's something paradoxical in the notion of a mechanical (not mortal) butterfly - and it is destroyed by the baby, whose link with time is also explicit.Connecting those, it's also worth noting Hawthorne was explicitly interested in creating a mythology for the US. I think back to the lecture on time in Dracula and the different kinds of timelessness (eval time and mythic time) an artist or story can aspire to. Both AoD & RD resemble fairy tales, and represent a play for the mythic time - that is, archetypal, and beyond the date of their composition. This is especially true in the structure of RD where we have a beautiful woman, a handsome prince, and so on, as well as the echoes of Rapunzel in the name, the garden (Rapunzel begins with the wife's craving for the witch's plants) and what seems an inversion to me of the structure - the man looking down and descending, instead of looking up and ascending. For what it's worth, the fineness of a watchmaker's work as well as the opposition of wit and brawn in AoB also remind me of the tailor character in fairy tales. ;@Florencia. I'm honestly not sure, but I mean the sound of the name; I hear both as beginning /Ra.puh/.(that is, schwa) though one is /Ra.'puhn.zel/ and the other /Ra.puh.'chee.nee/, and I'm not completely sure about the stress on Rapaccini. Not exactly p;Excellent! Don't know why it didn't occur to me to google them myself - and it's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.;Oh, and on reaching the end of the story again, I noticed that Prof B. announces Rapaccini! Rappacini! ;  I like it, although Beatrice is never actually known - a meaning of known the professor doesn't mention in the lecture...;One other tidbit I discovered, during time that might have been better spent writing the essay, was that Eugene Sue, mentioned in the introduction to the story, is - according to wiki - the source for the maxim  Revenge is a dish best served cold. How's THAT for the upshot of the experiment?   ;It's possible peer 1 picked up on a couple of the minor flaws, although - without examples - it's equally possible they were talking through their hat; it's a full & interesting essay, one that would certainly have got 3 for content from me.Form:Overall your English is extremely good, but there are a couple of nitpicks; none detract from the meaning.In     Wretch    the noun  &     wretched    the adjective, I think you would be better off using commas, since you are giving additional, non-determining, information (as in relative clauses).For  as the wretched, my instinct is you either need a noun (one) or no the, but I can see the parallelism you were trying for.Up to the first half  should be  in the first half or up to the end of the first half, since up to implies a point.For style, I'd agree with peer 2 that you handle the informal style very well, although I would warn you it's a risky gambit in academic writing - some of the more, uh, demanding reviewers might take issue with it. Connected with that, I would definitely avoid using And  or But  to begin sentences; I think usage is shifting, but in general, this is discouraged in academic writing. Content:  I picked out wretch as a key term, and I think you do a good job of describing its importance. To develop your point, you might like to consider its connection in sound and spelling to wreck, another term which appears frequently in  Frankenstein, as verb, noun, and adjective. The two words in fact share a root, the Old English wreccan - which means, suggestively, to exile or drive out, and links to wreak, as in wreak vengeance.  If you're interested in focusing on words, I'd highly recommend   http://www.etymonline.com/index.php  ; it's very useful, and an acceptable source for citation  -   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Etymology_DictionaryI think you could also have usefully added that Frankenstein falls to  the wretched  state, a connection with the Satanic themes of the book.;Oh, one other point - demon is the evil one, but daemon  is a bit more complex. Exercise left for the reader :);Mine - a bit limited in some ways, and I missed the opportunity to use the word  patronymic, the broader connection between irony and the reversals of the book (Victor's move from creator to Satan), and the neat closing gag about the Monster taking Frankenstein's name in popular imagination. Nobody commented on the slightly awkward use of transgress, or  what I see as the  biggest flaws, the over-use of irony &  the lack of development in the last paragraph. I'd also  have liked to expound a bit on Waldman, who also has phonic & archetypal  echoes - in his concern with fame and his rationalist willingness to accept the value of even occult knowledge -  of the allegorical character, Mr. Worldly. Anyway, my lumbering monster:EssayAdam   s first duty was to name the creatures of the world, and naming is always a powerful act. The names in  Frankenstein  serve symbolic and ironizing purposes, but also suggest the wider significance of naming itself.  Victor, for example, means conqueror [1], and to conquer is to trangress the borders of one   s own country and those of another. This is what Victor wishes     to exceed the boundaries of the mortal, and trespass in God   s realm. However, the name is ironized by the events of the novel, with Victor conquered by the monster, and, as with any conquered person, enslaved [2]. This is echoed in the etymology of his surname, with  Frank  originally meaning free[3].  Other characters also have symbolic, ironized names. Elizabeth is    promised to God   [4] and she is sworn to Victor, an aspiring creator, from an early age, but, as with nuns promised to God, she is virginal when the monster murders her. Justine, derived from justice, receives no such thing. Even minor characters are named in suggestive or ironic ways.  Wald  is German for forest, where characters get lost, and it is Waldman who ""smoothed the path of knowledge""[5] for Victor   s dangerous endeavours. Felix, happiness, is described by the monster as a model of familial, and, once Safie arrives, social happiness, and then bitterly ironised when the monster frames Justine. [6]  Yet, besides these symbolic echoes, names also serve an essential purpose of identification. Familial relationships are described by names, and personal names are given to us by our parents to identify us within the family and to the wider world[7]; without names, we cannot fully function in society. Though Victor calls his creature devil, fiend, and monster, he will not do his fatherly duty and acknowledge their relationship, or give the monster a name. That namelessness, and the lack of social identity it implies, is itself a symbol of the dreadful solitude to which the monster feels condemned.

You're clearly someone of great personal style & judgement.

My topic turned out to be a little more complex and, I think, a little less central than I imagined, but never mind. Curious to know if anyone else considered narrative voice in the other Hawthorne stories, L'Artiste du Beau in particular. Essay Rappaccini's Daughter is a story about many things, but our understanding of it and our ability to pull a single meaning from the tale is complicated even further by the unreliable narrative voice.   The story begins with an introduction in which a narrator claims the story was actually written by one Aubepine (French for hawthorn), and whose book titles closely mirror Hawthorne's other stories in the collection[1], yet this sets up a confusion. If Aubepine is a figure for Hawthorne, who, then, has translated the story into English and written this deprecating introduction describing his works as    wearisome    and without    human warmth   ?   Within the tale itself, the narrator     either Aubepine or the purported translator    makes several obvious platitudinous interjections, signalled by a switch to the present tense, and is very keen to tell us how to assess the characters. However, his first direct interjection [2] is shown to be wrong through the later events of the tale     the influence of morning does not change the fact of Beatrice's poison; Giovanni was correct in his first impression. His second interjection [3] notes that both dark and light emotions have their place, but it is the mixture that is problematic. It is hard, however, to see horror as a blessed emotion.  What's more, this intensely binary view contradicts the portrayal of Beatrice as a mixture     both animal and vegetable, both unquestionably good and unquestionably deadly. Nor, despite the narrator's frequent assertions that she is an    angel   , is Beatrice herself entirely guiltless. She is happy enough to take Giovanni's affection, despite knowing that it cannot be consummated [4]. Our narrator, who is very clear about Giovanni's failures, is silent on this.     By removing authorial authority and then complicating the narrative voice itself, Hawthorne forces us to take a more sophisticated reader's eye to the story. What is apparently an allegory or an allusive fairy-tale begins to look a more human confusion of misinterpretation, motive, and meaning.   [1]  For example, L'Artiste du Beau . [2] But there is an influence in the light of morning that tends to rectify whatever errors of fancy, or even of judgement, we may have incurred during the sun's decline... [3]Blessed are all simple emotions, be they dark or bright! It is the lurid intermixture of the two that produces the illuminating blaze of the infernal regions.   [4] I dreamed only to love thee, and be with thee a little time, and so to let thee pass away, leaving but thine image in mine heart   ;And thank you for your kind remarks; glad you liked it. I worry a bit about how interesting other people might find very focused topics, but unreliable narrators have been a theme of the course. I hope you'll post your essay, too, once the evaluation is over. I had trouble (despite making a lot of notes on Rappaccini's daughter) persuading the various images and allusions to cohere, as well as with the narrator's antipathy to Giovanni - who, after all, is only a lonely young man prey to the urges of all young men; not too dissimilar to Beatrice, in fact.Research is a bit flattering though - my google fu is strong, nothing more. :);Depends, I would say. If the essay is clear in the links to the stories we did read, consider giving them a 2. Otherwise, I suppose you would have to give them a one - but explain why you did so in the comments.;Yes - none for me this week, since I didn't submit in time - but I can imagine. Pessimistically, over-reliance on stories we weren't asked to read is probably grounds for a careful plagiarism check, too.;I agree with Emma,  though I would broaden the cultural claim to at least the English language,  and in outline, virtually all of Europe. The Bible is the one text almost every pre 20th century literate English speaking person would have read,  probably multiple times,  and a majority of people, literate or not,  would have had to listen to interpretation of texts from the bible at least once a week. What's more,  the bible in English - and the King James bible in particular - has had a direct effect on the diction of the language itself.  Comparisons to other works are potentially valid, although run the risk of irrelevance. Because of its centrality to pre-twentieth c cultural development,  the bible is almost never irrelevant - and the act of criticism itself owes enormously to traditions of biblical exegesis.   @ anon, I don't know what part of the world you come from,  but getting a nodding acquaintance with key stories in the bible (and preferably the King James) will help enormously in understanding some aspects of pre and early modern English literature.;apologies  for the awful formatting; tech not playing nice. ;No,  the mythological stores are also important, but come from different sources,  mostly Greek via the Romans. Robert Grave's The Greek Myths offers reasonable retelling of most of them,  but his interpretations are very questionable . Unlike the bible,  there's no single retelling that is absolutely essential; Wikipedia,  however,  will give you the general idea of most of the stories, and a translation of Ovid's metamorphoses will give you something a bit closer to the original. You'll be able to find plenty of children's versions I'm sure,  but they often tend to skip the death and sex.  Don't try and read the whole of the bible,  mind,  unless you're really keen - it's a tough slog -  and if it does get too much,  again Wikipedia or children's versions will give you the general idea. There's plenty of free modernised versions of the bible online,  too.;Yep - your analogy makes it clear, Florencia. I also noted in another thread that using stories outside the course possibly warrants, depressingly, a careful plagiarism check, since a cut-out-and-keep essay is less likely to focus on exactly the stories suggested.That said, Masque of the Red Death is one of the Poe stories. It's heavily anthologized, and I think fairly widely known. It's also pretty good; put it on the reading list for the end of the course, maybe?;"

In the country of the blind, the religion & belief system of the blind is presented as perfectly logical within the limits of their four senses, but also completely wrong; they believe birds (which they cannot perceive) to be angels, and they fall back to the ancient belief that the sky is basically a ceiling. ;Man is the tool using and making animal,  and for that,  our sensitive fingers &  thumbs are invaluable. Moreau states explicitly he has problems with the hands, and I think there are (at least) two aspects to it Wells want us to notice - the importance of hands for manipulation,  for making (surgery),  as a sign of the human, as well as the proto religious instinct which identifies Moreau as the maker and so divine image - where the closer you get to the form of the visible god,  obviously, the more enlightened you are. ;Thanks for the reminder; while I agree with you about comparative biology & wasn't perhaps clear enough in saying Wells wants us to notice this rather than necessarily believe it, I think we can agree that for most readers the statement man is the tool using animal (which a quick google tells me comes from Thomas Carlyle - the potted bio is intriguingly relevant http://quotationsbook.com/quotes/author/1322/ ) is - even now - superficially convincing, while Humans, along with octopi, chimps, bonobos, some kinds of birds, and possibly a few others, are the tool using animals lacks a certain man-on-the-street snap. I certainly think that there's at least some difference of magnitude of in the tool use, too; the connection with tool making is also to do with some of the racist/colonial themes of the book - it was a staple of the British Imperial mindset that the inferiority of other races was evidenced in their inferior tools; the tools may have been perfectly adequate for the situation, but the fact that other peoples had not developed, e.g., the revolver, was proof positive of their inferiority. I think I might I agree with your point about religion, though I may have misunderstood what you're getting at, and I'm not so sure about your argument. I was posting in a hurry, and just describing the theme - but images of the divine really are often very strongly anthropomorphised (and I don't think sticking an animal head on top really cuts it to get away from that - tho' in the context of Victiorian Egyptomania, it's a possibly relevant connection) - Giants in Norse myth are humanoid; Dionysus is described as a (very pretty) adolescent; against Ganesh, you can put Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva etc - again, a few extra arms neither here nor there. With the exceptions of the dragons, virtually the entire Chinese pantheon is explicitly anthropomorphic (as in heaven, so on earth) and, living in Asia, I can assure you that Buddhism the religion rather than Buddhism the philosophy is very keen on the human image; it's not 30 foot lotus flowers or a big hole that make the centrepiece of Buddhist temples, generally. I don't think that's because they think the human form is irrelevant to notions of the divine.Comparative religion aside, I agree that the satire is primarily shaped by Christian notions; the Maker; the Law; the fathering/creation aspect of it. I can't remember if the text talks explicitly about how the beast men treat the different number of fingers, but the creature (is he a gorilla? I only remember him being described as ""monkey"") who counts the narrator's fingers is concerned with status - isn't he the one who adopts the narrator's ""Big Thinks""? Wells draws an explicit comparison to priest talk later in the book. More broadly, however, I don't think Wells is singling out Christianity, beyond the fact that's what he knew; underlying the book is a bleak, mechanistic universe shaped by an awareness that evolution precludes the need for any god at all. The narrator states towards the end, just before Moreau (the god figure) dies:A blind fate, a vast pitiless Mechanism seemed to cut and shape the fabric of existence...and the epilogue suggests he never really gets away from that.Interesting you mention Lovecraft, though - my note for that quote simply says  Lovecraft. ;"

So much in these fairy tales occurs in threes, that it leads me to wonder if there is something inherently more satisfying for the storyteller and reader when something is not once, not twice, but three times. Do we just prefer the rhythm it creates? Very curious.;I see what you're saying, Marla, and I suppose that's true, but what has really struck me isn't just that 3 is a popular number for characters, but it is also predominately the number of times an action is repeated or an event occurs. Almost as if an event only happened once, it wouldn't be significant; twice could be a coincidence; four times is overkill     but 3! That's the perfect number to convey significance.;Martha, that is great insight! Really helpful. That makes excellent sense to me and helps explain why we would intuitively find patterns of three more interesting than others.

Inevitably, the outside world finds them and their peaceful existence is disrupted.The exception seems to be ""Hansel and Grethel"" where the house appears to offer them relief from their hunger but is really just a sweet trap.;I know this is last minute, but that's how I do things, I suppose. I'm still knocking around in my head which essay theme to pursue and it occurred to me that many, many of these tales hinge on a barter that goes bad in some fashion. Sometimes, it's a trade in which one of the characters clearly gets the upper hand; other times, the swap is a chance for the reader to laugh at the poor trading skills of a character; and then there are the cheats who somehow squelch on a trade.It'd be safe to say that bartering and trading were essential and commonplace back when these stories were popular, wouldn't it?;Professor Rabkin knows more than I do probably on almost anything, but after hearing his lecture on ""Hansel and Grethel,"" I have to cry foul to his use of back story. His foundation for arguing that Grethel had an illicit desire to kill and supplant her mother is shaky at best. More than that, though, the back story angle is out of bounds, I think. Should I be able to add back story to any character in a story in order to buttress my argument? It would certainly make things easier at times. It's not using the text to make your case and it seems like an illegitimate move to me.;I understand the Freudian critique and while I'm not sold on it, I won't argue its legitimacy as an analysis technique.

I've re-read it a couple times I'm not sure what the reviewers caught that I'm missing. Thanks!Science is suspect in early 19th-century literature as evidenced by Mary Shelley   s Frankenstein (1818) and Nathaniel Hawthorne   s short stories    The Birthmark    and    Rappaccini   s Daughter,    which appear in Mosses from an Old Manse (1846). The point of suspicion originates not in the pursuit of science itself, however, but in a deep fear of an obsessive, all-consuming pursuit of science that pays little if any heed to consequences. Both Shelley and Hawthorne paint portraits of scientists whose total absorption in their scientific work leads to dire unintended results: Shelley   s Frankenstein produces a monster while Hawthorne   s Aylmer murders his beloved and Rappaccini slays his daughter. Indeed, Hawthorne writes that Rappaccini    cares more for science than for mankind    and describes Aylmer as having a    love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy.     Obsession, Shelley and Hawthorne seem to argue, is a path to tragic and horrific ends.  But Hawthorne reveals a bias when in his story    The Artist of the Beautiful     he depicts an artist   s peculiar obsession with    putting spirit into machinery    as producing an instance of beauty, thereby transforming a dangerously obsessive preoccupation into a noble and artistic pursuit. Hawthorne characterizes Owen Warland   s obsessed personality as    being of thought, imagination, and keenest sensibility.        Hawthorne is clear. When driven by a singularly focussed passion and curiosity without concern for consequence, the scientist risks engendering death and disaster; in fact, creating the antithesis of beauty. In    The Birthmark,    it is Aylmer   s attempt through scientific methods to produce ideal beauty that leads to the death of Georgiana. In contrast, the artist driven by a singularly focussed passion and curiosity without concern for consequence can    create the beautiful.    The compulsion and drive may be the same for the scientist and the artist, Hawthorne appears to conclude, but only one pursuit has the power to produce a true representation of beauty.

Great way to put it in a story. Happy reading :);Hey Lauren,While I understand your concern and I've mentioned using Freud's interpretations in other forums, some psychoanalitic theories have proved to be useful in understanding narrations. The professor cites the author Bruno Bettelheim, who explores these theories and their applications in different stories. When we deal with interpreting a work of art, such as literature, using a recognized framework of thought and interpretation gives more security to our own claims and interpretations. You mention how baffled you are by people using these frameworks, whereas I'd rather to be more tolerant with others' interpretations and their use of frameworks from different fields. I imagine that others may not be as cognizant in the works of Marx, Levi, Strauss and others. People in general -myself included-   could be more familiar with Freud's Framework and use it because the metaphors are a bit more obvious. Bear in mind that some of us are approaching interpretation of literature for the first time and we don't know if there is a right or wrong philosophical approach to read these stories.;Well, you are not alone in wishing to hear from other frameworks. I am a psychologist and even as such I've tried to avoid Freudian interpretations in my essays. Nonetheless, it is sort of difficult to think of different themes to interpret the text. While reading Dracula, I struggled to   find original themes that did not have to do with sex or Freudian symbolism as I thought it would not be as enlightening as other sort of motifs.;That is what I understood as well Daniel.

Most of us want to learn and improve, but the fear of failing the course is preventing some of us from enjoying the ride and improving our writing.;A flag can be done in the comments section and in it appears it can be done on essays as well. A flag is to disagree with someone or point out their behavior is rude or against the rules. The green points on the forums means voting up one opinion when they agree with a point that is made on the post. They don't have any other meaning. Not everyone votes on the posts people make that's why most post have 0 :);This is a great discussion John and I like your last phrase. In your original post you mention sympathy and justice and it's interesting how both concepts are interrelated. For me, I could feel sympathy for someone but that does not make me justify the person's actions. A person is to be deemed responsible for their behavior.Now, this was a child monster without any sort of education and upbringing. It makes me think of the cases when children have been lost and raised by animals, as he had a limited contact with the human race. What I'm trying to say is that personal situations sometimes makes you look at moral codes of society from a different perspective. It does not necessarily mean that justice should not be applied in his case, but his individual circumstances are able to raise people's sympathy and understanding. ;Thanks for that Andreja. I have the exact same issue and was failed in Form because of it. The problem sometimes is that when you add spaces it gets too spaced and when you take then out it looks convoluted. I've tried both ways and it was difficult to find a balance. I guess I'll have to preview at least three times with upcoming essays.;I agree Constance, the monster's argument was compelling. It is a sad story and one keeps wondering if things could have been different if the ""monster"" was only allowed the possibility of feeling like a human being. I felt much more empathy for the ""monster"" than for Frankenstein.;I agree with you Paul, it might have been best to leave it at pass or fail. Yet I disagree in that students err on being generous. It has not been the case with my reviewers at least. Even though I realize my essays have flaws and are the result of a quick analysis, as it is my first time reading these books.  I constantly get Fail in either Form or Content from at least more than one peer. That is, I get a score of one for mere details. These details are things like the spacing of paragraphs given by the software of coursera, - which is out of my control - or when the peer thinks the thesis is too general or not that original or enlightening. It is near impossible coming up with an interpretation that hasn't been thought out before, specially if I'm no expert on literary analysis. I've seriously given better grades than the ones I've received for essays that have more mistakes and aspects that need improvement. Sometimes people tend to mark down instead of marking up, specially if they're given the same treatment by other peers. They try to find mistakes to justify the score they assign. A score of One seems generous to some people, not realizing that a score of One is equivalent to a Fail. All in all, I am preparing for the possibility of failing this course even if I turn in all my essays and make a great effort on them. At least I know I will learn ""something"" from people's feedback. Even if it's just a general view of human nature and students' behaviors when grading people they have never met and may never meet. Could this lead to generosity and a genuine interest in helping others? Or could it lead to competitiveness and downgrading others? We'll see.;I agree with you Ratka. I am also doing the Brown University course of The Fiction of Relationship. It is my first time doing these courses and even though we have peer reviews in the Fiction of Relationship course, students don't get penalized by this system. Instead, you only need to turn in a ""valid"" essay in order to receive a Statement of Accomplishment.Now, I know that Statements of Accomplishment may not mean much. But psychologically they do. I don't need a certificate, but I want to feel my effort is being appreciated. It is important to note that people also fear failure. They don't want to feel like they failed an online course, so I understand if they prefer dropping out.In addition, some people perceive virtual ""peer review"" as unfair. It is also different when peer review is used in a classroom, when you know the students. There is a face to face component that makes fellow student more able to empathize with their classmates. But in a virtual environment the ability to empathize is diminished and people is not afraid to show their ""dark side."" Specially when the system is not properly regulated and is Anonymous.;Hey Lauren,I agree with your comments in that it is best to focus on the whole of the essay and the points you are trying to make. However, as a non-native speaker I can relate to reviewers who make these mistakes. I am sure I make these as well. Yet, it seems a bit unkind to review the review.  Most of us are already making an effort - not always rewarded- by crafting the essays. The reviews are an additional effort and they are not always planned and carefully constructed. Nonetheless, I would not blame someone - native or non-native speaker- for not articulating exactly what they mean in their reviews.;Just wanted to point out that I agree with all your suggestions. I was merely referring to the grammar when giving feedback. Not all of us are experienced professionals in giving feedback and may find particularly difficult to point out the aspects that need improvement using proper language, grammar and punctuation. The options of providing a space for feedback and learning resources to improve the way we give feedback could prove useful in making the coursera experience more valuable for students who are struggling to keep up the pace with more experienced professionals. Specially considering non-native speakers that are not accustomed to having to identify mistakes in structure, grammar and language. ;There seems to be a misunderstanding in the Forums regarding the scores for Form, Content and the difference with the Total Score produced by the system. The difference relies in the mechanics used to calculate the average required to receive a State of Accomplishment. For instance, some students think they are doing well when receiving a Score of 3, when they are actually failing.On the other hand, some peer reviewers assign scores of 1 for pure details and they don't realize that they are actually assigning a Score of Fail   without providing sufficient reason for it. The structure of the course and the pacing seems challenging for most people, but some are willing to make the effort. However, this effort is not translated in results when adding the complicated scoring system and how different people interpret it. It would be helpful if the staff could clarify the following statement: ""If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and  Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will  have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of  Accomplishment.""The calculations are also discussed in this thread: https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=408 The statement implies that the Total Score should be of 4 - or an approximate of 3.6 - Thus, for Form or Content, 1= Failed, 2 = Passed and 3 = Above Expectations. I invite reviewers to take note of these differences and strive for fairness when scoring essays.;Hey Paul,I Understand this distinction. I have read opinions in forums where there seems to be a misunderstanding about these. I was only trying to look for a clarification from the Staff, who has failed to provide this clarification for everyone to understand. As you pointed out previously, the scores have another particularity as the are calculated from the Median and not   the average of Peer Scores. There is also a reason why the percentages in which each score should be  assigned are discussed in the course syllabus and that's also  considered in the assertions I make. My main post has been voted down and I suspect this thread will soon disappear like the others, so I guess it is not valid to ask questions about these issues. I was only hoping that the coursera community would provide help instead of voting down a request for clarification. A clarification from the Staff would have been perceived as more accurate and valid from all peers, so that's what I was looking for, in spite of my opinion and invitation to consider the reasons behind a score of 1. Oh well, all for naught. People who vote down and don't comment are like reviewers who fail essays and don't provide feedback. If they disagree with what I'm saying they could argument the points I'm making, even if they remain in anonymity. But after all, Haters are going to hate and Trolls are going to troll.;The overall grade average if you are talking about Total Score for each essay should be of 3.6.;I noticed it right away, so cute :);"

I received 1.5 one time, so I think I only had 4 reviewers that time as there is no way to get decimals with 5 reviewers according to this. I hope next times I have at least 5 reviewers.;I agree with you Emma. We may be too sensitive and unprepared to argue with reviewers. I've found in these discussions that sometimes people get your points and understand your argument but sometimes they feel offended and think you are out there to attack people - not ideas. A story has many readings and language has many layers. To add to this, we all come from totally different backgrounds and life situations. What some people consider being rude, others take it as a normal way of expressing concern. I am not ashamed to say that my posts have been voted down in countless occasions even when I have not been offensive, yet my words and arguments tend to be too assertive.Discussing as an intellectual exercise is best when your passions, emotions and self-esteem are not at stake. Which is not the case with peer reviewers. As reviewers assign a score to your essay, they are in a position of power, just like teachers or bosses when they review your performance. Imagine how a discussion with your teacher or boss would turn out. At least you are faced with them day-to-day and you know them, but with virtual environments no one knows who other students are and their circumstances.;I think that it at least makes us wonder about the definition of Monster and the definition of Evil. In my opinion he was not 100% evil, but he was not totally good either.  Evil is at times defined by the person's actions, even if they start out with having good intentions. Victor was too ambitious and selfish and that's how his actions balanced more towards evilness than towards goodness. If you look at characters that have been defined as evil throughout all the stories you will find they are not always evil at the beginning, but their selfishness and ambition makes them go in that direction. At least at the end Victor was able to repent. But he was not able to love beyond his immediate circle and his motivations were still selfish. Even after admitting his guilt, he engaged in revenge with the monster instead of trying to forgive him. It never occurred to him to try to have more sympathy for the creature. He was a conflicted hero and it is a bit difficult to defend his actions, even though we may feel sorry for him.;Hola a todos,Ac   les dej _ un link para que se animen, pues es m  s dif _cil aprender espa  ol que ingl  s.Here's a link to cheer you up, as it is more difficult to learn spanish than english.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjDe4sLER0 Saludos.;A 2 is a pass only if you've received 2's in both Form and Content, which would be a Total Score of 4 for each essay. Note how it says that you have to calculate the average between Form and Content for each essay, not the sum of both components.;This has been discussed in several other threads and the conclusion is that a Total Score of 2 is a fail. OP, a score of 3.5 would still be a fail, it should be at least 3.6 or 4. Note how it says that you have to calculate the average between Form and Content for each essay, not the sum of both. Therefore, for each essay: Total Score = (Form+Content)Total score of 2 (1+1)= The average is of 1, so FailTotal score of 1 (1+0)= It is not possible since the lowest score for each component is 1Total score of 3 (1+2)= The average is of 1.5, thus it's still a FailTotal score of 3.5 (1.5+2)= The average is of 1.75, thus it's still a FailTotal score of 4 (2+2)= The average is of 2, so it's a PassHope it helps.;"

Martian Chronicles, I had no such luck. If you love books you might find a second-hand shop that you can volunteer at in return for reading them. If you are incredibly fortunate you're near a shop that lets you sit and read anyway.If those are all out of the question, I'm out of ideas for actually reading those books legally. I don't think it will turn out to be true that you can't participate for those two weeks. On the reading so far, I can see how people spend years on just Dracula or Grimm, for example. If you like the forums, I imagine there will be people still wanting to engage in discussions on your favourite books, in your unstructured weeks. And, you might by that stage find it great having three weeks to prepare a superawesome final essay on Doctorow.I imagine there will also emerge from the discussion boards and lectures, LOTS of other suggestions of things to read, which you might find free. You could post an essay on a different, related book on the discussion board, and someone is highly likely to give you feedback. You don't need permission. I see there's a ""More to Learn"" tab over on the left, too.If you're anything like me, one of the hard things in having a ""time-rich"" life, is structuring that time. It's an incredibly valuable skill to develop. Good luck.;This story has fresh poignancy for me as adult knowing of cases where children have been raised in captivity (including the recent Cleveland case). Somehow the ending, with the wandering in the desert, and the thorns and the blindness and the falling on his neck weeping, tears healing his eyes - this picture of grief and healing fits well.Locked in a room for twelve years, terrified at the sight of   a man.

This Christ-figure has no problem granting a woman's ambition to be King, Emperor and Pope, her obedient husband's anxieties notwithstanding. The fish finally rewards her ambition to be like God, by granting her a lowly Christ-like station back in the pigsty - ""And the first shall be last and the last shall be first"".;Hi all, I'm interested in what people think of Stoker's handling of The New Woman, and Mina's role, with her perfect blend of 'masculine brain' and 'feminine heart'. In other words, she's intelligent, compassionate and saves the day. A well-written hero *thumbs up*.;The answer is yes. You can pass the course with a minimum of six essays, if they are good enough.;Sublimation - it's a good thing. And Carroll put the sublime in sublimation.;I think the resistance to looking this with regard to Carroll - or should I say, Dodgson - is the huge importance of the story of that boat ride in which Wonderland was conceived (so to speak). In a way, that ""golden afternoon, full leisurely we glide"", *is* the story of Alice in Wonderland.Was Dodgson 'into' little girls? In a way, he invented little girls, and I suspect the lectures in this unit will look at how childhood itself is invented.And I'm not surprised few people want to mess with that.I think my new favourite concept, 'atavism' is at play here. We're surrounded now by talk of paedophilia, and media sexualisation of childhood, yet we are loathe to draw a line from those, back through Shirley Temple, to Dodgson, the ""lover of children"" at the dawn of photography.By the way, interesting euphemism, that - paedophile. Like it's some kind of sexual orientation. I prefer 'child molester' and 'child rapist' in cases where those apply.Dodgson was certainly an aesthetic lover of children (except boys). It's difficult to clear-headedly examine the connections (or not) between aestheticism, eroticism, sexualisation, objectification, and abuse. We know aestheticism can go horribly wrong - that doesn't mean it went terribly wrong in this case. It does sound like the parents of the children were right to be wary.;I guess I've added one problematic term to another by bringing in 'sexual orientation'!But on 'paedophilia', I don't know how it is where you are, but here in New Zealand we commonly hear the phrase 'convicted paedophile' in the news. The important distinction you have made has been lost, if it was ever there, in the 'public imagination' (if there is such a thing).   To that picture add frequent news of internet child pornograohy.All of these probably are more hindrances than help in understanding Dodgson/Carroll. ""Paedophile"" has become one of those conversational bombs like ""terrorist"" (I'd be interested to know which is used more frequently).Perhaps better talk of experiencing attraction to children. And, for better or for worse, if Dodgson had not been attracted to girls to a degree most would be uncomfortable with, he would not have created this character that has attracted millions of readers and collectors over nearly 150 years now.;"

I'd agree she doesn't fit a feminist mould, or any other kind of mould.I think the novel offers a different theory of how society changes. Mina expects society to change, but perhaps like Dracula she has a longer-term perspective. There's perhaps a hint that in a different time and place she might choose to marry someone other than Jonathan - but I think she truly does love Jonathan and wants to marry him (which some may find too convenient).While totally accepting the current state of society, she acts decisively to further the world's positive evolution. Yes, when necessary, but 'when necessary' is quite a good time to do things. She is the boss in those last few chapters, and is able to insist with quite some authority that Dracula be vanquished with love. Then she becomes a model for her son of what a woman can be, and so influences future society. I'm impressed by the way Mina differentiates herself from Jonathan - allowing a door to shut between them, ending the fused relationship the rather sappy Jonathan would have wanted. From a family sytems perspective, acts of differentiation like this can have a broader positive impact than ideological stances for or against marriage, childbirth and work.Yes, it's a little disappointing that Van Helsing seems to put Mina's heroics squarely in the past (actually he puts it more that she inspired heroics in others). It would be nice to see a sequel of Mina's further adventures, to see how Stoker imagined this family's life progressing. By the way, Stephanie, did you mean that your thesis was that the *character* of Dracula represented the New Woman in this novel? Now that would be interesting.;I appreciated the pattern interrupt. We both want to encourage a more nuanced understanding of this complex set of phenomena. There's a lot of interesting material on Wikipedia, and evidently a lot of work is being done on all aspects of this web of problems - including work on clarifying how the word 'paedophile' is used in law enforcement, which, I suppose, is the main influence on how the word is used in the media.I agree with Karen that we've done well to keep calm on this, it really is a minefield.Change of topic, but bear with me:The science section of the current Coursera course on Climate Change starts with an exercise: take one or more empty sheets of paper, set a timer for 15 minutes, draw a representation of everything you know about the Earth's climate system, and annotate it. Keep going for the whole 15 minutes, even if it seems to be a really long time. This will be a picture of your current mental model of the Earth's climate system.I thought, whoa! *now* I get what a mental model is, I'd heard about them for many years but had no clear idea of what they really were.And then they start the teaching.I say all this because a willingness to unpack mental models is really necessary if people are to engage in meaningful conversation on hot topics. I hope everyone gets to learn how to do that (perhaps starting with something easier than pedophilia!);Also not going to top Sean's answer, but back the truck up - it's interesting where our minds go with nonsense words.""vorpal sword"", uncapitalised.Could be:the sword was vorpal, vorpal being any kind of adjectiveor possiblythe sword was made of vorpal.If you capitalise it (as Carroll didn't), you're far more likely to give the impression that there is this iconic sword or kind of sword, The Vorpal.It really seems to have gone that direction in the role-playing-game world.wikipedia cites Martin Gardner saying Carroll once wrote: 'I am afraid I can't explain 'vorpal blade' for you   nor yet 'tulgey wood.'Now why don't we go the same direction with 'tulgey'? It's just a nonsense adjective (I get a kind of gloomy, eerie feel).And then I see online that people have turned it into The Tulgey Wood, a place in Wonderland! I would never have gone there (so to speak).I think someone could write a thesis on how late 20th-century/21st century culture takes literature and churns it in these ways.Anyway, more language play from Carroll.Speaking of where we go with nonsense words, I'd better link to the Bouba/Kiki effect:http://boingboing.net/2011/05/26/the-boubakiki-effect.html;Adding to all this - communication and communication technology seems to be a theme of the book. It all wouldn't work if Castle Dracula had had good mobile coverage. All the telegrams and things going around seem more than just great extensions to the epistolary format. There's Mina and Jonathan's shorthand thing, and Dracula intercepting it. Notice how time and space kind of warp to leave Lucy vulnerable, that slip in the address of the telegram which leaves a hole in modernity through which Dracula pounces.And then there's the 'communication' between Mina and Dracula.;  I've picked this up as a theme in Dracula:   the way it's really hard to hold on to the reality of experiences   that aren't part of our 'normal' worldview.The day after Seward sees irrefutable proof of vampiric activity, he manages to completely talk himself out of believing it. This is related to Van Helsing talking about how the modern rationalist won't believe in his own experience (and his whole occult scientist routine, which probably deserves another thread). Then at the very end, the group return to Transylvania and it's like nothing happened. And they had so meticulously assembled this epic-length tome of evidence only to find...oops, it turns out to be no evidence at all.Another thing which might be Stoker's writing or it might be me:  the first few chapters of Dracula have quite a singular mood, and I could really get into the whole Castle Dracula feel, and then whoa, when Jonathan realises he's being hypnotised - anyway, whoa.And then, while reading the back-in-London sections - it was very hard to *remember* in a way the feel of those seemingly unforgettable early chapters. Does anyone know what I mean?;Did Stoker coin this phrase? Brilliant line:""""If ever a face meant death - if looks could kill - we saw it at that moment.""Interestingly, searching for the phrase online yields pages about the evil eye,   I hadn't thought of the connection before.So at that moment the good guys see the reality behind the ancient notion that a look can kill - and at the same time, they don't die, looks can't kill. The superstition is real and not true at the same time.;Jonathan admits in the opening paragraph that he is scared to go too far from the station - I think he's also ""scared to go too far from the station"" intellectually or to make really original observation.Which reminds me of one of my favourite movies, 'The Squid and the Whale', which is also about the fear of opening up to experience beyond received notions.;"

(I'm told it's good etiquette to write 'Hmm.')To sum up:You're recruiting people to write propaganda.It doesn't sound so pretty, written short and accurate like that, does it?;Great, so long as we're clear. I regret my confrontational tone.;On a different note, John Michael Greer at thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com is a great writer who is a couple of months into a series on our tendency to dichotomously think of the future in either apocalyptic or triumphalist terms.We're in a world increasingly divided into those who expect, yes, oblivion or apocalypse, the latest version of which is Near Term Extinction - or those who expect business to go on as usual, bigger and brighter.It would be nice to think that wishing would make the latter so, but it's more plausible (to me) that we will see some degree of collapse, technically defined as rapid loss of complexity.Greer has edited ""After Oil: SF Visions of of a Post-Petroleum World"" , a collection of reader stories depicting human life in a...more plausible future.I haven't read it, but this idea is closer to what I expect from science fiction, exploring what *might* happen, rather than being propaganda for some vision of what *should* happen.I look forward to learning more about the connection between science fiction and futurism, later in the course.PS For those with the stomache for it, I highly recommend Dmiry Orlov's (non-fiction) The Five Stages of Collapse, to help start thinking more clearly about what might happen beyond simple 'oblivion' or 'technological triumph'. ;Stay tuned for the unit on Ursula LeGuin - she's one of Miyazaki's very favourite authors, and he apparently keeps the Earthsea books by his bedside. I found similarities between A Wizard of Earthsea and Ponyo. I wonder what we'll find in The Left Hand of Darkness.;Did you notice that Van Helsing's English became perfect when talking to Renfield?His facility with the language ebbs and flows all over the place.Why?I think it allows him to expand his range of expression.At one end, there are the two paragraphs starting ""Friend John"" in chapter 13. I got the impression when first reading - this is like the more esoteric parts of The Gospel of St John! Which would be consistent with Van Helsing's role as esoteric/occult scientist.And then at the other end, there's the great moment when Seward is saying if only he'd paid a bit more attention, maybe Lucy would not have become one of the undead, and they wouldn't have had to drive a stake through her heart and chop off her head. And Van Helsing comes out with a garbled version of ""Ah, well, it's no use crying over spilt milk"". I mean, WHAT??? Brilliant moment. I don't think a fluent English speaker could get away with that line. (and what's happening in the silence after he says it?)One aspect of modernity is the standardisation of language (and in ways our range of expression has narrowed considerably since Stoker was writing). Perhaps Stoker is commenting on what is being lost in that process.;One reason Victor is very hard to identify with is that he is riddled with toxic shame (and almost by definition, nobody wants to identify with shame).My evidence for this is the wonderful description of toxic shame in Chapter 9:""I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view"".When shame and terror run so deep as to disturb your sensory processing, as they do with Victor - well a lot of things are hard. You'd think he would have been able to, for example, save Justine by reporting that he saw a suspicious character near where William was killed - but he seems almost physically unable to, the way his senses and thought processes are hijacked by shame.That he comes across as an 'impostor' would also be consistent with this.I'm only on chapter 10, so I'll see how this thesis holds up in later chapters.Here's a link to Joseph Burgo who writes on shame, often using characters from literature as examples.http://www.afterpsychotherapy.com/the-invisible-client/;Phew, I can recommend identifying more with Victor if you can manage it. It makes for a terrifying novel.Okay, I'm going out on a limb.Spoilers below.It's part of Shelley's genius that we find it easier to sympathise with the creature. That's the way I read it when I was younger.Doing so requires us to ignore, firstly, that the creature too is a stupid, egotistic, self-pitying drama-queen, to a homicidal extent.It also requires overlooking the body count. Apologies in advance, I can't resist a parody here:""Sure he shows himself willing to murder in both hot and cold blood, sure he calculatingly frames a girl for murder because she's unlikely to sleep with him, and sure he bullies and threatens Victor, but underneath he's this sensitive guy, you know? Oh yeah, he psychologically terrorizes Victor, and goes out of his way to strangle Victor's best friend and wife - but oh, he's going through such angst as he does it!!! Poor soul - not like that whiny Victor, I don't know what his problem is...""I say stupid, not un-intelligent. Both Victor and the creature are highly intelligent. Victor is stupid only around 80%-90% of the time. Because he finally wrests himself from his stupidity, Victor is the hero, and the creature is not.In the world of the novel, it is Victor who gives us the main account of the creature, and he's eager to bring this sympathizable character (and his touching back-story) fully to life. Victor is also finally unashamed to document his own stupidity. Thus the way he comes across in the book is at odds with the impression he makes on Walton and the crew. If he hadn't been stupid then he wouldn't be able to offer this cautionary tale.And this is how people are, intelligent yet often stupid and short-sighted. That's why Frankenstein is an important novel.What's at the root of Victor's and the creature's stupidity? I can't just now find the key sentence, where Victor says something like, The whole time I was the monster's slave, I was impulsive and did the first thing that came into my head.The word ""slave"" here points to the key theme of Necessity and Freedom (roughly, free will vs. determinism) - that probably deserves another thread. Here I'll just say I think Necessity is the real monster.Victor is stupid when he is in the grip of Necessity - and he wrests himself free. The creature doesn't know he is in Necessity's grip, so he doesn't even try. He has no clue how diabolical is his ""reasoning"". Tragic.;Agreed!! That the shortsighted, single-minded pursuit of scientific discovery is kind of the point of Victor Frankenstein.;I agree, Anna, that this work does seem to encourage multiple theses!All have won, and all must have prizes!Okay if we're thinking 21st century paradigms - let's try 'mental illness'.Victor - obviously bipolar - I prefer to go back a few decades and call it shame-driven manic depression.The creature, I'm not qualified to diagnose, but if they managed to catch him, he'd be in a forensic psychiatric ward. Along with others with backgrounds which are highly sympathetic if you read about them and who are lovable when you're having a cup of tea with them - but the sympathy isn't always in the front of your mind when they're ""reasoning"" with you and screaming at you and attempting to bend you to their will and systematically exterminating your friends and family (okay that last bit I've never actually experienced, and to be fair I never experienced intimidation during my surprisingly pleasant visits to a forensic ward -   unfortunately I have experienced it out in 'normal society').Adding to that, look at this family system. You couldn't be more emotionally fused than these two. (at one point I had the creature as Victor's shadow, hence the revulsion that people are having trouble relating to).And Victor is supposed to be clearheaded enough to sort that out?Having had quite a bit to do with 'mental illness' in a variety of contexts, professional and personal - I really wish it were that easy. Victor does very well to start to get a bit of perspective up in Scotland, and then at the end let go of blame and control. Mental illness or not, it's all we can ever do.;Here's a website exploring Vampire fiction and Tibetan Buddhism.http://buddhism-for-vampires.com/I like it, and I thought it might provide an interesting point of contrast.;I thought the De Laceys got servants because Safie brought money with her?;The creature had me     until I saw     ""the sun setting     behind the stupendous mountains of Jura"".          To continue my prosecution:          The creature screams his 'reason', bends Victor to his     will, and systematically exterminates his kin. All the while he     blames Victor, denies applying pressure (""..instead of threatening,     I am content to reason with you"")....and plays the Victim card! My     creator made me do it. My parent's neglect made me do it. My     attachment disorder made me do it. Society made me do it. And most     explicitly, the foundation of his argument, ""I am malicious because     I am miserable"" - Misery made me do it.          And he wins over the jury of public opinion (the readers)!!!!! -     everyone loves the monster, right? - all based on Victor's     testimony (a parallel to Justine's fate ironically being sealed by     Elizabeth's evidence?)          Oh, the mind games!!!          Folks, this creature has been playing us for nearly two centuries     now.          He reminds me of another intelligent, eloquent guy - the     Unabomber: 'Technological determinism made me do it'          The 'reasons' are all versions of 'Necessity made me do it'.     Deterministic arguments, causal arguments, arguments denying free     will.          Meanwhile, there are plenty of violent offenders in the world. All     of them could persuasively and validly call on at least one     of the arguments given above, (given a ghostwriter as sympathetic as     Victor).          The creature isn't a monster. He's human. I get it. Every monster     is.          So, what do we do? Whither justice?          Meanwhile, scientists, often as blinker-visioned (read     'hyperspecialised') as Victor and Walton, are off Discovering more     causes of causes, preferably the causes whose manipulation suits     their sociopathically violent corporate funders and the politically     immune criminal banksters (hehe, sorry, got a bit of a roll on     there. Don't worry, they have good ghostwriters/lawyers).     As in the novel, ""society"" is, corporately, stupid and criminal.          So, what do we do? Whither justice?          Victor, not yet quite out of Necessity's grip, tries to convince     the crew to that they 'must' pursue their suicidal mission of     Discovery across the Arctic. It's a testament to his cautionary tale     that they are free to ignore him.          Meanwhile, thanks to humanity's unwitting technological choices, we     now make that voyage across the Arctic quite comfortably.

Presumably the reverse was true 200 years ago?;""until the end of his life"", exactly. Here's another point where Victor is redeemed, only at the very, very end.When Victor is finally able to open himself to love, he finds himself in the company of the spirits of the departed.In contrast, the creature at the end admires and potentially loves Victor - but to him Victor is merely dead.Only a pure product of mechanized science could think themselves absolutely alone in the universe. (especially with Walton right next to him ;)     );Mar, I hadn't heard of Godwin - your take sounds intriguing. Shelley's literary world continues to blow my mind! I've just been introduced to Kropotkin via Dmitry Orlov's The Five Stages of Collapse, which you might like (by the way the banking suggestion doesn't sound naive at all) - fascinating to think Frankenstein has something to do with the roots of modern anarchism.Emma, I think the 'child' take has some validity. Certainly he has the emotional intelligence of a six-month-old. Do we exculpate the creature because he's a child, or see him as a child because we want to exculpate him?On 'things that force our hand', see below.Anonymous, join the club. After a bit of self-compassion for the child I was, I'm in less of a prosecutory mood today - interesting - thanks.--------I was probably too busy being cute to do justice to the theme of 'necessity'. I think it's a word worth tracking, along with with others to do with freewill and determinism (the scene where Victor rejects the idea of a bride for the creature is the only one where 'voluntary' enters his vocabulary).Editor Peter Fairclough has the folllowing as a note to Victor's mention of man's 'superior' faculties making them 'only more necessary beings' than the brute animals (Chapter 10):""William Godwin's pet theory was that the Principle of Necessity, which denies free will to man, rules the world.[and this was made fun of by some author called Peacock]""Well, look at that, I had heard of Godwin, but missed the connection. Fairclough's note led me to say elsewhere: Necessity, not the creature, is the real monster.;The ""how"" is that he read Albert Magnus and other such ""Occult"" books.;Okay, granted. I'll try to be more precise. Here's my take:The ""how"" is that he dabbled in magic.Magic transforms one's consciousness.Victor thinks his attempts at self-initiation have had no effect. He has unconsciously transformed his own consciousness.Victor is the narrator. He's unconscious of the ""how"". That's why it's not 'narratively robust'. As Professor Rabkin hints, he's not an entirely reliable narrator.;Again this is where, unlike the creature, Vincent finally realises there is such a  thing as free will - i.e. the female might have something to say about it.The creature idealised a small child - then destroyed it once it deviated from his ideal.He put to death a girl who was unlikely to sleep with him.What would he do to a woman who said ""no""?;Hi Jeremy, I went and sought out the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and there are huge connections throughout. A Wizard of Earthsea is also the book I thought of after reading Frankenstein. ;I sought out some of Percy Bysshe Shelley's work. It's really hard!As we're reading 'A Modern Prometheus', this from Mr Shelley's Preface to his Prometheus Unbound, seems relevant. He's talking about Milton's Paradise Lost:""The character of Satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs, and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure. In the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse.""The second sentence is relevant because in Frankenstein, the creature reads Paradise Lost and takes it as gospel.The first, because we tend automatically to weigh the creature's wrongdoing with his sympathetic background (and compare it to Victor's shortcomings multiplied by his privileged background?).The editor of my copy of Mr Shelley's Selected Poetry, Harold Bloom, says that 'a pernicious casuistry' is ""a phrase crucial to the understanding of Shelley's criticism of Paradise Lost, since it applies to the supposedly Satanist reading of the poem."" It's probably also crucial to understanding Frankenstein, as judgement is a prevalent theme in the novel, given all the court hearings.'Marlow' singles out Paradise Lost in the prefacethe creature is written so that we have 'sympathy for the devil'Darn Mary Shelley, the more I read, the more references I need to follow up!;I think it's important that the creature intimidates Victor intellectually as well as physically - Victor's caution to Walton is against the creature's ""eloquence and persuasion"".  From the vantage-point of the 1817 preface, it's important that the creature experience the ""enervating effects of the novels of the present day"", particularly that he takes Paradise Lost so to heart [cue self-promotion: I've written about that in this thread on The other Shelley, Paradise Lost, and sympathy v. judgement again ]I think it's important that, like Victor and Walton, he has studied too much alone, outside of relationship. He comes to think he is the only one who can rise above people's tendency to be 'necessary beings' pushed into stupidity by their words and other mental constructs, he thinks he alone can just get on with people without prejudice. He then straightaway kills William because of a word: ""Frankenstein"".And I think it's important that Shelley wrote a creature that has gripped our culture's imagination even without any of this!!;There's a lot about Elizabeth and Victor's Dad suspecting he was having an affair. Perhaps he was married to his work and to the creature.;Doesn't the father ask at some stage if the sister-like thing is putting Victor off marriage?By the way, there apparently is a biological mechanism that turns us off the prospect of having sex with someone we were raised with very early in life (it's been a source of rebellion in countries with very young arranged marriages) - I can't remember the cut-out point, but Victor and Elizabeth seem above that age.;This interpretation would fit with comparison to The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, where all kinds of spiritual beings come to the mariner's aid, and the crew see things as well. The whole thing might have happened to avert the shipwreck, the only way it could get through Walton's head (Walton had read The Ancient Mariner but seems to have got no moral beyond 'I hope I don't come back disappointed'). This all had to be *real* to Walton, not just a ghost story.;I was going to write about this in a different thread and call it ""asocial learning today"", but it seems to fit here.To what extent are we, like Victor and Walton, 'delaying affection' by pursuing our interests online, in gamified environments like Coursera (I was creeped out when I got to a page that said, ""Loading reputations..."").Lee Siegel, in an excellent little book called ""Against the Machine"", in 2008 argued that all internet experience tends to become the same, as trading sites, dating sites, networking sites all have the same logic. Internet interaction tends to bring out the worst kind of teenager in us, the popularity-chaser, subtly shaping our performance of self to win the upvotes of strangers. At the end of the book, he gives a poignant description of how, in the final analysis, the logic of the asocial/social online environment all encourages the same lonely, objectifying mindset as pornography.The above picture is from an article (not by Siegel, who doesn't write from a religious perspective) called ""The Conspiracy of Pornography Exposed"", which comes to similar conclusions:""The isolation which networking ironically breeds is a harbinger of a new  narcissism. Self-centeredness seeks seclusion and the license to  exercise control, as do those absorbed with online-selves, surfing a  virtual world of avatars. These pursuits are addictive and buried in  ego-stroking falsehoods designed to affect a stimulating pleasure   a  pleasure isolated from reality. The eventuality is a hunger that gorges  on what can never satisfy. There can be no fulfillment, no consummation.  It is perverse. It is pornographic. In other words, pornography is not  necessarily restricted to    adult    films,    men   s    magazines, and forty  percent of the worldwide web."";"

They both failed to find a partner or a worthwhile occupation or a place in London society, and they drift into science out of boredom. They both use science to deny the possibility of attaining Manhood - so they don't have to take responsibility for their failure. (I love the quote from Prendick: ""Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take all the manhood from a man"").Prendick is for a while galvanised to struggle - but is there an object of desire so that we can call it an Oedipal comedy or tragedy? He seems to end up back as before his journey started, alone in his study, reading.Any thoughts?;Thanks for the responses...in any case trying to see how the Oedipal structure works has helped me find more of interest in the novel than on the first rush through.There's plenty that's suggestive of Oedipal themes, even if it's not all there.Where are the women?   There seems to be plenty of fear of women and sexuality, the way Prendick couldn't possibly describe the ""evidently female"" beast/people and their sexual behaviour. When he is galvanised to act, he is trying to save his soul, the soul being kind of feminine. He has a nephew, so I imagine he has a sister.Perhaps the biggest clue is that in the first paragraph of chapter one he rattles off three female names of boats (meanwhile he doesn't know the name of a man he spent a week with in a lifeboat!!! Who or what is worth naming?).The chapter titles tell a story of their own... from ""In the Dingy of the 'Lady Vain'"" to ""The Man Alone"".Perhaps boats, representing escape from London and society, are the illicit object of desire....Oedipal tragedy.;Interesting point about the food, Maria, food seems to be a turning point for Nunez in The Country of the Blind as well. I notice that servant is eventually dignified with a name,;You're probably right, David.I've just read The Country of the Blind, and they're close to being the same story.Protagonist of the 'entitled' classes,is humbled, gets a more realistic view of the world and his dependence on others,and despite alienation from blinkered society,develops capacity for awe.I'm pretty sure The Country of the Blind is an Oedipal romance (Nunez, unlike Oedipus, keeps his eyes).So Prendick's story probably is too. Prendick acts to save his soul, not just his skin, in chapter 11 (human souls are mentioned in book's last paragraph as well). That's likely the licit object of desire.He ends up letting go of the earlier, 'compensatory' boats.Reading it this way depends on seeing Prendick as keeping his humanity through the last section of the book. I don't know. He got it when he   wanted to confront Moreau face to face.I thought he lost it again when, for example, he became inured to the sound of the crying puma. But perhaps that's a more human response to an extreme situation (and he knows it's wrong), compared to his earlier 'I-can-live-with-it-as-long-as-I-don't-have-to-hear-it' stance.Still, I didn't admire Prendick the way I ended up admiring Nunez. He never learned to love people (outside of books), and he still seems misanthropic. But maybe he 'grew up' on an 'island' more devoid of humanity than Nunez did.;I thought of the blindness in analogy to the blindness of those of us who believe only in the five senses (although I think some have counted up to twelve or more), and how we respond to those who have a higher spiritual or creative vision, or other sensibilities.A real life illustration - one of New Zealand's greatest writers, Janet Frame, was nearly given a frontal lobotomy. Luckily the doctors got news she had just won a literary award, just in time. (Her story is told in the movie An Angel at my Table).Megan, re:""So to me, the scene where they decide to remove Nunez's eyes had a  special resonance, because the disabled community as a whole still does  suffer from this idea that only when we all have exactly the same  disability can we work together for equality! This attitude is exactly  why the disability rights movement in my country (USA) has stalled.""Without wanting to deny the resonance for you - you've drawn an analogy that I'd mark down if I saw it in an essay, not because it relates to the present but because it doesn't relate to the story. The people of the country of the blind neither function as a disability community nor identify as disabled. They function as the dominant society.They're not bringing down a high achiever. They're dealing with a mental health case.On the other hand, I'm sure the resonance you mention is not irrelevant.... I think you can build a stronger thesis about how that resonance works, without reference to identity politics which I think is something of a 'blind alley' with regard to this story.Hehe, I get the feeling I'm wrong, but I look forward to your essay proving it to me :);I read this as a bit of anarchistic thinking. It's not bare religion that's being made fun of, but religion that conveniently supports the ""state's"" monopoly on violence.;Oh, one-eyed King, possibly phallic, I hadn't thought of that.I think 'rape' is a subset of 'exploitative behaviour', and Nunez's attitude is exploitative at the beginning.His path out of that towards full humanity, is pretty much developmentally ideal.Starts to see people as individuals, not members of classes.In the beginning just finds women hot, but his desire eventually leads him to actually love someone.Romantic bubble burst, he generalises his capacity to love, and develops a sense of awe.So my answer to your question about which world we live in: some people make it well along that developmental path, others don't.;Oh, and:Perhaps Nunez shifts in his interpretation of ""the One-eyed man is King""At first he thinks, oh, my sight is my advantage over these people.But in the endonce he gives up being ""King""......he can afford to open both eyes!;"

Eating a nut isn't enough to deserve death, (We've all snuck an extra cookie sometime, haven't we?) but to starving medieval peasants, eating more than your share and depriving others of their food would seem like a pretty bad thing to do. I'd also like to add that the story also deals with the horrors of living in an untrustworthy community.  The other creatures basically let the cock's wife die, but the cock  still has to rely on them to help him bury her. Even if the burial had  gone completely smoothly, the trauma of relying on people who let his  wife choke to death would've been really humiliating for him.Remember that medieval villages were really isolated. Because of heavy forests and lack of roads or law enforcement, travel was really dangerous. A village 15 miles away could have a completely different dialect from yours so you wouldn't completely understand what they were saying. Villagers were basically stuck in the community they were born in, even if the community was horrible, like the cock's, so a story like ""Death of the Hen"" would've rung true to them. So while I don't think ""Death of the Hen"" has a moral in the Aesop fable sense, it has experiences that reflect the dark-age culture it came from.;How would you compare the fairy tales the Grimm brothers compiled to the fairy tales Hans Christian Anderson wrote? They're obviously from different national backgrounds (the Grimm brothers were German, Anderson was Danish). Anderson's most famous stories (Snow Queen, Little Mermaid, Match Girl) were originally written by him, while the Grimm Brothers mainly compiled stories from foreign countries and feudal history. I personally feel that the Grimm tales are more focused on power struggles and survival, while the Anderson tales are more focused on personal loneliness.  The Grimm tales are filled with cannibalistic witches, contests of strength, and abandoned orphans trying not to starve. Since these stories were told and passed down from the dark ages through famines, wars, and unstable governments, it makes sense they'd focus on protagonists trying to fight nature and build good lives for themselves.  The Anderson tales, on the other hand, seem to be more about the pain of trying to ""reach"" other people, like the Steadfast Soldier pining after the ballerina, or the sister in the ""Snow Queen"" who tries to save her brother after he loses the ability to perceive beauty. Sometimes the protagonist's loneliness is even attached to a surivival element, like the Little Mermaid who'll never go to heaven unless a human falls in love with her. Anderson's original tales were written in the 19th-century, when day-to-day surivival was easier and Europe was exploring Romantic ideas, so it makes sense his stories would be more about connecting with people in the society around you. Basically, I think the Grimm tales are more about surviving literal death. while the Anderson tales suggest that not being able to connect with others is like a kind of death itself. What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I hope we can have more in-depth discussions in these forums, so I want to spark a conversation! :) ;Thank you, Melissa. I did mention that the Grimm's tales were compiled from tales ""told and passed down through the dark ages,"" but I feel like I could've put more emphasis are their collective, oral nature in my post. Thanks for pointing that out. That being said, I do feel that Andersen's tales are about more than just his own experiences. They might have stemmed from his personal loneliness and love lives, but for them to have become as popular as they did, something about them must have captured the minds of 19th-century European society as a whole. Consider the boy in the ""Snow Queen"": When the Snow Queen brainwashes the boy and spirits him away, he's only able to think of the world in numbers and equations. It reflects the common Romantic-era sentiment of math and science ""corrupting"" the pure. Andersen might have had a more personal hand in his tales than the Grimm's (and some of his tales were still passed down/influenced by nurses and tutors), but I think in the end they too ""widely reflect the concerns of a whole culture,"" just like the Grimm's.;"

I'm sorry I can't post it now because I'm abroad and the hotel computer is limited, to say the least. I think it all makes sense if you treat the tale as a dream. I'll post my essay next week.;Hello ! I've managed to copy my interpretation of ""The Death of the Hen"" here it isAll Grimm stories, however fanciful, follow a clear logic, except one which seems quite nonsensical :    The Death of the Hen   . We might be tempted to dismiss it as meaningless, unless we understand it as the representation of a dream.             The story starts with the cause of the choking of the hen, her greed which makes her break her promise to share the nut with the cock. However, the moral of the story is not, as in most tales, made explicit. One does not draw conclusions in dreams...             The second scene is the quest for water by the cock, in a vain attempt to save the hen. It is centered on a bride, who has to provide him with scarlet silk, which could be the proof of her virginity before marriage, in exchange for her lost garland, which may refer to her being unfaithful. The    unfaithfulness    of the hen is developed here. We can also observe that the cock's quest is frantic : there is a strong sense of urgency which is constantly impeded, until the cock succeeds in getting water, but too late. The feeling of being obstructed in one's movement is a very common feature of   dreams.             The last scene is the hen's funeral. All the animals attend the funeral, and all die while trying to cross the river, without any explanation concerning their death. Even a burning piece of coal, symbol of the warmth of life, is extinguished. No one can pass that river but the cock, whose love for the hen allows him to overcome all obstacles, until he dies of grief, his faithfulness contrasting the hen's betrayal.             Stretching the interpretation of the story further, we may think of it as the dream of a man whose wife is unfaithful. He unconsciously wants her dead, while knowing that her death would be the end of his world, and the end of himself;"

Or like in the Frog prince, you think she's going to end up kind to him, and that would be what breaks the spell(isn't that how all the re-tells explain the story?

Nothing at all to say how she fell in love with him, or any of that...no, instead it ends with someone thrown in randomly, who cared about him long ago UN-breaking his chained heart. Um, WHAT? SURE, I could come up with explanations that are just as out of the blue as random characters thrown in, but if the stories are read at just face value, it could be confusing to say the least.

My mom would just smile and refuse to read it to me and   tell me to read it myself. It really helped because, I liked the pictures so much, I would push myself to understand the text just to know what it said.   :);Disclaimer: I'm sorry, I didn't read all the responses, so bear with me if I am being repetitive.I don't think it is possible for anything to be completely pointless. Narrative can be viewed broadly in two ways - What the writers probably meant, and the reader's interpretation.From a brief background read-up on the Grimm Fairytales, I understood that the stories were meant to aid the efforts of Romanticism and build a national identity for Germany by representing German culture and folklore in a way that was accessible to everyone, including children. From this, we can assume allusions to German culture - such as the use of cabbage in The Rabbit's Bride (just an example- cabbage is an important ingredient in German cuisine, and stealing that made the rabbit a symbol of the forces that were directly or indirectly attacking a significant part of the local culture)- however random it may seem.As for the subjective perspective, I think we are all free to interpret the stories the way we want to, which opens up a lot of opportunity for creativity. In Death of a Hen, for instance, you could derive the moral that one small selfish act(not sharing   nut) could have more far reaching effects than one can imagine (everyone ends up dying).;I don't think the readings should make us uncomfortable if we are, within ourselves, and with each other, honest about the fact that all of this is just an objective study of subjective literature. Racism, sexism and discrimination are all just part of the narrative. We don't personally attach ourselves to any of those things while studying the works, so don't worry about it too much :);Of course! It would kill literature to treat it entirely objectively, but a degree of detachment could help is deal with the discomfort, I suppose :)  ;When I was a kid, I read Walt Disney's version of the fairytales before I read the Grimm's version. And the difference is striking.  I remember being more drawn to the happy endings and pretty illustrations in Disney books, and more averse to the revenge and darkness and eerie illustrations in Grimms' books.  For a child reader, and especially on like me, for whom English is a second language, fairytales were something you use to entertain yourself with and learn language from. So, happy stories were perfectly fine.  But as we grow older, and see more evil in the world, I think we become paranoid and cautious and begin to think that exposure to dark things better equips you to face the big bad evil world. This is why people like  Bettelheim and the Grimms find it necessary to reflect on and symbolically represent the negative side of reality in children's literature.I personally, however, don't think it necessary to introduce the dark element to children, because doing that never helped me deal with my fears. In fact, I think a lot of my fears as a child were born from the creepy imagery put in my mind by the idea of evil witches and revenge and torture.  ;I agree! :) For me as a child, Grimm's tales were just evil and unpleasant. But now, I understand that I should respect narrative for what it is. I have no idea where these things come from, but when I learn, it will be gratifying.  ;"

Bearing in mind the Grimm brothers didn't write their own stories but transcribed them from the oral tradition that still existed, many of the stories in the collection aren't very good, but what the one's that survive into the canon do have charm. This one isn't very good and doesn't have much charm. They have a utility, that of entertaining children, the method being the anamorphic devices that so appeal to the infant imagination. Bruno Bettleheim will give you all the psychological analysis you want, but I think the truth of the matter is that its stuff adults made up when they had to entertain kids. The use of animals as a hack technique is to engage the imagination. It's a technique of entertainment, as in 'holding the attention', not because there is any inherent deeper meaning or symbolism; other that what the reader derives. It is a thing of wonder. In the spirit of which, it seems to say, 'conform', 'do not indulge in relationships outside of your type (class)'. It didn't stop the rabbit, who probably needed some comfort cabbage asap.

However, the feeling I get from the story is that it's really about the maiden. The mother and the rabbit are both figures in relation to her.  First she is told what to do by her mother, to send him away. He shows sexual interest in her ""ride on my tail..."", and she refuses the first couple times, because her mother is warning against it. But the third time she gives in and goes with him. The cabbage patch represents her fertility and her innocence, and living in a house with her mother represents being isolated and innocent. He comes to take away her innocence, and her mother warns her to send him away. When she doesn't heed her mother, and is seduced by him, he immediately begins bossing her around, and tells her to cook the cabbage for their guests, which seems a bit like exploitation and putting her on display. She feels lonely and realizes that she shouldn't have given in to the sexual temptation because this rabbit isn't that nice of a guy. She realizes her mistake, and returns home to her mother where she will be protected.  I think it is about rebellion and growing up, as well. She doesn't WANT to be isolated and obedient to her mother forever. She just finds out nearly too late that she will just end up being a slave to the rabbit instead.  ;I don't think she left for no reason, or just because she's gullible and non-assertive. When you read the story, everything she does in the entire first part is based on doing her mother's bidding. This rabbit gives her an opportunity to rebel from her mother and leave home. Perhaps she is curious what he can offer her that her mother can't.   I think Abigail is onto something.But she traded one sort of submissiveness for another. She went from being an obedient daughter to becoming an obedient bride, and she realized that leaving wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  ;Leslie, I think the ""sit on my tail"" DEFINITELY has sexual connotation. The way I read it, was that rather than having no choice but to go with him because he deflowered her, is that he basically led her into sexual temptation; he seduced her. The first two times she said no, but the third time she gave in. She went with him, was ""deflowered"" but did not want to be trapped into the marriage. She had made a mistake.  I thought it was interesting that there was no father figure as well.

As for his grammatical constructions, they seem a bit strange for either German or Dutch, and I couldn't help but feel he was faking his foreignness. Not sure to what end, though.

In this light Christianity and science are in fact mutually reinforcing, rather then contradicting. ;"

Though it seems to me that the poor moral character of the one who desires everything at the expense of the other is what cripples either the morally deficient individual, the individual being used or in this case both!The story before this:  Clever Grethel, shows her justifying her greediness and happily ruining the relationship between the master and his guest by lying to cover her tracks.Notice, also, that Grethel wears 'shoes with red heels' and the brook requests 'red silk', the rabbit's bride used . I've thought about this emphasis on red in these stories regarding greediness and gluttony, their effects crippling relationships and causing tragedy, and am struggling to see why it is significant.  In any case, the stories up to this, The Death of the Hen,  have been, in my opinion, centred around greed and wealth. The greedy causing tragedy (The Death of the Hen), tarnishing relations  (Clever Grethel), being usurped (Six Soldiers of Fortune) and forcing marriage under violence (The Rabbit's Bride). They each show figures of authority - a cock, a king, a master, a bridegroom - and agreements which are undermined - sharing food, cooking food for guests, giving a fair pay, suitable marriage (not necessarily agreed upon, but believed to be so by the rabbit) - and I believe it is a message to authorities. The message is thus: Those who act in a way unjust meet their end soon enough or ruin everything they held dear. The people do not stand for usurpers and will find ways to rebel, like the six soldiers or the rabbit's bride.

Although, this didn't particularly turn out too well for him in the end.Although the hen was originally at fault for breaking the deal and deceiving the cock, perhaps he believed that this was no reason for her to die, so he set out on a quest to retreive water for her. He did everything he was asked of, without question, so that he could brink water for the hen and save her.  The latter part of the story reminds me of a song from the Wicked soundtrack: ""No Good Deed Goes Unpunished"". This is because the straw and the coal offered to help, but eventually doomed themselves, and the animals they were trying to help. Only the stone was effective in getting them across, so maybe this is a lesson in that one must have a strong base in order to get through tough times.  My take on the story is that the cock is a devoted man, whereas the hen is a dishonest woman. Their relationship falls apart because the woman cheats the man, and everyone dies (but maybe the fact everyone died a sad death is an exaggeration on being loyal to someone who is not loyal to you).Or I could be speaking gibberish.

BLERGH! On the bright side, that gives me an opportunity to post my thoughts here, and I'm not limited to a measly 320 words. On the other hand, I've already watched the post-reading lectures, and have therefore taken on the ""taint"" (using the term loosely) of the professor's   analysis.Professor Rabkin has certainly made many very astute observations and has, with the help of established research, provided us with a thorough analysis of the works of the Grimm Bros as a whole and in detail. He has provided us with the Male, Modern, Urban, Christian, Western view of this collection, or rather, compilation and subsequent re-write of these tales.I come at this from the viewpoint of Female, Anachronistic, Pagan, and neither western nor eastern, perhaps a more Indigenous (in the sense of ""connected to the older ways, or to nature"") way of looking at things.Taking into full account the aspects pointed out by Professor Rabkin, i.e. the underlying nationalistic agenda, the rampant sexism and intentional archetypal programming of gender roles, societal behaviors, religious views and prejudices, I'd like to call your attention to a couple of other things I've noticed or have had pointed out to me over the years by friends and mentors.As much as bread and wine are the nourishment of the Christian sacrament, milk,   honey, grain and meat are the proper foods for the Gods for many northern European and Celtic Pantheons. These Pantheons include strange beings, often referred to as ""Faerie"" or ""Elves"" ""Albs"" (btw, an alternative etymology of Albion, or the names Alban/Albert and similar, is Alfar, or Elf, ""Albion"", therefore, could also be construed as the land of the Elves).   While, to most of us, in the context of the modern world, such beings, be they demi gods, nature spirits or denizens of a frightful night, will seem unreal, and one's insistence on their existence will meet with anything from friendly ridicule to accusations of insanity, at the time the stories were published in their written formDISbelief in these beings was just as much considered an insanity.Now, these tales were laid down at a time when, despite the efforts of the Inquisition, a couple of centuries before, some people still remembered, taught and studied these older forms of knowledge. At a time when there wasn't a central, proscribed and conveniently censored curriculum for the majority of young students, these tales provided yet one more way to discredit the old ways, by portraying the wise crones as evil witches, the young and pretty airheads as the winners, often by defying or overcoming their ill portrayed elders. Cleverly, the writers left just enough small bits of the old knowledge in these stories to make them seem credible; i.e. who, at that time, DIDN't know that woman's moon blood is one of the most powerful magic substances a human could get her hands on? While making most traditional magic the tools of the opponent and therefore programming society into thinking that the tools themselves were evil, the Grimms furthered the cause of the Christian faith to disregard and revile views and beliefs that went against their patriarchial agenda. Incidentally, generations upon generations of women were programmed into domestic docility, rejection of their bodies, intuitions and innate skills, often at the cost of our, admittedly different, but sharp intellect. At the same time, men were programmed into thinking of women as inferior, therefore not worth listening to in all matters of advice, or as readily exploitable, since women were ""worth less"". Maidens (daughters) were programmed into disregarding the wisdom and advice of their elders, those barren witches (oh, yea, while you're at it, look up the etymology of ""witch"", and, if you think I;m WEIRD,... do yourself a favor,... look that word up too :-) )Now we are left with a MESS. Several generations of alienating ourselves not only from nature, due to the loss of society's knowledge of every natural life and thing as a fellow being, but also several generations worth of deeply subconsciously ingrained behavioral patterns that are counter to natural balance but are presented to us from day one,.. gender oriented clothing, the difference in toys, books or acceptable activities, etc etc. The disregard of one gender for another and vice versa, the outright prejudice against other cultures or deviants within our own are well established behavioral patterns due to our early programming, when the pathways in the brain are still malleable.   We have, to a large extent exported this buggy program   to other cultures accross the globe. The Brothers Grimm have done a marvelous job, Now, how do we undo it? Responsibly? Without putting something similarly faulty in its place?;"

It's a common theme in fairytales, especially the early ones, and in this story I think it opens up another possible moral: not just working together to better society, but working together to subvert the established power.;I think all of these are interesting possible explanations, and personally, I like the numerological background - the number three has always been important, far pre-dating Christianity, and trinities have been a vital part of divinity and spirituality for thousands of years. Maybe the threes are not just to help us remember and interact, but to warn people early on that something important was coming? Before we recognized the pattern and integrated it into our schema.  ;It's definitely one potential moral. In this case, though, I think it was more meant to be an amusing bit of feminist subversion - Grethel is very clever and the men she deals with are easily duped morons. Even more telling, Grethel isn't just the clever ""winner"" in this story, she also sets all the men against each other. Of course, there's a bit of critical male perspective in this adaptation for the fact you pointed out - Grethel is the female representative and she's a selfish, manipulative liar.;I think you're both right - fairy tales are always in some way about morality, but it doesn't have to be an obvious or even a firm stance about what's right and wrong. I think this story, like the others, is meant to be open for interpretation. Like Alan said, this was a very strictly controlled and religious time, these stories are meant to be subversive, quiet rebellion against the social order, not an affirmation of its opinions.;John, that is one definition of a fairytale, but it's a narrow one.

He feels pity for the miller's daughter. He says about himself: ""I would rather have something living than all the treasures of the world"". At that point he is in total contrast to the king, who is simply interested in gold.  The first time, the king sees all the gold, he is astonished: So he never thought it being possible to the miller's daughter spinning gold out of straw. This may implicate two meanings: Either he does not care at all about a human life or he plays a quite cruel play to the miller's daughter in threatening her with death, maybe to force her to admit the truth: that she is not capable of spinning gold out of straw.Rumpelstiltskin gets the necklace and the ring. Maybe he takes a burden from the miller's daughter(?):The necklace may stand for being chained to someone or something, the ring as a visible sign of being engaged. He allows her extra time to think of his name. Does he act so because he underestimates the miller's daughter's ability? (like the king never thought of her spinning ability?) Why does he not fear the possibility, that she may tell the king? He puts himself into danger at that point. Does he know that the miller's daughter and meanwhile Queen will not tell her husband the truth? That she will more likely risk to lose her child?The Miller's daughter does not try to defend herself in front of the king. Why does she not speak for herself and tell the truth? Why does she think: ""But who knows whether that will happen?""   Does she not take for serious her situation?   Rumpelstiltskin at last cries: ""The devil told you that!"" How may we understand this? The devil is the only one, who knows Rumpelstiltskin's name? Or that, like Faust, she does not hesitate to beg the devil's support? (Do you know the Lilith-Myth in the Talmud? Lilith was Adam's first wife. She was equal to him and not willing to get into submission. She knew God's secret name. When God in Adam's demand tries to force her to be submissive to Adam   and him, she cries out loud his name and therefore gets banned from paradise into desert.) So in the Christian-Jewish tradition there is a secret around God's name. In the end the Miller's daughter becomes a very powerful Queen. She ascends socially and her child stays with her!   Hope you find my thoughts on Rumpelstiltskin interesting!;It's really fine, that you liked my comment.I watched somewhat closely to the brewing and baking thing. In a German encyclopedia   ""Bier-Lexikon"" I found an article about the brewing origin (title: Einst war das Brauen Frauensache - which means: There was a time when Brewing was a femals business). Very famous was the Holy Hildegard of Bingen for her universal knowledge and one of her skills was the knowledge about beer brewery. But you may go back in history even to the old Germanic People: in these times the women brewed the beer.Going back to the Brothers Grimm: they were part of the Romanticism movement in Germany at that time. They wanted to create a new intellectual world, referring to their german origins. The Romanticists were idealistic, highly sensitive intellectuals, poetrists, philosophers, scientists, artists and musiciens of all kinds. They came together in so called ""Literarische Salons / Jour fixe"", which, by the way quite often were arranged by sophisticated young women like Rahel Levin Varnhagen, Henriette Herzberg or Dorothea Schlegel   discussing their philosophical, aesthetical or social ideas.In these movement quite a lot of famous women became writers (Caroline von G _nderode, Madame de Stael [who was a french artist], Bettina von Arnim). Here   a new intellectual world opened its windows to women and men. This was quite new!;I read your post and felt really touched . I had a time, when I was not able to read any kind of literature without detecting racists, mysogyne or else discriminating implications. I gave up reading for a while.  Than I started to search for those hidden traces of female or else subversive, fragmented culture or discourse. What I think is really important is to find reflections on your own feelings, abilities, desires, confessions or maybe prejudices?! This is, what reading and reflection on myths and motives in literature really means to me.During the last summer I read some of John Irvings novels. I don't know, whether or not Irving is a persona non grata in the American literature scene, but I really liked his openmindedness to personal concepts. I found, which is really quite rare among male writers, that he loves his female protagonists, he loves all kind of bodies, especially the imperfect ones. The most intact, sane persons in his novels are those, who are female and male attributed characters, the closer to 100 %female or male they come, the more rude or stupid or simply disgusting are theyThink of that and be at ease with yourself. You are who you are. We are all in different ways disabled, imperfect, not mainstream, not fitting in those aesthetic, social or gender common places. Maybe a great deal of writers felt that way to -which lead to their writing and our reflections on it!;Dear Megan,Owen Meany is own of my all-time-favorite novels. I totally agree with you.

Thank you for your insights.Andrea;Megan,Thank you for your short ""book review"": I will keep it in mind, since it sounds/reads really interesting!;It's not necessesarily obedience and/or beauty which leads to the ""happy end""! Look at the princess in  ""Frog Prince"": she breaks the curse in being disobedient and rejecting the inappropriate, even disgusting demands of the frog (and her father!).   The step-mother in ""Snow-White"" is beautiful, but she needs to be the most beautiful of all. Her envy and recklessness, her life-threatening attitude towards Snow-White leads to her terrible death. Snow-White is the most beautiful of all, but she is arrested in a quasi death status from the very beginning. She, not unlike her step-mother, lets herself over to seduction of pretty things. Finally she becomes a ""beautiful jewel in a tresor of glas"", really beautiful to look at and placed on the top of a mountain, so that everybody may see her! Spitting out the treacherous, seductive apple is the healing (with which she has been fed by her step-mother).;I really appreciate the article you posted here, because it refers to a variety of gender aspects discussed in this forum. One of my favourite questions is this: ""Why did we lose all those male counterparts to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and the girl who becomes the wife of the Frog King?""My simple answer would be: Because the boys, when they came of age, entered the real, challenging world: They went abroad, journeyed to foreign countries in the trading business, as students or (most exciting) as explorers like Georg Forster or Alexander von Humboldt, they became independent. Whereas the young, well educated, intelligent women stayed at home, in the golden ""bird-cage"" of their fathers or husbands. Where could they travel else than in their fantasy? Why should they tell stories about dragons and ogres and female knights? They wanted to be powerful queens. They wanted to be admired and loved: because if they were not in reality, can you imagine such a life of tristess?The Grimms collected ""their"" fairy tales in a quite comfortable, completely unmagical way: they found female narrators in befriended families: these pretty, sophisticated, intelligent women. Than, because the female versions were at times quite slippery and too obviously connotated with female (especially sexual) needs, they overworked them, made them attractive to a possibly male, quite more often to an audience of children. (You may find interesting following links on 2 German magazine articles: http://www.zeit.de/zeit-geschichte/2012/04/Maerchen-Brueder-Grimm-Urspr _nge: ""M _rchen  _ber M _rchen"" and http:www.zeit.de/2012/50/Brueder-Grimm-Maerchen-Roelleke: ""Weder deutsch noch Volk""; Heinz R  lleke is a Professor emeritus of German Philology and an Expert on the Brothers Grimm).Hope you like my comment;Exactly! A lot of them   (and maybe those who became the most famous ones) were of French origin. First the Grimms did not know themselves. When they knew about it, they kept silent, because they wanted to work on a real German folkloristic collection. Of course in a sense they made them their own: because they overworked them.I was astonished myself when reading these Articles!;As I am mother of two girls (12 and 10 years old) I have a perspective from both sides:   as the story-teller of bedtime stories to my girls and as a former child listener to these stories.Yesterday we (girls and I) talked about the Grimm fairy tales and it turns out that they both have different favorite ones. The older one loved the seven raven; she was really scared about Hansel and Gretel, especially about the witch. The younger one loved Rapunzel and Sleeping beauty (Dornr  schen) and The Goose-Girl.   Both found their way to understand the tales and ignore those parts, they were scared of or which they didn't really understand. When they were very small I ""censored"" the stories, where they were extremely punishing to the vicious step-mothers. My younger daughter yesterday evening begged me to read Sleeping beauty and Snow-White to her. She had a good night's sleep afterwards!I myself, when I was a child,   loved the Grimm tales: My favorite tales were Hansel and Gretel and The Beauty and the Beast (which was no Grimm tale but a French one). Of course I enjoyed a lot of other fairy tales too, but these were my favorites.The ""In"" and ""Out"" as you put it is most certainly sexually connoted. During my reading of the Household stories for this course I stumbled over some interesting sources in a German magazine, Die Zeit online. It is said there, that the Grimm brothers collected a great deal of their tales from young, well educated women. The fairy tales often were so obviously sexually inclined, that they overworked them to make them more ""children-compatible"".

She take themes from the originals and lets them play out. In the case of Rapunzel, the witch more explicitly exhibits sexual desire for the young Rapunzel, wanting to possess her in every way but also needing to hide away to do this triply transgressive thing (bondage, rape, homosexuality). Sexton explores the darker underpinnings suggested by the tales but also delights in that darkness. When the prince arrives to seduce Rapunzel, it is as if the whole of ""normal"" society has reasserted itself to rescue her from the witch's depravity. But the tone is hilariously light: he ""dazzles her with his dancing stick."" In the Lucy Crane version, apart from the use of the word ""wife"" that follows right on the heels of the prince's visit, there is also a tantalizing detail a couple of lines later when we learn that the witch and the prince trade off seeing Rapunzel during the night and day (though the witch doesn't realize this at first). Rapunzel is poised between traditional socio-sexual norms and the opposite. But, crucially, she seems to choose the prince (whereas she gave not consent to her bondage by the witch, clearly). As a way of reinforcing Judeo-Christian norms, the Grimm tales are not afraid to evoke fear and loathing.;The Freudian analysis (which I suspect we'll encounter throughout the class, given Prof. Rabkin's proclivity) is certainly not the only reading; it's one among many, and some may object to it vociferously (if I can ""say"" that online). I, for one, found it a stretch in Hansel and Gretel. Given that many of the originators of these tales were spinning women, I can imagine a very different set of intentions animating those characters. As far as the back story goes, of course we invent back stories and futures for our characters, or we're tempted to do so. From early childhood, we've wondered ""and then what happened?"" BUT, when you invent a back story, whether you're a professor or not, you are inventing, and you have to offer the kind of support that will make that invention compelling and/or convincing. In the case of Hansel and Gretel, I find it odd to give the father any kind of central position. He's utterly emasculated, and I can't see why we should read him as the ultimate desire of Gretel. Also, I think Prof. Rabkin gives Hansel short shrift when he argues that Hansel is basically a minor character who enables the females to duke it out. He exhibits cleverness and resourcefulness, if a lack of foresight with the crumb thing. In fact, he is a primary agent of their survival, whereas Gretel is the agent of revenge.   Rabkin needs Hansel to be minor because  he needs the ""crumbs-are-feminine"" thesis in order to support his larger reading across several tales.   Instead of the Freudian reading, I think the story reflects the importance of food for sustenance, the terrible things that the hungry might do for food, and the breakdown of the traditional family when the father can't keep his family happy, safe and well-fed (as we've seen, the tales reinforce a traditional  Patriarchal social model, and when that falls apart, bad things happen...women in control of families do bad things).  The gingerbread house is odviously another added bonus: to warn children away from excessive sweet consumption. The step-mother and witch  are two sides of the same coin (one won't feed them; one wants to eat them)--they are both associated with the corruption of love (food), not so much with procreation (except as that follows from food...which is less compelling, though it is Rabkin's argument). There's a lot more to be said, but I've got to go...suffice it to say that we don't have to accept the Freudian reading as authoritative, just interesting (and compelling for some).;"

Maybe I'm misrepresenting your perspective, but I don't think that the Grimm brothers were motivated to produce content for popularity's sake! Whilst they were attempting to collate 'volks tales' which had a universality, there is an undertone of morality, and especially around 'staying in one's place.' This is true across the Grimm collection, in cases where the nobility / royalty are the protagonists (as in 'Sleeping Beauty') as much as peasants ('Hansel and Gretel').

At the same time it seems to criticizing Grethel for her drinking and gluttony and selfishness, but then she uses her cleverness and comes out on top.   Your interpretation seems as good as any, but shouldn't they be taking a stance on whether or not her actions were moral or not?   After all, this is a fairy tale.   ;I always thought of fairy tales as needing a moral.   I thought they were meant to teach and reinforce social norms.   The whole idea of telling stories to children is to impart on them your cultural ideals and knowledge.   I can't really understand what the point of this type of story is without that.   Perhaps you are right that these stories are just about showing children how the world works.   My mind keeps coming back to that and then rejecting it.   I just find it so hard to believe someone would write stories for children to tell them that the world is random and uncaring.   ;Lindsay, I'm not sure that is a narrow view of fairy tales, though I think I phrased it narrowly.   Fairy tales and oral histories are what define a culture. They provide continuity from one generation to the next.   They don't just reinforce social norms.   They also provide a common understanding of morality and of the world.   These stories, having been collected and edited by the Grimm brothers, seem to lack in any of that to me.   They remind me more of a child telling me a story that doesn't really make sense.   It's just sort of ""And then this happened, and then this happened, etc.""   I guess I'm just having trouble with this material.   I've already read some of the stuff we will be covering and I've enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of it, but not these.   I keep trying to come up with a thesis, but then I try to look for a counter-example, and I always find one.   I tried looking at the relationship between Grethel and her master to figure out what it said about gender relations at the time or what it said about class relations. On the one hand, they seem to be treating Grethel as a bad person with their descriptions of her, but on the other hand her cleverness wins in the end.   She doesn't even have any growth as a character.   It's just so baffling.   Maybe I'll try to focus on a different story.   ;The reading does seem a bit intense.

I'm worried I'll end up writing some of the essays without getting through the books.

With the Grimm fairy tales I was going to start first, but then I saw that there were ""before you read"" videos getting posted every Thursday and I decided to wait for that.

They are in many ways subversive given that the other teachings around were more than likely religious where good is always rewarded, even if it is after one is dead.;Lindsay, glad you agree, that was one of the themes of my essay so hope you get to mark it   :-);Actually these weren't written for children.   I always thought they were as well.   I went to Wikepedia and read their page (I'm assuming it's accurate!) and found that they were German adult oral history and that in fact in later editions by the Grimms they had to be changed to make them more suitable for children, for example instead of kissing the frog to turn it into a prince the original story has the prices throwing the frog against the wall.   They changed wicked mothers into wicked step mothers, and who knew Rapunzel was an unmarried mother?   They took out most of the sex and left in a lot of the violence, something we seem to do today that always seemed the wrong set of priorities to me.;To continue my thesis, I think it might be wrong to think of these stories as being generalizations on everyone's morality, or lack of it.   I see it more as ""some people will do this sort of thing so be aware of it as you go around the world"".   There are others where people gain and lose a lot of stuff but end up happy (is it called ""Happy Hans"" or something) some where good deeds are rewarded and some where they aren't, just like life.   In the ""Three Spinsters"" the girl gets out of doing work, is seen as clever for doing so, marries the prince and the three honest, but overworked and as a result ugly, women she dupes end up invited to the wedding so everyone lives happily ever after;"

Dodgson field of study was logic and I think he just loved to play around with words and structure showing how arbitrary and ambiguous communication can be, and of course he was doing that to amuse small children.   We learn by play and when we play with our language (puns) and sense of reality it helps that learning stick.   Play =fun=humor, so many jokes are based around the logically defensible but unexpected outcome, my kids' favorite was ""if your feet smell and your nose runs, you could be built upside"" down, which is a close kin to ""what's black and white and read all over?""   the answer to which is of course, an embarrassed zebra...or not;PS, I think I would argue that the answers to riddles always are ""logical"" if looked at with the right frame of reference;Suzanne, this is an interesting discussion that has set me thinking as to why I am not offended.   Part of the answer is has been expressed above, they are just stories, but when you get past that where do you go?   Personally, Grimm's   tales are not stories I would tell my children today.   However, they are there and part of the history of fantasy and as such have their place in this course.   Perhaps looking at them in that way, and contemplating how far we have come since they were written, can put a more positive spin on them.   The world today is not violence free but was much more violent in the past, perhaps these stories were preparations to assist people in understanding what might happen to them in their life.   Even today we are not short of violent stories but we protect our children from them by rating movies etc.   It's an interesting balance, protecting and at the same time making sure our children know how to handle life in the raw when they are grown up and outside of our influence.   How many of us have actually seen a person die?   Yet it is a place we are all going and I am not sure just hiding death as much as we can is a positive thing.   I'm not advocating televising hangings but some familiarity with the process might remove some of the dread and fear about something we are all going to experience at some point.   Another point, these are not the only violent books around that are considered universal and revered, both Shakespeare and the Old Testament are pretty bloody when you get right down to it.I have much more difficulty with your reaction to the Alice Books.   The ""Off With His Head"" is an empty threat, somewhere in there either the Gryffon or the King says that it never happens so in my mind the Queen becomes a source of humor just like someone having an empty headed tantrum.   It shows how silly people look when they go around making empty impossible threats.   The rest is so chock full of playful puns and silly logic that it has amused children for a long time.   We need people who have flexible thought patterns, not rigid unchanging beliefs, if we are to improve civilization (at least in my opinion) so this sort of playful ""logic"" is a great teaching tool on how ambiguous rules and words can be.Hope that helps;I'm thinking about using, as the theme for one of my essays, the relationship between the reading and a more modern piece, in other words what are the common threads and how I think this reading influenced more modern fantasy and SF.   The instructions say not to discuss the reading in modern terms but I take that more as in instruction not to do something like using the story of Cinderalla to debate the plight of women in the 1800's and how much of that plight does or does not remain.   My point will be to focus on the piece as a foundation for more modern writing, tracing a lineage.This will be somewhat in the vein of the last lecture where Prof. Rabkin pointed out the Greek myth roots of the fairy tales.

It was this that added to the word count.   I had to use a Mac version of word, apparently you can also use a plain text editor;Thanks Kate, I finally took a look at the added stuff and concluded it was Word formatting information but I couldn't strip it out.   I tried again with the version of Word I have on my Mac at home (The original that gave problems was done on my Windows PC at work and I e-mailed myself a version at my home address) and it now works so either you did something or this was a Windows Word versus Mac Word difference.   ;An interesting mixed bag, two that were obviously from non English writers, one that had a very thin thesis and two reasonable ones.

Why must people drag (and I mean drag kicking and screaming) sex into everything.   I get sexual innuendo in the fairy tales and in Dracula but in Alice!   I don't know that the Victorians understood the concept of adolescence and struggling with sexuality, and eveb if they did I don't know if it was a problem at 7!   I find it much more believable that it's all about the bewildering set of adult social rules and strictures that a 7 year old would have found strange and meaningless.   Please don't go from Victorian social mores to repressed sex, I understand that but you know sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.    End of rant!!!!;"

I do think you have to have a coherent structure and any observation you make about the work has to be backed by reason so by definition you have to have some sort of thesis.   You can't just say, I like vampire stories, you have to say why this particular vampire story is interesting.

Those older stories can in turn be traced back to even older stories, which were likely taken across with different migrations of people and language over a long period of time. It's my understanding that there's an awful lot of conjecture about the Indo-European precursers (Linear A and Linear B I think) which means that these story elements are similarly best-guess theories. That being said, there was a lot of trade along the Silk Road since at least the Roman times, and stories would have been exchanged forwards and backwards over that period. With humerous mistranslations, one imagines. ;)I'd love to find out if there are any story motifs which are shared with the Aborigine peoples in Australia, because they're the oldest continuous lineage of people and story that we know of. Although the Amerindian tribal heritage would show a lot as well, because again they were isolated for a long time.My guess is that there'll be loads of things which are culture-specific, like ... seven swans, or golden fruit; but there will be more general ideas, like rewarding innate nobility and punishing the selfish, which are more universal.

It's not really a horror story at all, more of a classic redemption-through-love theme with some nice religious iconography. It's perfectly possible to view it as a doomed romance as well (I love those, I'm firmly in Team Eric's camp in Phantom of the Opera too).;I had a big problem with the ink elephant scene in Dumbo as a kid too. Conversely though, I thought The Fountain was amazing, and that had a lot of dream-sequence like things in it too, and I adore all of Sandman. I think it depends on the level of absurdity for me. My dreams are usually much more... real-world rational I guess, so I just don't understand the appeal of stuff like Alice.;You make a valid point there, I don't really like private-language things generally, and whereas with Sandman I can sit and feel clever for getting a good chunk of them, with Alice I'm a century out of date for the social stuff and a doctorate in Mathematics away from understanding the pure maths elements I am assured it contains. I like Shakespeare though and I'm even more out-of-date with that...I forgot about the heffalumps and woozles. I didn't like them either. I think it all made me feel slightly nauseous as a kid.

I grant you that the book allows her to be clever and valued for it, which was part of a change in society at large, but she's still very much a passive participant in the novel.

I've given that piece of advice in both course markings so far, and I received it on my first essay too. The times where I gave it have been where someone touched on what I found a very interesting idea as a throwaway line, when the essay was about something completely different.When I received it, it was more like the scenario that Megan described, although I was definitely of your opinion, that the essay was about the whole idea (justice) rather than the individual parts which made up my argument (justice at the hands of the law, justice at the hands of nature/magic, the stories as a means of social control, and the evasion of justice by the powerful or sufficiently clever). I learned my lesson in the Alice essay and kept it much more tightly focussed. The essay I wrote for the first topic was definitely the one I put more work and thought in to, but it really needed at least another thousand words to, er, give it justice (sorry for pun...). All of the points I'd touched on would have individually made a great 300 word essay, but as a whole I agree that it feels too crammed with ideas.My Alice essay stuck much more closely to one idea (loss of identity) and was a tighter essay accordingly. (I got a 4 for both of them though. Go figure.) I still illustrated the point in different ways and mentioned different examples (identity as tied to one's nature, and how children construct the identity of others this way almost exclusively), but the theme of the essay ran through it much more effectively than my first one had. It remains to be seen whether I can keep the same tightness of focus through the course though. I get pretty waffle-y. You might have noticed.;"

It won't improve them, but it might help.;I happened across a snippet of information which I thought might be found useful by everyone.Mary Shelley wrote this book in 1816, after a miserable summer. The reason that the summer was miserable is because in April 1815 the volcano Mount Tambora had erupted, and threw so much ash into the atmosphere that 1816 was known as ""the year without a summer"" - it's like the nuclear winter of Cold War terror but with a natural origin and no radiation.I'm not sure how much the science of the day understood about the cause of their miserable summer, but they certainly understood the effects it had on their farming and livestock..The ash in the upper atmosphere produced incredibly dramatic sunsets and sunrises, which we have records of in paintings. Shelley was clearly inspired by nature and the natural phenomena she saw, and the circumstances might have been of slightly more significance than just leading her to stay inside a lot that year: the famine caused by the weather was proof of man's inability to defeat nature, and as a highly intelligent and thoughtful woman, I wouldn't be surprised if this was in the back of her mind when writing Frankenstein.The wikipedia article about this is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer  and it actually mentions Shelley and Frankenstein right down the bottom.

I think The Country of the Blind was more of an investigation into the saying, and what would actually happen when you get a society which knows no sight, rather than the investigation Wyndham did in Day of the Triffids, which was much more about the falling apart of society and the specific horrors which could (perhaps would) be committed under those circumstances. Wyndham did similar investigations in The Kraken Wakes and The Chrysalids, just not with blindness as a starting premise.The temptation when one is in a position of power is to abuse it. Most of us keep our abuses to fairly low-grade things, but some people do terrible things because they can; what they do changes depending on the situation, but not the reason why. Nunez in Country of the Blind is clearly one of the former type rather than the latter. He is not a particularly violent man, he doesn't want to hurt the blind people, and once he realises that actually he's not in a position of power he knuckles down and gets on with things.  (Of course, there are some saintly people who never abuse their position of power, but it's a lot harder to do than most people realise. I've seen people try. It requires scrupulous honesty and constant self-awareness.)So to answer your question: we live in both. We are capable of both amazing co-operation and selflessness, and horrific abuses of power and privilege. Our society is balanced between them very carefully. What would happen in a disaster such as Wells imagines in The Star, or Wyndham in his disaster trio, or Max Brooks in World War Z, is still up for debate.;All of the examples you gave there Sean are examples of military action, which is different than civilian situations. Not only that, they're examples of extreme racial prejudice in two of your cases: Kosovo and Nanking were as much about racial hatred as they were about control of the population, lending itself much more easily to abuses, and Vietnam had a huge amount of ideological propaganda behind it which also doesn't help with viewing other people as, well, real people.There aren't many modern examples of disaster situations where the local, national or international government hasn't stepped in pretty quickly, but it seems that in the first instance of disaster, most people don't immediately start looting, desecrating the dead, and raping each other. Not everyone commits acts of heroism or altruism either, but you get significant examples of it. It's the long-term aftermath where the constructs of society start to break down that's likely to lead to these situations of extreme abuses of power, and fortunately we don't have examples of those situations for a long time. The only historical examples I can think of are the withdrawal of the Roman legions from the north of Europe, the fall of the Minoan civilisation, and... er... that's all I've got, my world history is crap, most civilisations fall from invasion rather than disaster. (The Roman withdrawal is really a debatable one too. It's not like it was overnight, but a lot was lost in Britain.) I think maybe the fall of the first line of Pharoahs in Egypt? There was a big gap there.My point is, there's a lot of evidence that military action lends itself well to abuses of power over civilians, but in a societal collapse, the military falls just as quickly as the rest of us do. Sometimes faster. Fragments will remain, most militaries are better placed to retain structure and discipline, but it really would depend on the type of disaster. Zombies? They're the first in line. Plague? Just as liable to catch it. Nuclear holocaust? Better prepared by far.I read Wyndham as a teenager. Thinking about it, that might not have been my father's super-best recommendation.Also, re: The Kraken Wakes - it has a really good and subtle discussion about mental illness, specifically depression and PTSD, at a time when that couldn't be talked about much.

The hero he talks about is one that he refers to as Promethean, someone who, like Prometheus goes outside of the usual security of his own society in order to bring them back some great gift, and who, in doing so, sacrifices himself for the common good. He also looks at other things such as tricksters that see to be fairly ubiquitous, the aboriginal one taking the form of a crow.  I also remember seeing some footage once of Pete Seeger discussing how the same tunes are sometimes found in the folk music of different cultures. Songs can be played using different scales or modes, depending on where in the world they're being played and still sound the same in the same way that stories can be told in one part of the world in one way and in another part of the world in another way and still remain fundamentally the same.One of the things I love about literature is the way in which stories can pass so easily across boundaries of all kinds. People who might otherwise seem to be very different respond to the stories in the same way.

The following is what I wrote for my essay   to give me a bit of back-up for this silly idea. Let me know what you think!Lewis Caroll is the author of whimsical, imaginative, and incredible tales.  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland  is a tale of a world gone mad. While Alice is quite rational in the real world, I argue that she is quite mad in the context of Wonderland.Within the novel, Alice seems to be confused about what and who she is. When she encounters the mother pigeon in the woods, she tries to explain what she is. She sputters, ""'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you! [...] I-I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully"". (Caroll, Location 385) Almost every encounter she has makes her question her beliefs in the order of the world. By the time she reaches the Caterpillar, she can only tell him, ""'I-I hardly know [who I am], sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then'"". (Caroll, Location 320)The Cheshire Cat is the one who really points out what kind of fantastic and nonsensical place Wonderland is. When they meet, the Cheshire Cat says, ""'We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad. [...] You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here'"". (Caroll, Location 480)It is quite obvious that she is unable to understand even the simplest things, such as words, in Wonderland. When she asks the Mouse to tell his story, he says ""'Mine is a long and sad tale!' said the Mouse [...] 'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?'"". (Caroll, Location 200)Alice enters Wonderland with a fixed sense of the order of the world. Her core beliefs are challenged at every turn, and she questions who she is throughout the entire piece. Wonderland is ruled by nonsense, and her normal bahavior does not fit in, causing her to become mad within that environment.;Alice never questions what her name is, but she is constantly questioning who she is throughout the novel. As she makes her journey, she encounters many rude and curious creatures and situations. Although she is in a world of nonsense, she reacts to many things with logic and rationality--which, in Wonderland, is actually madness because everything is topsy-turvy.;"

I definitely sensed that in many instances he used the book as a way bash the New Woman movement, and near the end of the book it felt a little too forced how all of the men were going leaps and bounds to try to protect Mina from any kind of discomfort, even mild mental discomfort from the discussions of their daily vampire hunts.At the same time though, I think Stoker did do a good job in general of showing how men and women can compliment each other. The men were focused and determined, but Mina also reminded them of the truth that nobody else thought about--that Dracula too was a victim, that at one point he was a person turned sour like Lucy was. Mina also brought a different perspective to the notes and journals that they had was able to help them track down Dracula.While at times the characters in the book sometimes seemed a little harsh towards women's abilities in general, I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate this to Stoker's view of women in general. Stepping out of our cultural understanding for a moment and thinking about the culture in the book, this was considered normal. Something that has frustrated me about many pieces of historical fiction is the number of women who act outside of the societal norms for the time. It's just not very believable.;I absolutely loved this book. I was not overly thrilled at first to see that it was in the form diaries and letters, but I came to enjoy this style of writing as it made me feel more a part of the book and the characters.I do agree that for all their carefulness, there were a few times when the party was strangely ignorant, such as the bat and Mina's condition. The bat maybe I could see as them not taking notice, especially if they have no reason to believe that Dracula knows they're searching for him. I feel like Mina's condition should have been a little more obvious to them, especially so shortly after the ordeal with Lucy. Again, maybe I could let it slide that the possibility of Dracula's knowing and coming after them didn't cross their minds, but it was still kind of silly for them.Other than that though, I didn't really have any problems with the book. I really enjoyed the way it started too, focusing on Jonathan's journal while at Castle Dracula and then leaving you off to wonder if he died out there or made it out somewhere.;While I agree there's a lot of symbolism and parodies in Carroll's books... it could be he picked it just because.

So at Piccadilly, that means he would have been in his human form.I imagine that the reason he was attacking them was because he returned to Carafax to sleep, but found that his coffins had been sterilized, and so was now hurrying to his other coffin locations in spite of the daylight to make sure they were safe, rather than sleeping as he had planned.;"

Even once they're able to accept it on the surface, they're not thinking like people used to the supernatural when Mina is being attacked. Also, I've noticed that the sexism toward Mina, after she put everything together and indeed, went on their earlier expeditions with them, is so over-the-top (unlike how it's depicted in the rest of the novel) that I think the author was making the point that their very urge to protect and shield her and keep her in the dark was exactly what put her in danger. It's not the usual take that I find in Victorian novels, and I found it refreshing.;I wrote my essay about how the vampire hunters made a big deal about how they had to leave Mina behind in order to protect her.

He makes endless references to how much he wants to kiss the little girls, playfully  enumerating how many kisses he wants to give them.   That--combined with his statements about his love of the nudity of little girls--makes me question his intentions.   And though the book  doesn't contain many overt sexual references,   it makes many memorable references to food, which as Professor Rabkin has suggested, can sometimes be a stand-in for love, or sex.I'll admit that even after spending a year studying Carroll for my thesis, I'm still not comfortable coming to definitive conclusion about his desires--but I do wonder.;The standards of the day were complex.   In Victorian England, the age of consent was 12 until 1875, when it was raised to 13.   So while children  were treated as cherubs, they were also sexualized.And Dodgson  didn't like the nudity of all children.   He only liked the nudity of little girls.   In one letter her wrote: ""I confess I do not admire naked boys.   They always seem to me to need clothes   whereas one hardly sees why the lovely forms of girls should ever be covered up.""In another letter he was playful about requesting the nudity of his child-friends.   To a mother he wrote:""At any rate, I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked; at her age, it seems almost absurd to even suggest any scruple about dress.My great hope, I confess, is about Ethel   _Do consider her case in reference to the fact that she herself is quite indifferent about dress.

It was still wrong - we know better.  ;From what I read, and my take after reading the book, Alice's Adventure in Wonderland is largely a story about growing up, and the struggle to retain and define an adult identity in a confusing and frequently nonsensical kind of world.  Throughout the story Alice changes size repeatedly, early on she has no choice but to do so (to get through the door), and later (in the rabbit's house) she drinks the bottle and changes size just ""because something interesting is bound to happen"", but these early changes tend to go awry and have discomfiting effects on her. Later though, after meeting the Caterpillar, she is finally able to return to her ""proper"" size, whereat she is most comfortable. Almost immediately afterwards, however, she uses the mushroom to adjust her size to match the March Hare's house, showing that she has gained some control over her changes, and is comfortable enough with herself to make those changes to accommodate others. It's a massive step forward for the little girl who cried so hard when she couldn't reach the key to get through the door.At the same time as these physical and psychological changes are occurring for Alice she goes through a number of different thought processes, such as her poignant question ""but if I've changed, then who am I?"" There are many quotations of this kind that follow Alice's development from scared and confused to confident and self-assured, though I haven't my notes with me to include them (all quotes above are also paraphrases, sorry).  ;It's probably not the greatest thing for you to take a no-compromise stance on, considering the easy availability of online dictionaries that could give you the word ""unintelligible"".  ;I'm glad someone else has raised this issue, because I felt a little uncomfortable broaching it. Of the 5 essays I marked, four of them were almost unreadable, the grammar and spelling was so bad. One of them was clearly a non-native speaker, for whom I had far more sympathy, and I did my best to evaluate all of them fairly, reserving comments on grammar and tone for the form section.  My concern is this: I'm a native speaker, with a BA in English, but live outside the US (and in fact in a non-English-speaking country). Is my location affecting the peers assignments I'm given? I could understand structuring a course so that people from similar geographic or demographic areas are lumped together, but if that is what's happening I'm going to be an outlier for my region.  ;Alice is trying to determine who she is, and trying to find a way to return to her ""proper size"", i.e a sense of self with which she is comfortable, in the face of all the demands Wonderland has of her to be another. Alice is still wary of changing, and tries to explain this to the caterpillar by suggesting that he will feel it queer when he changes into a chrysalis and then a butterfly.  The caterpillar rejects this and, what's more, doesn't see a need for him to explain who he is:  ""`I think, you ought to tell me who  YOU  are, first.'  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.""  Unlike Alice struggling to find her identity (proper size), the caterpillar embraces change, and rejects the need to explain or define himself for others. Finally, he gives Alice the tools necessary for her to change her size at will, which allows her at first to return to her ""proper size"", but then later to adjust her size according to the situation she finds herself in.;I think all literary works, in order to be successful, have to abide by their own set of internal laws. Even the most rigorous of realist fiction cannot follow precisely an exact replica of ""the laws of our physical universe"". In that regard he most certainly adheres to a very rigorous set of aesthetic laws which define the relationship between the writer and his audience.  Though things may happen to Alice seemingly at random, and the laws of physics twist and alter according to strange dream logic, yet Carroll is not free suddenly to change tack and start writing a murder-mystery novel. If you are asking whether he devised laws specifically to replace the conventional laws of physics (i.e if you cry a lot your tears will create a great lake of salty water) I would probably have to say no, but that's not to say hat the story doesn't progress along a logical (and indeed lawful) path, howsoever twisted that logic may be.  ;I agree with Cheri, the books are far too psychological, too internal, to translate easily into movies. I don't see why it shouldn't be possible to translate them into a different language though. Perhaps different languages might fare differently due to their inherent differences - I could see German working well, for instance, whereas those with entirely different structures or cultural backgrounds might interpret differently. As for the translations Anahita has read, well, maybe they're just bad translations.  ;You seem rather upset by this, and quite sure that your many quotations should have earned you ""at least a 5"", so let's take a closer look.  Overall, I agree with Peer 4. Your approach is certainly a worthwhile one, comparing the texts with some possible historical influences, but I'm afraid some grammar errors, odd sentence constructions, and opaque rather than concise writing makes your essay rather confusing.  In paragraph one, for example, in which you lay out your thesis, you make three statements:1.  The tale of  The Frog Prince  illustrates life during an age when class divisions were clearly defined. 2. The opening line    In the old times, when it was still of some use to wish for the thing one wanted    alludes to an innocent, heroic time in the past when status barriers were not so important. 3. Moreover, plot elements derived from mythology and the biblical account of David are incorporated to sustain the value of hope, as well as the elusive promise of deliverance.The first two statements are contradictory, and the third unrelated to them. Your use of the word ""moreover"" suggests to the casual reader that the following sentence will provide more evidence for the argument presented previously, but that is not the case.Para 2: ""Reminiscent  of"", if you please.  Para 3: ""However, distain is not so easily overcome."" I assume you meant ""disdain"", but even granting you that this sentence is neither supported by additional arguments, nor does it introduce or relate to the remainder of the paragraph. Also, I don't think you know what disdain means.  At the end of this paragraph you draw a comparison between the Princess and Odysseus's wife, Penelope. In the Odyssey, Penelope is alone at home, her husband presumed dead, while dozens of suitors invade her home, drinking her food, and trying to persuade her to marry them. She holds off the suitors by with constant delays until eventually her husband returns home to slaughter them. If this were parallel with the frog prince story Odysseus would return home only to be rejected by Penelope and cast away. Perhaps you could have compared the Frog Prince to Agamemnon, for whom that was exactly what happened.This inaccurate comparison continues through paragraph 4. Without better supporting evidence this comparison falls apart. It survived only so far as it did because you misrepresent at least one myth with which your peers were not familiar.  As for your conclusion, faithful servant characters occur in basically every body of literature, from Lord of the Rings to the Iliad, as well as a dozen Grimm tales. Pointing out that they reoccur here is no great insight, I'm afraid. Given all of this, your last sentence, ""It's possible to conclude then, that attitudes concerning designated sub-classes were revealing, and in hoping to overcome them, was oftentimes met with hostility, violence and grief"", is really hard to justify. It's also really hard to read.I'm sorry if all this seems harsh. It's because of the awful noise my irony meter has been making ever since I read the lines: ""P.S. I'm sure it didn't enrich your reading - you have to actually read something for that to happen."", and ""it's the sheer arrogance that annoys me"";I like your central idea here, that in the Grimm tales objects and comparisons can serve as an indication of growth, though it could certainly have been carried far deeper. Did you consider contrasting this idea with Lucky Hans, who slowly loses all his possessions?;I'm a little hesitant to post my assignment as I was a little late catching on to the rhythm of this course and suddenly realized at work that I had only 12 hours to turn something in. As a result the writing is rather poor and I was fairly horrified to find when I got it back that there were grammar errors. Nevertheless, I have commented on others essays here, and in the spirit of fair play I feel it only appropriate to allow them the same opportunity.My grade was 4 which, under the circumstances, is probably appropriate.  Words That BindInvocatory rhymes in the Brothers Grimm   s tales reveal the special power that spoken words have to transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel the listener within and without the oral tradition of folk Germany.  The repetitive use of short, incantatory passages, such as,        ""Flounder, Flounder in the sea,              Hither, quickly come to me,              For my wife, dame Isabel,                Wishes what I scarce dare tell"" (The Fisherman and His Wife)performs the same mnemonic function as repetitive phrases in other works from oral tradition, such as ""Dawn with her rosy fingers"" (The Iliad), in that they are easy to remember, and provide a touchstone from which an oral story-teller can build. In the Brothers Grimm's tales they  also serve to bookmark and separate the story's different stages. The rhyming couplets given above are, in The Fisherman and His Wife, repeated six times, and every instance marks the beginning of a distinct stage in the story with a new set of demands, a new house for his wife,  and an increasingly [ed: grammar error repaired] agitated sea.Yet more than that, it seems to transcend the boundary between the worlds of the flounder and the fisherman, and to compel the flounder to appear before him and hear his wish. Boundaries are similarly transgressed in Rapunzel (""Rapunzel! Rapunzel!/Let down your hair!""), allowing the Prince (or the witch) entry into Rapunzel's tower sanctuary, and in ""The Almond Tree"", where the bird transcends death with his song to bring about the gory conclusion.In all instances these words seem to have a special power, both within the fantasy world of the tale and without. It is these phrases, after all, that best survive down through the centuries. Perhaps we, as readers, are comfortable granting these words such power within their own stories precisely because we recognize the very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without.Form Responses:peer 1      In general, this essay has good form. I would have just a couple minor quibbles. First, ""an increasibly agitated sea."" Do you mean ""increasingly""? Second, ""Yet more than that, it seems to transcend  _"" What is the ""it"" here? The repetitive use of invocatory phrases? You could make that a bit clearer to your reader.peer 2      Very good use of sentence structure, grammar, spelling and vocabulary. I particularly like the very direct and matter-of-fact style of writing you have adopted. Some of the longer sentences jarred slightly though, so it might be helpful to break them down into smaller sentences to make it easier on the reader.peer 3      The structure of this essay is clear and the use of a quotation from one of the tales gives to it a more appealing appearance and also adds to the essay rhythm. But even though the structure really helps to understand the message I think that the essay mixes two different ideas along the text: the repetition as a way to help the reader to follow the story and also the ""special"" power that those repetitions seem to have in the stories. I think that both of those interpretations of the repetitions would have been enough to build a whole essay on them. On the other hand if you wanted to put both of them in the same essay I think it would have been better and clearer to give to both of them the same presence in the text.Content Responses:peer 1      I most appreciate your attention to the idea that these passages ""transcend boundaries."" You could have perhaps limited yourself to just that point, and thereby had space to more thoroughly develop your three examples (flounder, Rapunzel, and Almond Tree). Given your opening sentence, I would have expected your essay to develop evidence that these passages transcend boundaries, reveal information, and compel listeners (within and without the tale). I'm not sure how much your paragraph that includes reference to the Iliad -- in which you point to the bookmarking and memorability of these passages -- contributes to your overall argument. I would have liked to see more development of your point about how the passages compel the listener outside the narrative of the story itself.peer 2      I very much like the way you've gone with this essay - I think focusing on the language used, rather than the symbology, was a very unique perspective and an interesting direction to take. You have presented the importance of the repetitions very persuasively. I am a little confused with the last sentence however; very real power they have to transcend boundaries in the world without. It would have been nice had you explained this a little further, perhaps given an example of how words such as this one have transcended boundaries outside of the stories themselves.peer 3      I really enjoyed your essay and the ideas you present in it. They way you created a relation between certain repetitions and how the stories move forward was really clear. Also the reference to the Illiad helps us remember that this narrative technique has been present since a really long time ago in many different works of art. But I think it would have been important to distinguish different uses of repetitions in the tales, for example, in one of the first tales in this collection, ""The Rabbit's Bride"", we have a repetition at the begining of the tale but the action doesn't change until the third repetition of a certain passage, there were no changes in the action or the characters after the previous two repetitions. For me, what would have made your essay a perfect one would have been to introduce that difference between the uses of the repetitions and then go for one of them and analyze it in detail.;And yet comments you shall have.  I'm sorry if you think the book is ""pure and utter madness"", because that's simply not the case. Irrationality and disorder are certainly strong themes in the book, but Alice herself is a fairly reasonable character struggling to adapt to a world full of incomprehensible practices, opaque rituals, and inscrutable characters. If you can't find some relevance to life in that, then I suspect you're not looking deep (or thinking wide) enough.  The books are  stuffed  with symbolism and imagery. If you're still having difficulty seeing that then pick up a copy of the book with an introductory essay and see what others have written about it.  ;And yet the locals live in fear of Dracula's castle, and it is Van Helsing's book learning that brings the creature to light and arms them to defeat it, freeing them all from the threat of the supernatural.;"

Lovecraft for essay writing and Doctorow for one of my Facebook posts.;I agree it is unfair that someone gave you a 1 based solely on grammar mistakes, however, you seem very resistant to the idea that you may need to improve your grammar.  I am an ESL teacher and I have seen this attitude a lot.  You seem to dismiss these grammar mistakes by saying that they are not critical, but minor mistakes are actually a big problem when it comes to essay writing. Multiple mistakes, no matter how minor, add up and they interrupt the flow of the essay and put a burden on the reader.  There is another major problem regarding grammar mistakes that has to do with perception. Students seems to think that minor mistakes are not a big deal but these mistakes often lower the reader's perception of the author's intelligence (whether on a  conscious or subconscious level)  . This, of course, is extremely unfair and illogical (if anything, recognizing that you can communicate effectively in a second language should raise their perception of your intelligence), but it is a reality.  Again, I really don't think you should have received a 1 based on minor mistakes in grammar but I also think that one of the points of this course is to identify how we can improve our writing.;Students seem to think-----oh how ironic :);I feel the same way you did about Alice in Wonderland. I found it clever and there were parts that made me laugh out loud, however, it was a little unsettling and I also found it a bit tiring to read. I also don't enjoy dream sequences or things that are too surreal (with the exception of paintings). They really hit me on a weird visceral level. For example, there is a little known movie called 'The Forbidden Zone' and it is exactly like someone recording a dream and it really freaked me out.;While I think Freud is interesting, and should be studied because he had such a profound effect on the field of psychology, I really am baffled by how many people cite his work as if it is still widely accepted in the scientific community. Most of Freud's ideas have been discredited, especially dream theory and penis envy, which seem to still be referenced a lot. There are so many interesting theories being studied right now in psychology and neuroscience and these ideas could easily be integrated into our essays. I just think analyzing a text based on Freudian theories is overdone. I don't think these Freudian theories add any level of deeper meaning to essays and I find them very tiresome and cliche.I don't want to make anyone angry and I am not trying to insult people who used Freud in their essays, because I am sure there were good essays that also referenced Freud. The professor spoke about Freud as well, so I am also assuming some people took their cues from his lectures. Again I am not trying to insult people. This is just my personal opinion. Are there others who feel this way as well, or am   I in the minority?  Also, don't worry I am not marking down papers because of my personal aversion to his ideas.  ;  I came across this article  http://boingboing.net/2007/10/15/neuroscience-of-alic.html   which has a link to an article  that described some possible neurological conditions exhibited by characters in Alice in Wonderland. It links some of these to afflictions suffered by Dodgson (like migraines and speech impediment). I suppose you could write an essay about the possibility that Dodgson's real life afflictions influenced influenced his writing, and also look at the implications of displaying and highlighting ''madness'' in Alice in Wonderland  in the context of  a society that basically locked away mentally ill people and kept them hidden away from the rest of society.  ;Your post is extremely aggressive. This type of post is actually the reason I don't think people should be able to post anonymously. I am not discrediting anyone's thoughts, I am simply stating that some of Freud's views are not accepted widely in modern Psychology. There has been a decline in psychoanalysis as well and its importance has waned in modern psychiatry. I believe this is because a lot of Freud's theories are not falsifiable which is a key component in the scientific method. I also understand that penis envy refers to children and not adults but that doesn't change the fact that it is generally not accepted anymore and it is misogynistic to the point of being absurd . I didn't say that everything Freud said was wrong. I acknowledged that he has had a very big influence. I also acknowledged that some people who cited Freud probably wrote interesting essays. All I said was that there are other sources out there that people can cite in addition to Freud. All in all it was a pretty innocuous statement that didn't warrant such an angry tirade.;The terminology isn't intimidating. I am just stating that penis envy isn't an accepted theory anymore. Sex is a huge factor in human behavior and it is a fascinating way in which to analyze readings. I am also an avid Dan Savage reader so i can pretty much handle any sex terminology you throw at me. Also, I studied anthropology/zoology as an undergrad, which involved a lot of genetics and human evolution courses, so I basically studied how sex drove us to become who we are. Actually if you are going to analyze readings and discuss theories on sexuality I imagine that there are a wealth of modern resources. Society has become more open so honestly more modern research may be more interesting/enlightening anyways. ;Agreed. I am living in Turkey at the moment and there are a lot of men and women who are uncomfortable talking about sex. I once made a mildly sexual joke in mixed company and instantly regretted it. Of course there are some people here that don't mind talking about sex but I have to be more cautious than if I were in some other places. ;"

There isn't a right or wrong way to analyze literature and that is why my annoyance with Freud hasn't been reflected in my grading. You categorize Freud as a philosopher rather than a scientist and I think that is an interesting and useful distinction because my bafflement was with using outdated scientific theories as if they were still accepted by the scientific community, but if you frame Freud as a philosopher then it makes it much more palatable.  Also, I do think essays using Freud can be interesting and enlightening but I wish the professor would mention other frameworks as well, as this might encourage students to be bit more diverse. I may have gotten a weirdly skewed batch but they were almost all Freudian theories, which is what prompted me to write this post.  ;Peter,   I am living in Turkey right now and when the riots broke out in Brazil I thought there were a lot of interesting similarities to the protests here. They developed th same way, with a harsh police crackdown being a catalyst for protesting other deeper issues. Also, the  majority of protesters were first time protesters, young and educated and not associated with a particular political party. There also seems to be some global references for protesting now, like wearing Guy Fawkes masks and the term ""occupy"" as in Occupy Wallstreet and Occupy Gezi.  I didn't realize protesters were talking about creating a new form of government in Brazil. That is really interesting. Keep us updated. ;Don't talk about the books influence on future works: Basically this just means you are analyzing those future works and not the book we were assigned.

Also, the things that I posted were really frustrating to me, because the essays that had these problems had the potential to be really good. For example, I reviewed a couple of essays with many different ideas that were unrelated to each other, and each of these ideas was interesting, but the overall essay was lacking any focus. I also reviewed two essays that talked about Alice in Wonderland's influence on future works. These essays were also interesting but they didn't follow the assignment. For the most part, these were not bad writers, they were just people who needed some guidelines to rein them in, and that is why I think this thread is really useful.  ;"

Rather unexpected, totally made my day :) The concept of    foreign-ness    and related anxieties play a critical role in Dracula.    Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,    says Dracula to Harker, underscoring his un-English ways. Transylvania is ruled tyrannically, is rife with superstitions, and breeds ancient horrors     in contrast to democratic, rationalist, modern England. Stoker, however, presents no easy dichotomy between the foreign and native. Transylvania   s superstitions are, after all, grounded in reality     one that the English (and the American) are ill-equipped to deal with due to the limitations of their narrow worldview. Harker, for instance, approaches Transylvania with an almost-colonial mindset, researching    books and maps    at the British Museum prior to his trip and deeming the warnings of local inhabitants    very ridiculous   . Dracula embodies the English fear of the powerful and unfamiliar    other   . He belongs to a    conquering race    whose spirit    would not brook that  _[they] were not free   . He has also appropriated all the tools necssary to masquerade as an Englishman: he is prodigiously well-read and familiar with the land   s language and laws. Thus, he is now dangerous to the English way of life. (Transylvanians who are viewed in a kindlier light are invariably powerless peasants.) This concern, however, is validated: not only does Dracula prey on his own subjects, but he also infiltrates    mighty London    to widen his hunting ground. In the end, Van Helsing     the benign foreigner who brings together the best of the scientific and the mystic     is ""the man to unmask...[Dracula] and hunt him out   . Van Helsing (like Stoker) has the advantage of an insider-outsider perspective: he is open to alternative truths (from legends about bats in the Pampas to the resurrection of Indian fakirs), but solidly anchored in the Western, Christian landscape. Dracula simultaneously holds the potential for both a critique of English assumptions about the foreign as well as an affirmation of the ultimate superiority of English moral values. ;Hey!

A book is much superior for   flicking back and forth to revisit particular passages, plus this particular edition of Household Tales does not allow for going straight to one particular story unless one remembers to take a note of the location. One has not been taking note. ;)I have managed this assignment but I suspect that time for doing the actual reading is going to become a problem as the course progresses. In your case, before you throw in the towel completely, could you consider due to the short word length of the essay, that it is not really possible to delve into every story in Grimm's, so maybe you could still have a go by picking one story and really examining it. You still have time. The essay is short.I am going to have a problem when we come to Dracula as I do not read vampire stories, no exceptions, so I don't know what I'm going to do about that.;Thank you, Anonymous 1. And thank you also, Anonymous 2 for trying to tempt me into watching Dracula. I shall not be moved.  Florencia, I don't really know why I can't watch or read vampires. I can't watch horror movies either, (they stay in my head for weeks, maybe months,) but I can read pretty much anything in the fantasy line, except vampires.  I don't read horror, and vampires have never successfully crossed out of horror and into fantasy in any positive way for me. I mean, they are the soul less, undead. What's to like about them?    I also am very bothered by the way they shun the sunlight. I am personally very affected by the absence of light and I think a creature who lives perpetually in the dark, must be more disturbed than we can begin to imagine. There is a natural healing in sunlight that vampires never receive. When I first saw the programme,    Hoarders,    I experienced a similar feeling of horror and revulsion towards them because they choose to live in filth, (always,) and darkness, (often.)   Like the vampires they have turned away from the light with all that metaphorically implies.    Finally, consider that a vampire can turn you into a vampire against your will, they can fly and they can move unnaturally fast. The moving very fast really gets to me. They look human but they move like a housefly. That   s just wrong.  So, to summarise, vampires are creatures of horror and never creatures of fantasy for me. I don   t read horror, and actually if this course had been called, Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror, I wouldn   t have even read the details.  I would just like to add that hoarders don   t bother me half so much as vampires. After all they can   t fly and are generally pretty slow moving. Though I don   t think I could ever step inside a hoarder   s house.  ;How fast can you move,Fredrik? :);Ha! You better stay in the sun all summer long! ;);I think this is a really good idea.

So, my little lost self in a whirl of summer school papers waiting patiently to be graded got the better of me! So here is my essay:  Within the context of fairy tales, many are set within a forest dealing with small children. The forest can symbolize  the journey all children must face when preparing to become adults, those dreaded teenage years. Each journey, like in Little Redcap and Hansel and Gretel, begin at home where the child feels secure with their parents and their parents looking out for them. However, when the story enters into its rising action the setting takes on a darker setting within a forest. The forest can be treacherous place which is a    dark night    (Grimm 88). Many of the characters find the forest to be frightening and have many encounters with    wild beasts    and    goblins    (214, 138).    Forests are home to creatures like ""witch[es],"" ""dwarves,"" and many different types of animals. Some of the beings can be benevolent and kind. While yet, others are referring to challenging individuals every child must face through their teen years. For instance, in Hansel and Gretel the children arrived at a house after their long journey, only to find a witch who wanted to eat them for supper. After much planning and conniving by the children, they managed to overcome the witch obstacle and go home with plenty of money. Many children face multiple kinds of obstacles in their journey throughout life.  The forest may be a symbol of a journey through life complete with the obstacles children must face in order to be adults. No one can teach the children some of these lessons except for experience and these stories teach us, the audience, that childhood is a journey through the woods with wolves and witches to snatch us on our way.

I guess it has been a long time since I  have looked at the Grimm Brothers material.  The stories were not meant for very young children.  There are many things that would be very disturbing to sensitive young people.  For example the story of Hansel and Grethel tells about children being abandoned by their parents.  Another story with a similar theme is The Brother and Sister.  Each is played against the other.The Grimm Brothers also used other themes that would be lost on youngsters.  People need to be careful when they choose their friends and partners is another topic and conversing with animals, which I realize is the fantasy part, also a topic that children wouldn't understand.  These underlying areas make any kind of depth possible for the young reader.  The Grimm Brothers also seemed to use numerology.  They liked the numbers three and twelve.  A lot of the stories had three characters or the main character met three other people .  An example of this would be The three Spinsters and The Mouse The Bird and The Sausage.  I will say most of the stories do have happy endings.  Is this an expected ending or is it justified?I question whether these stories are actually appropriate for children or should they be given to older teens and see what they can make of them.  I think that The Brothers Grimm could probably be a course in itself.  It might've very interesting to delve into the meaning of all the in's and out's of these fairy tales.  What were the brothers thinking when these stories were written?

I thought it was midnight.;I am taking another Coursera course concurrently, and that one has an ""Assignments"" tab. That makes it much easier, and I was also looking for that here.;This is very interesting! I considered writing my essay about people using disguises in order to enact justice, but I hadn't thought about cloth itself as a metaphor for fate. You're right. Many characters tried to change fate by wearing certain cloths, but it did not always work.There are also stories in which disguising oneself with cloth is what leads to fate playing itself out, such as Maiden Maleen.;I agree, and your essay goes hand-in-hand with mine. (Though you might not necessarily agree with mine.) My thesis is that the stories promote the social structure of the time, though at first they appear to promote an overthrow of it. Because there is so much social movement within the stories, it leads the reader to believe in some sort of ultimate fairness or justice that will occur, in which people with virtues will be rewarded and end up holding higher places in society, and people with vices will not.;Here is my essay for the first assignment:  Grimm   s Fairy Tales promote, over and over, that an individual should accept his/her prescribed social role while acting fairly and honestly within it. At first glance the assessment that individuals should accept their roles in society might seem counter-intuitive since many stories involve characters that are poor or in lower positions within society overthrowing Kings or otherwise triumphing and moving up the social ladder.A closer look makes it clear that, on the whole, the stories do not advocate an overthrow of the social structure, however. When a lower class individual overthrows or outsmarts someone with more power, it is generally because that person has already been established as unfair. A lower class individual is portrayed as a villain when outsmarting a fair, honest person of stature. For example, the peasant in Old Hildebrand is the hero because he outsmarts the parson who wants to spend a day with the peasant   s wife, something that involves dishonesty. The waiting-maid in The Goose-Girl is not a hero for outsmarting the Princess, however, because that Princess wasn   t established as a bad person in any way.This morality is an    eye for an eye    type of philosophy rather than one focused on ideals. Breaking the social rules as a means to a greater end is fine, i.e., although trickery is despised, it is lauded when used to bring down those who used it first and are no longer considered innocent. Honesty and fairness, although highly valued, are not valued above all. Once a person has done something dishonest or unfair, the general social rules do not apply to them. Kings can then be overthrown and servants may be mistreated. This is considered justice, and those who apply it are heroes. This is seen in a multitude of stories, such as King Thrushbeard, in which the Princess is being haughty and rejecting all suitors. The King   s deceit is a good thing that both teaches the Princess a lesson and brings her greater happiness in the end. (I would argue that the Princess wasn   t doing anything wrong in the first place, but clearly she was according to the author and the social rules of the time.);Thanks for commenting on my essay. I appreciate it. I wrote it in a word processing document and was well under the word limit,   but then made some tweaks after pasting it here and I forgot to recheck it.  I think I left out a strong conclusion because I wrote something longer than the assignment. Next time I will be more careful to make sure an entire essay fits within the constraints given to us.

Here it is:On the Grimm Brothers fairy tales I found a common subject: the reward for your virtue or vice.  In the tales, virtues as  humility as the goose girl who takes the job without protesting, sagacity as Clever Gretel who fools his master, solidarity as the companions on the six soldiers and many more are rewarded with the deserved kingdom, the desired pleasures and a treasure respectively. In the other hand vices have their pay back; nonsense (Hans in luck loose all what have earned), avarice (the waiting-woman is killed for her betrayal), and selfishness (the hen even causes the dead of all the animals around her).Hern  ndez, Isabel (2012) arghes that all those tales where actually taken from oral tradition. The original ones were told in order to lecture the young ones about everyday life: you should be wise so you obtain good deeds (Six soldiers of fortune, Clever Gretel) and don't be foolish (Hans in luck), not to go to dangerous places (Little red-cap).  All this is presented via universal subjects, common to all ethnics and persistent in time such as love, hatred, marriage and human relationships, even when all those have changed in time. A prove of that is that is that adaptations of the same stories are used today with the same goal.I am an amateur storyteller. When you tale a story, you don't tale it exactly as it was written.

Take, for instance, in the story of Six Soldiers of Fortune, where one of the men lays down to sleep in the middle of a race where, were he to lose, his head would be chopped off. Animals all seem to be anthropomorphic, with many capable of talking to humans (as the horses in The Goose Girl story, who speak even post-mortem). These elements add a fantastical touch even in stories that lack magic in a significant form.                        As well as keeping to the unrealistic and fantastic, the stories waste no words or time, many of the stories spanning a short amount of time, with only a few vague descriptors, usually to promote the beauty (or lack thereof) of a character; as with the princess in The Goose Girl. While the fantastic nature and the lack of descriptive language of the stories would appear simple and childlike (as the stories are meant for children), the dark subject matter of the stories appears to conflict with the stories construct.

The Maiden of the fairytale, a young girl, is responsible for the cabbages, for, when she is not there, the rabbit will eat them and the household (the smaller unit of society) will be out of food. Both Persephone and the Maiden are stolen in nature     the first when collecting flowers, the latter protecting the cabbages- by a figure symbolizing death.         Seeing the Rabbit   s Bride as Persephone, the Hare is Hades and his hutch the Underworld. The Hare, the Crow and the Fox in many mythologies are linked with death and trickery, being cunning, attractive, convincing but also dangerous and deathly. However, in the land of the dead, life can start over by a marriage, that will lead eventually to birth of children. Unlike Persephone, the Maiden never gets married to the Hare. Instead a figure made of straw    dies    and remains in the Underworld in her place reminding us of the Christian belief or the Platonic philosophy that when our body dies, our spirit goes on living. In the case of Persephone and the Maiden, they both return home continuing to protect earth   s vegetation and marking the continuing circle of life.       As a last not, fairytales, even though they are considered as stories for children, include complex mythological, philosophical and religious notions, blending traditions of different cultures and making them available to young kids in a simple, non-threatening and interesting way.  ;"

I would appreciate any feedback.The Grimm Fairytales are unique stories, because they use animal characters to impart moral lesson to people. At a casual reading, the analogies to humans are not evident, but on closer perusal, one can see how animals are used to represent the vulnerabilities of human character in a distanced and objective way.       The Rabbit   s Bride    follows the story of a tactless Rabbit who imposes demands on an innocent maiden.    Sit on my tail,       get to work and cook some bran and cabbage,    and    Get up! Get up!    he orders the maiden, treating her like a housewife. When the maiden escapes, the Rabbit is left    very sad,    concluding the moral of the story: those who demand selfishly only end up alone and unhappy. Through the character of the Rabbit, the reader can recognize the man that is portrayed, a counter-example of good principles.         The Death of the Hen    similarly uses animals to illustrate a warning for human beings about following others. The hen   s death from choking on a nut sends the cock in grief, which then moves all the beasts to mimic the cock   s lament. The animals follow him to a dangerous brook, where one by one, all, except the cock and dead hen, drown trying to cross the brook. Finally following after the hen, the cock    sat himself down and lamented so sore that at last he died.    For a fairytale, this story resonates tragically. The story exaggerates the folly of offering to help beyond one   s capabilities, a lesson being that there is nothing that left to do for one that has died, but there is no need to follow after.    The Grimm Fairytales are fantasies, woven around animal characters who do impossible things, but they are also imbedded in reality. They remain with people today, in the minds of children and adults, because the stories cautionary warnings about human nature in a memorable way.    Word count: 316  ;"

The mother started the lie, the daughter can be seen as being loyal to the mother by not correcting the lie and therefore sullying the mother's word/reputation.   Then at the wedding the daughter/bride invites the three women in   as opposed to other girls in other tales who are cruel/break promises   to ugly characters and thereby incite their wrath. By keeping her word to the spinsters the daughter is rewarded by never having to spin again (or I guess actually   fake spinning again).     My point is I saw the girl as a dutiful daughter and keeper of promises (which is why she was rewarded), even if she was lazy and wouldn't learn to spin. :)And as an aside I can also see a more modern feminist reading of this as the solidarity of women-hood or some such--but sometimes I think we read more into these tales than we should :)Any way--just something that popped in my head. I meant this to light and fun in tone--not something that always comes across on the internet!;I totally agree that the mother and daughter were cunning. I think that's part of what I like about this story. And I understand the spinster/fates connection.  I also think I personally enjoy this story as a tale of the lower class/underdog 'getting one over' on the upper class.   If the situation were reversed and the Queen or Prince were taking advantage of a peasant and her daughter I would think that the tale was just awful.

Throughout the books there are references to lessons (which are often cited incorrectly).

Students recite things over and over without any actual understanding of what they are doing, yet creativity and passion is ultimately lost.;Do not think of the book as being set in Wonderland. Imagine that you are a child in Victorian England: the absurd societal rules that do not make any sense, the easily offended characters, the prudish and snobbish nature of society (and the accompanying ambiguity), the way you are treated (as a silly child). Perhaps then it might make more sense?;It has been suggested that this is an allusion to a food chain: raven eats worm, worm eats desk.

I had a horrible desire to brag, but it felt so shameless. :-) Also, if I went to my friends and told them I got a 6 they would not really know what was going on.___________""Alice""  is laced with societal metaphors, but multiple direct references to school and formal learning reminds me of Ken Robinson's Ted Talk on How School is Killing Creativity. The Victorian education system, inherited throughout much of the modern World, is probably a theme with which many of us can associate.  The ""dry"" lecture from the mouse places one directly in a classroom situation where (boring/dry) information is given.  Alice's recital of poetry to the caterpillar reinforces that the correct lessons should be done exactly, with little appreciation of the creativity in the ""incorrect"" version. Similarly, the Mock Turtle and the Red and White Queens (in TTLG) compare thier own levels of education with Alice, often with amusing and pun-filled faults. Alice's recitations of school geography and arithmetic while she falls through the rabbit hole in the beginning is equally incorrect, but fun. It is likely, ironically enough, that these punny faults will be picked up by young Victorian children studying these topics quite quickly, preventing them from making future mistakes.    However, despite the  playfully serious  nature  of these direct scenes  (Can anyone talk about  Alice  without using oxymorons?), one cannot help but notice the multiple lessons referenced throughout the text: politics (the teasing of the royal court), mathematics (which will undoubtably be discussed by many other students) and history (the War of the Roses reflected in the painted roses; the bloodthirsty Mary I screams of ""off with his head""). However, these lessons are filled with puns and fun and, more importantly, creativity.  This also reflects the nature of Carroll, himself: on one hand an educated mathematician and logician, and, on the other, the author to the wonderfully creative ""Alice"". The education system, being a vessel for logic and arbitrary seriousness, at the risk of losing creativity, has not changed much over the last century. Carrolls mockery of it still applies today.;Thank you :-);Thank you guys :-) Anon, I actually thought the same thing and worried that I would get less than 4 for that reason.

I find that many of my similarly-educated friends are lovely, but quite boring in the sense that everything I say needs to make sense and be backed up by fact, which is exhausting and terribly uncreative!

I think there also are other strange similarities between Vampires and Christian beliefs (raising from the dead; drinking the blood).

This youngster was curious about all new things and had no idea of the nature of them. She followed to what the wolf said first time, who I think represents the desire, the greed and the sin because the wolf just said nice words to her, the young lady with no experiences. However, little red cap, who was easy to absorb new things and easy to believe stranger's words also very insightful. She recognized that the door standing open (pp. 133), and the unusual features of ""grandmother"" though she had no fear nor solution to react this situation. What's more, she's also a quickly learner for she never making the same mistake at all.  Speaking of grandmother, who was full of love and kind and wisdom, I consider her as the god mother. She seldom said any words but be very nice to little red cap. The mother asked little red cap to bring bread and wine to her grandmother, which indicated that it's a sacrifice to the god mother. What's more, the mother said: Make haste and start before it grows hot, and walk properly and nicely (pp.132) don't forget to say, Good morning, instead of staring about you. (pp. 132) This part is so likely to make a pilgrimage or go to church to pray on Sunday mornings. Though the grandmother was weak in the tale, it didn't mean she's feeble. Her physical body was really weak but the spirit wasn't.

I chuckled when sentences and paragraphs were described as too short. Unfortunately in a society where speech is reduced to sound bites, where texting is a major form of communication and where sentences which are short, concise - and uncomplicated - are praised, practise with writing long complex sentences, which attempt to address nuance and subtlety, while striving to maintain a strong sense of energy, is often lacking. Contradictory reviews add another note of humorous interest when considering the reviews.;I see the tension between extra-natural and technological as two circles with one wrapping the other. I am using the word extra-natural because I want to get away from the connotations of supernatural. The inner circle is the natural world - but with a twist. The twist is the extra-natural world which, while following its own rules, exists outside the natural world. It exists as its own nature which parallels the world of nature as we see it.Surrounding this world as an evolutionary development for a society is the technological world. The technological world of typewriters and phonographs is a sort of layer that overlays the natural world.The emphasis on technology - and by extension science, including the science of the human mind - might be an implicit suggestion that the natural world itself is subject to the examination of science and manipulation of technology. But with the additional piece that while Dracula exists in the extra-natural world where he can change form and influence the winds, that possibly even the extra-natural world can be subject to the scientific mind if only the right tools and thinking is applied. I suggest this because van Helsing's scientific approach implies that science and logic can be used to defeat Dracula - because even though Dracula has powers that exceed the natural universe - that he still has weaknesses and rules. The existence of rules, patterns and needs make the object of study still available to study and control by science. Even the use of religious things can still be part of the scientific approach since the religious things (such as a cross) are still considered to be facts of the natural world.Thinking this out leads me to wonder if part of the subtext of Dracula is a question of what is reality. Is Stoker implying that what we consider reality is probably just one aspect of that reality but that there are more levels and layers of reality? What layers might they be? Both microscopic and cosmological; single cells under the microscope and stars in the telescope. Even atomic theory, the implication of which we do not see with our eyes, but which manifests in the forms of heat energy for nuclear power plants and the explosive material of nuclear bombs. So maybe Stoker is using a literary tool to declare that he believes that reality is much wider and deeper than most people believe.

OUR PEERS' COMMENTS ON FORM FOLLOW: peer 2     This is not an essay. I believe the author is trying to write his/her own version of a fairy tale, which to my knowledge was not the assignment. At least it is creative! peer 3     Well done dear, your languages are well spelt out and your sentences are well constructed. however your argument is a little weak and needs serious improvement, i did not fully understand the idea or message that you tried to pass across, i do not know if it is for my lack of understanding or that the message is not properly conveyed. i hope you will do better in other assignment. peer 4     Creativity is certainly at will. The structure is well, although repetitions could have been avoided. PEERS' COMMENTS ON CONTENT: peer 2     The piece does demonstrate understanding of the fairy tales and remarks on their consequences in modern day society. I cannot really find an argument to evaluate that is related to the text. To my knowledge, the assignment said specifically not to try to remark on modern issues outside of the literary world, but rather to analyze the fairy tales themselves. I don't think I can give this piece a strong score. peer 3     Well there is no strong argument or insights in your essay, i tried to see if there is any moral lesson that i can learn from the write up but could not find any; i suggest that you make more researches on essay writing and improve your self for a better write-up in the near future. peer 4     I didn't see any point to be discussed or analysed. Maybe stating what such comparisons or analogies should be considered, by this way the creative aspect could serve as a guide. THEIR SCORING FOR BOTH FORM AND CONTENT IS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE:  FORM 1 and CONTENT 1. THEIR FINAL COMMENTS FOLLOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST. peer 3     It is a good start up, please if you can improve in the areas i pointed out you will be perfect. peer 4     ;Poulomi, thank you so much for appreciating my response to the assignment and for expressing yourself clearly and concisely. Sometimes in a course like this I feel surrounded by military recruits rather than thoughtful peers, and their quick deification into scholars seems as playful as children acting like soldiers or parents. Some of us take our role-playing far too seriously for we easily forget the bigger game called real life. What I miss in a course like this is not the teacherly thousands but the few students who want to think about what they are learning and apply it to the contemporary world we share. At any rate, Poulomi, thanks for letting me know that at least one peer is thinking outside the boxes.  ;Thank you, Sharon. That psychological experiment should be better known. It is so apt and worrisome. It is  The Lord of the Flies that comes to my mind when I try to understand the intellectual boot camp camaraderie over this assignment. This is not a writing course, but its structure dangerously misleads the drill  sergeants standing over their peers.  Thanks again. Cheers!;Let's not overemphasize grades. Rather what these books and lectures involve should be our focus. Another literary course, The Fiction of Relationship, goes to great lengths to avoid the attitudes expressed so profusely in this course. If you are interested, Professor Arnold Weinstein's guidelines for that course follow: On Peer Assessment and Course Credit To pick up where we left off with the Announcement of yesterday, 14 June 2013, the question was asked:   How do the grades I get on my papers affect my chances at getting credit in the course     whether it   s a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  All Statements of Accomplishment and Statements of Distinction are based on whether you have completed the written assignments in a satisfactory manner.    Satisfactory completion    of the written assignments means that you have scored at least a one (1) on all required written assignments. In other words, you did not score a zero (0) on any assignment. If you do score a zero (0), then the material you submitted has been deemed incomplete by your peers in the course. With an incomplete on one assignment, you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction.  OK. But how do I avoid a zero (0)? What kind of work could be scored a zero (0)?  Incomplete written work     work worthy of a zero (0) No Credit     can take many forms. The submitted essay may be blank; the submitted essay may contain completely unreadable text, or it may have text duplicated again and again to fill the required minimum of words. These papers are primarily what we have in mind when defining what is worthy of a zero (0). Incomplete work may, however, also include essays that are clearly and significantly fewer than the word minimum required by the assignment. So     if you submit only a 5-word, a 50-word or a 200-word response to the 300-word analytical or creative prompt, this would not be sufficient. That paper would be incomplete and worthy of a zero (0).  Please take note of what is not an Incomplete or zero (0).  Incomplete essays are not essays the peer assessor simply disagrees with, or thinks are unintelligent. You are, of course, encouraged to disagree and debate the claims made by your classmates, but do not mark essays with a zero (0) simply because you think the paper is wrong. Instead, use the comments section in peer assessment as an opportunity to vigorously and respectfully debate their claims. That will be more rewarding for you and for the student who submitted the paper. Further, incomplete essays are also not essays that simply have grammatical or formal mistakes (even many, many mistakes). So long as the essay is readable and strives to engage with that week   s reading in what appears to be a sincere and honest way, the paper is worthy of a grade above zero. **Lastly, on this point, we at Brown University are very aware that the student body of this course is very diverse, comprising many native speakers of English but also many non-native speakers who may not have much experience with argumentative writing in English. We ask that all students respect this fact and keep it in mind when peer-reviewing the essays. First and foremost, the goal of our peer assessment system is to help others improve their writing and improve their interpretative ability with literary texts. Those who possess strong skills in these areas have an important role to play in respectfully critiquing the writing of others who want to better their own interpretative abilities in the English language. Yes, you must assign a numerical grade to each paper, but we encourage all peer assessors to concentrate less on the number and more on engaging your classmates with critical comments and helpful feedback in each review.  The real value of peer assessment lies in your willingness to debate and help your classmates explore the substantive ideas of their essays!  So are you saying that I can get the lowest passing score [a one (1)] on all analytical and creative papers, and still receive credit for the course -- a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Yes. You need to score only a one (1) on all required assignments to get a Statement. Of course, in order to fully complete each of these assignments, you must also assess the work of at least three of your peers. Peer assessment is an indispensable part of each paper.  Do all the papers follow the same rubric or scale of grading for peer assessment?  No. The 300-500 word analytical papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-3 with three (3) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 300-500 word creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2 with two (2) being the highest score, and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper. The 1000-1300 final paper will be reviewed on a combination of the above scales with an overall total of five (5) being the highest score and zero (0) the score for an incomplete, no credit (NC) paper.  OK, I know that zero (0) is an incomplete on a peer-graded assignment, but what does a one (1), a two (2) or a three (3) mean?  For an explanation of these numbers on the analytical papers, we refer you to the assignment on Manon Lescaut where their meaning is clearly laid out in the Evaluation/Feedback section on that page. The creative papers are reviewed on a scale of 0-2. There is no grade of three (3) for creative papers. When peer-assessing the creative papers, you will use this criterion. You will be asked the simple question,    Did this paper deepen your understanding of the    Fiction of Relationship    both as it relates to this week   s text and as it exists in the world at large?    If your answer is yes, you award the paper a two (2), and then carefully explain how and why it deepened your understanding. If your answer is no, you award the paper a one (1), and then respectfully explain how and why the paper failed to deepen your understanding of that week   s reading. If the paper is incomplete (see the guidelines set out in points #2 and #3 above), assign the paper a zero (0) for No Credit (NC).   I understand how the 300-500 word creative papers will be graded. But what exactly is a creative paper? How is it different from the analytical paper I am writing this week?  In the analytical papers, we ask you to compose and defend your own argument about the novels    formal qualities, themes and/or structure. We hope you   ll break down or    loosen up    the significance behind particular scenes, characters, or literary elements through your interpretation (the term, analysis coming from the ancient Greek verb,  _  _         _ _, meaning    to unloose, to investigate, to set free, to resolve, to loose from moorings   ). We want you to focus on and closely read precise features of the language used in the stories, and when possible, you should relate their meaning to the larger themes of the course. In the creative papers, by contrast, we ask you to respond to specific language in a prompt based on each text. The goal here, however, is not analysis as such, but synthesis instead--the term, synthesis, coming from the ancient Greek for    a putting together, a joining, a combination or composition of parts so as to form a whole   . What this means, in practical terms, is that you should explore the questions raised by the prompt, not just as they relate to that week   s reading, but also as those questions converge and merge with something outside the limits of our class   s reading list, whether that something is an object, an experience, or a theory you know and think applies to the reading and the prompt.  You have great freedom to choose a focus here. You could, for example, decide to write a philosophical reflection comparing or contrasting the themes of that week's reading to another novel, poem, work of visual or musical art, philosophical approach, religious practice, or scientific theory you know well.  You could also choose to compose a piece of short fiction or poetry for your creative paper. However, if you select this option, we ask that you provide your reviewers with a rationale of approximately 150-200 words, explaining how your poem or piece of fiction is related to the prompt given.  The form your creative paper takes is yours to determine. It is the work of your imagination, but you should make every effort to link it to the week's reading and the language set out in the prompt.  Can you elaborate on what is required for the final paper (1000-1300 words)? Is it different than the analytical and creative papers?  We will explain the final paper in greater detail a few weeks prior to its due date. But for now, let   s ensure we are clear on the expectations for the 300-500 word analytical and creative papers.  OK, can you recap? What do I need to do get credit in this course? Whether I want a Statement of Accomplishment or a Statement of Distinction?  Here   s a summary.  To get a Statement of Accomplishment you must: A. Do the reading over the first six weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: One 300-500 word Analytical Paper One 300-500 word Creative Paper One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Module One, you will assess nine papers. To receive a Statement of Distinction, you must:  A. Do all the reading over twelve weeks, write and then submit on time through the Assignments page: Two 300-500 word Analytical Papers Two 300-500 word Creative Papers One 1000-1300 word Final Paper Late submissions cannot be accepted. B. You must score higher than a zero (0) on all of these submitted assignments. C. Following each assignment you complete, you must assess the work of at least three of your peers before the assessment deadline. This means that over the course of Modules One and Two, you will assess a total of at least fifteen papers.  Finally, if you have further questions about peer assessment, course credit or about any of the written assignments, we encourage to let us know through an appropriate thread on the discussion forum.  ;"

Then I stumbled on to this thread and realized I am not the only one trying to understand it.;""If you accumulate six submissions averaging exactly 2 on Form and Content for each essay and one submission averaging exactly 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.85 and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment.   If, though, five average 2 and two average 1, you will have an average of approximately 1.7 and will not have earned your Statement of Accomplishment."" So if I understand this work expectation correctly, if someone gets a 1 in form and a 1 in content six times and on a seventh essay he or she somehow gets a 1 only in either form or content for a total score of 13 for the 7 essays, he or she will have an average of 1.85 (13/7=1.85). Thus a 1 in form and a 1 in content equal a 2 for grading the essay overall, correct? (And the statistics are calculated as expressed that way, and they are NOT calculated by being separated into each essay's form and content grade individually so that in the example above, the student receiving a total of 13 for 7 essays, his or her total of 13 would be divided by 14 because of the 14 form and content grades, and the result of each being counted separately would have been 0.93 (13/14=0.93). Is the former the correct way to understand your expectation?) This could be more clearly stated by me so it is more easily understood, but I don't want to misunderstand and do think the staff needs to make sure the class understands this correctly so that the anxiety expressed over peer reviews might be mitigated a little.Also, staff, it would be nice to know the statistics on the percentages of 1, 2, and 3 grades being given so that the class can benefit from knowing whether on not Prof. Rabkin's statistical projections for the numbers in the course are on track or not. His stated emphasis on percentages for handing out 1, 2, and 3 grades may have had a chilling effect on peer responses or not. We don't know, and I think, we should know so we can adjust grading accordingly to his guidelines.THANK YOU! GREAT WORK SO FAR!;Thank you, Maria. Perhaps you and Daniel cannot see the problem, but the course work expectations page explicitly states: ""you will have an average of approximately 1.85 (NOT 3.6!) and will earn your Statement of Accomplishment."" ;Thank you again, Paul John, Maria, and Daniel, for your interpretation here and on another thread about grades of  4 being good. You may be right, but do the math as I have done in my original thread:  6 submissions with 2, 1 with a 1, is 13 divided by 7, and equals 1.85 as is expressed on the work expectations page. If I do the math as you and others suggest (Are any of  you on the staff at UM Coursera?), then the result is 6 submissions with 2 on form and 2 on content, and 1 submission with 1 on form and 1 on content and this then equates to  12 2's and 2 1's. This 24 plus 2 equals 26 and  divided by 14 equals 1.85. Either way approximates the same numerical result, as Paul John just realized with his spreadsheet.  Then let's move to the other example: 5 submissions with 2's and 2 with 1's, equals 12 divided by 7, equals 1.7 as is expressed on the course site. Then let's calculate the same example the way you understand it: 5 submissions with 2 on form and 2 on content (or substitute the equivalent 3's and 1's) and 2 with 1's on form and 1's on content. Let's see that seems to be 24 (20 plus 4)  divided by 14 and  voila! 1.7! This is in part what is confusing people  (or worse)  on the  forum about grading: either way the math  nets the same results. Now please try to understand the following.So, is  this course dedicated to  having people complete the assignments from all around the globe with different levels of writing and  English literature backgrounds and getting at least 1 on form and 1 on content (this  would be my assumption) rather than not do the assignments at all or  submitting nonsense and getting a 0 on form or a 0 on content? Or, is this course dedicated to  ensuring  competency in  short thematic essays which seems to be perhaps yours and others interpretation by requiring better than average native skills in English writing and in  literary comprehension?Which is the course's philosophy? There seems to be more at stake here than you  realize, and I hope the staff or Professor Rabkin clarifies what audience he is trying to cultivate with this course: an eager-to-learn, global, student body, or ageless, aspiring English majors?In the meantime, I wish you all the very best, (3's!) for the class and in life.;Never mind, it's useless to continue this discussion for we agree on the math but disagree on the conclusions to draw from the how the same results are calculated. You say a student cannot have a 1 on form and nothing for content. Yet, say, by submitting just one good sentence totally irrelevant to the course assignment, or 320 words of gibberish as imitative content without a modicum of style, that student could be graded 1 only, and his or her average for that one assignment would be 1; and I know you can say that the average for that submission is .5 because you have to count the missing component as a 0, but that is not explicit on the work expectations page, 1/1 averages 1 as does 2/2. The component not completed may or may not be counted for surely the assignments not being done at all are not being figured into the averaging. There is effort expended in submitting gibberish poetry as content as well as effort in lifting a sentence from Shakespeare. Maybe that effort deserves 1/1 or 1/2 or 0. The different ways of understanding the course's philosophy for global grading needs staff clarification. Thanks again for your interpretation.  ;"

I consider peer 4 very harsh. Mainly, when s/he says things like: ""the writing is altogether too confusing and disengaging""; ""there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer's argument"" (I thought rhetorical questions had the power to engage the reader and give the opportunity for reader to make up his/her own ideas about the question); ""Organize your thoughts before you write an essay"" (Are they really so  disorganized?); ""try reading it to yourself, and think if a 3 year old could understand it"" (I think this is hilarious); ""try not to write as you speak, but follow the grammatical rules in writing"" (about such observation, I would say that it is compliment, for  writing  as speaking is the best way to engage a reader. Reading an essay about a tale should be just like the tale was intended to be delivered: spoken.I would appreciate comments on my points above.Here is the essay:What is the meaning  of  life?  Many find none at all. Such a dry perspective is based on the reductionist view that all is matter. Consequently,  one is not able to see beyond the materiality that surrounds oneself. The tale of  Hans in Luck  discusses such a tense binary: meaning-life. Besides, a secondary binary element deals with another tension, which is found in the structures of social life. On one hand we have voluntary association, on the other, familial ties. Indeed, structures that can easily become conflicting. Such a sub-tension will underpin how the character will ultimately decide what is meaningful for himself.   The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what will shape our existence.  Thus, as soon as one thing becomes a burden, it should be discarded. Successively, Hans trades his seven year salary, which is fully materialized into a single piece of gold    as big as his head       would his mind initially set on the shine or worth of wealth?    for horse, then horse for cow, cow for pig, pig for goose, goose for grindstone    apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?    Finally, when near water, he accidently let the grindstone fall in the water; it sinks; it is gone. Surprisingly, instead of desperation for losing his seven year payment    initially shining and finally opaque   , Hans is very glad because he has nothing else that would hinder his journey   s progress; definitely, there are greater values in life than being attached to material things. For Hans, nothing is more precious than arriving at his mother's home; nothing is more valuable than the company of the one he loves and loves him.  Moral lesson: Utility is what we attach to things, but only the inutility of love can give us meaning  in  life.Overall evaluation/feedbackNote: this section can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.To review how to approach evaluating this assignment, please revisit the section on ""Peer Evaluation"" on the ""Work Expectations"" page and two video clips in Unit 00 - Getting Started, ""How to Read for this Course"" and ""How to Write for this Course.""

An ideal response would note one aspect of Form that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Form that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.  peer 1      Very well written essay, clear and precise. Well structure and point put forward in a concise way. Well done!!peer 2      Grammar? good. Words properly used? Yes especially inutility, i thought the use of that word was clever.

Essay consists of the opening statement, main expositive body and conclusion.peer 4      The sentences are mostly grammatically correct. However, the writing seems to be more spoken than written. Also, the words are too fancy and redundant. Also, there are too many rhetorical questions than necessary. In conclusion, the writing is altogether too confusing and disengaging. Therefore, although the ideas are individually good and interesting, they are all over the place when put together.  Please grade the FORM of the essay you have just read on a scale of 1 to 3. FORM here refers to matters of grammar, usage, and structure.  Are the sentences grammatically correct? Are the words properly used? Is the exposition and argument laid out clearly?

Everyone should strive for perfect grammar. However, if someone writes in ways that are particularly vivid or uses particularly incisive key terms to focus the argument or in some other way is outstanding in usage or structure, that essay should be awarded a 3 but no more than 20% of the grades should be a 3 because, by definition, ""outstanding"" is comparatively rare. Most grades should be 2.Score from your peers:  2Please indicate in 30-150 words your judgment of the CONTENT of the essay you have just read. CONTENT here refers to matters of insight, argument, and example.  Does the essay show a deep understanding of some aspect of the work or of a pattern that one can see in the work? Does the argument make sense, feel persuasive, and reveal the significance of the insight or insights? Are there concrete details from the text that support the argument and that we come to understand more powerfully because of the argument? An ideal response would note one aspect of Content that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Content that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.peer 1      The argument of your essay makes completely sense and I entirely agree with it. There were lots of discussions in the forum about this tale and different opinions, but I think you have summarized quite well the real meaning of it.peer 2      Your content is fantastic, you really understand the motives and longings of Hans and his quest to find happiness. I especially loved the sentence at the end of your first paragraph about the sub-tension (ohhhh that lovely word choice) of the relationships Hans has at the beginning of the tale. The way you elegantly placed it at the end of the first paragraph solidifies the thought in my mind as I read the second part. The only thing i would add (and it is a small thing at that) is something about the loss of wealth with each successive trade Hans does (horse is worth more than cow, cow is worth more than pig ect ect)peer 3      Well done story description and argumentation of thoughts. It would be preferably to use some external source for deeper analysis and comparison with other tales.peer 4      ""What is the meaning of life? Many find none at all."" This immediately caught my attention. Also, the writer has written interesting and reasonable insights that I agree upon such as: ""The present tale has a possible important lesson to teach: no matter what we are entitled to own, things are good for a temporary moment; goods are not what can ultimately shape our existence."" However, the supporting examples are too weak and confusing. For example, there are too many rhetorical questions that not only confuses the reader, but also dissuades them from the writer's argument, such as: ""...would his mind initially set on the shine or ""worth"" of wealth?"" and ""apparently, what mindless or meaningless trades!?"" The writing would be much better in content, if the writer simply stated his/her point and given a quote/example from the story.  Please grade the CONTENT of the essay you have just read on a scale of 1 to 3. CONTENT here refers to matters of insight, argument, and example.  Does the essay show a deep understanding of some aspect of the work or of a pattern that one can see in the work? Does the argument make sense, feel persuasive, and reveal the significance of the insight or insights? Are there concrete details from the text that support the argument and that we come to understand more powerfully because of the argument? An ideal response would note one aspect of Content that the writer does well and would profit by continuing and one aspect of Content that the writer would profit by improving in ways you make clear.Since everyone can learn to write better, at least 10% but no more than 30% of the grades should be 1. Most people will offer their readers a new insight and some detailed reference to the text that argues for the significance of that insight and for an appreciation of how that detail functions, so most essays will enrich our reading and earn a 2. Some essays will be astonishingly new or persuasive or useful by making the story much richer and even by helping you understand better how to read stories in general. Such essays earn a 3 in Content, but no more than 20% of the grades should be a 3 because, by definition, ""outstanding"" is comparatively rare. Most grades should be 2.Score from your peers:  2Please write here any other comments which you feel might be of use to you or the writer of this essay.peer 2      not sure what else to say, great essay, keep on writing on.peer 4      Organize your thoughts before you write an essay. Then, try reading it to yourself, and think if a 3 year old could understand it. Also, try not to write as you speak, but follow the grammatical rules in writing. When this is done, you can add on the meat of jotting down direct examples from the story that go along with your points. If you want to go further, try to playing with your words and ""woo"" the reader.                                                  ;HI,Just clarifying and discussing a little further. Probably you don't see a tension between life and meaning, but I do. The tension is life on one side and meaning/full/less on other side. The tension is between two concepts: life and meaning. Also, there is a binary as well when I talk about voluntary association and family ties. According to the American English dictionary binary is ""consisting  of,  indicating,  or  involving  two."" The tension here involved is: will Hans give more value to voluntary association or family ties? Whenever one has to decide between two sides, then there is tension.The point you most disagree is about finding a moral on the tale. Your disagreement is based on a fallacious argument called  argumentum ad auctoritatem, that is, the professor says..., so it has to be like this. Actually, I do not agree with most of the Freudian hermeneutic adopted by professor Rabkin. Indeed, I respect his authority and appreciate very much his thoughtful insight. However, since his reading into the text and not from the text, I might agree or not. I agree that there is no moral to be found in every tale, but we can find in some of them. Barthes said that once the author releases his text, s/he is not the owner of it anymore; the author is dead; the reader can comprehend the text in a total different way. It is up to the reader to find or not if something (moral or no moral) is present in a text.Well. There is more, but it is enough. I believe that such a peer evaluation will be the burdensome of this course. Mainly because it is given too much power for a so diverse group made up of different views and level of education and knowledge about the subject.Best regards,Rosevarte;"

In other words, an expert must understand his subject with such clarity as to be able to explain it in the simplest terms to a layman. Lewis Carroll took his technical understanding a step further     he translated his mathematical knowledge into a story for children, who are laypeople where everything is concerned.  The original story Carroll told the Liddell children (Alice   s Adventures Under Ground) lacked several iconic characters such as the Mad Hatter, March Hare, Cheshire Cat and the pig-baby. They found their way into the published version as mathematical allusions. Stubbornly conservative, Carroll was unhappy with the radical mathematics of his time such as symbolic algebra, projective geometry and imaginary numbers, which he felt were not sufficiently grounded in reality. Alice   s Adventures in Wonderland satirizes these strange ideas in its most famous scenes. The most illuminating example of this is the Mad Tea-Party, where without the crucial element of Time, the three characters (or three terms of a    quaternion   ) rotate endlessly around the tea-table (or a plane). This is a reference to William Hamilton   s Quaternions, which could describe three-dimensional motion instead of motion in a plane.  When a book or story continues to resonate with its readers decades or centuries after it is published, it is often said of it that it contains    universal themes   . People still want to marry into rich families, just as they did in Elizabeth Bennett   s time, and still want legal redress for their problems, as they did when The Merchant of Venice was written. Lewis Carroll on the other hand, resonates with his modern readers not through his depiction of love or jealousy or justice, but because he could transform abstract technical concepts into enchanting characters and vividly ludicrous conversation. That is something no other technical expert has ever done so successfully.""  I would work on the continuity between paragraphs 2 and 3 and work out the connection between the Rutherford quote and what I have said about Carroll following that in paragraph 1 to improve it. I made an oversight and did not quote this video that helped me to write the essay, which should have come under citations:  http://riaus.org.au/events/alice-in-wonderland/Does anybody have any other suggestions?  ;Thank you so much! :);I agree with most of the above posts - science and faith mesh together in an interesting way in Van Helsing's character.   I would like to add that I did notice a few potentially mistaken bits of science. Quincey Morris narrates an anecdote where a horse of his was drained dry of blood in a single night by a vampire bat, which is really impossible. A single bat only consumes 1 fluid ounce of blood during a feeding, and while the wound bleeds for a while due to the anticoagulant in the saliva, that surely isn't enough to kill a horse. And I found it astonishing that Lucy could receive a transfusion of blood from four different people and not develop an adverse reaction. The only explanation is that she had AB +ve blood, which is one of the rarest of all blood types. Dracula was published only 3 years before Karl Landsteiner discovered blood typing, but I was disappointed when Dr. Van Helsing did not even pay lip service to the very likely event that the transfusions themselves might kill her. Surely he must have seen anaphylaxis after transfusions before, being a surgeon and all!  ;"

Everybody has their own idea of what constitutes a good essay which may only be loosely based on the guidelines given in the work requirements. I have always thought that outside references made a work look more ""scholarly"" and well-researched. It means the writer was able to illustrate his idea better with a quote, or spot a connection between someone else's work and the novel in question, so if I were grading your essays I would give you more points for that! Thank you for you kind words :);I especially liked the way you drew a comparison between Dracula and Van Helsing, who are both foreigners, and their opposing roles in the story. What a great essay!  ;I am stunned, this is the second 6 I've got! At the risk of sounding as though I am blowing my own trumpet too much, here is my Dracula essay:  There are many blood-drinking animals in the world, but I believe Dracula goes a long way in illuminating why the vampire alone frightens us so much.   If the vampire simply preyed upon humans the way leeches and bedbugs do, Van Helsing might have simply struck a deal with Dracula to provide him with a steady supply of donated blood. Instead of simply preying on them, the Count converts human into creatures like himself. This might possibly be where the root of our fear of Dracula comes from     his ability to convert rational man into a    lower   , more beastly creature, distorting him and corrupting him.  On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, in Stoker   s lifetime, and polarized attitudes towards the apes, writes Richard Dawkins, in his book The Ancestor   s Tale.    Apes were animals, we were set apart   _ where other animals, such as cats or deer, could be seen as beautiful in their own way, gorillas and other apes, precisely because of their similarity to ourselves, seemed like caricatures, distortions, grotesques.    Dracula, noticeably, has changed so little in his physical appearance, despite the enormous change in his physiology and the physical abilities, he can easily pass for a human. His human origins are still very visible, and brought forcibly home by the way Mina Harker pities Dracula the human being (p.305). Count Dracula is a hellish distortion of a human being, and the characters are in mortal fear that they too shall be distorted by him.   Human beings value many things about our species     our sense of morality, our sense of social obligation to each other, our ability to mature (Dracula   s    child-brain    is contrasted repeatedly with the protagonists       man-brains   ), our ability to die, and our supposed ability to go to Heaven and be with God. Dracula takes each of these values and corrupts them, while still looking, talking and behaving like an ordinary human man, so that the distortion is all the more apparent.   Dracula shows us how much we value these qualities in ourselves, and so gives us a powerful insight into human nature.  One of my peer reviewers mentioned in the comments that they were just about to start reading The Ancestor's Tale, and to them I would say go for it, it's a fantastic book!  ;I usually look for three things in particular:  1. A thesis, or a point towards which the essay is geared.2. This thesis would have to have an element of inference or analysis in it. For example, I would cut points for a thesis like ""Dracula is a scary character."" The writer can maybe use that as a starting point for a discussion about Dracula drinking blood, equating blood with life, and that is why draining the blood, or life, out of someone is scary.  3. Sufficient examples quoted to back up any claims made, or opinions stated. For example, if someone is saying that Mina Harker is a more empowered woman than Lucy Westenra, they must back that up by quoting something from the book, maybe that Mina earns her own living and controls her own income (at least before she marries) whereas Lucy does not work.  I tried to choose these criteria based on the work requirements.  I'm not sure what a ""casual"" essay is. For my part I write the essay as though I am addressing a teacher of mine, with whom I have a friendly relationship and a good rapport - fairly straightforward wording but no slang or abbreviations, and with proper grammar.I hope these criteria are alright; if anyone has an improvement to suggest on these I would be glad to hear it!   ;Professor Rabkin is not the teacher I think of when writing because i don't have a friendly relationship with him :) Being open and vivid is a good idea, I think, but I've seen a few essays that were TOO open and conversational, as though the writer were chatting to you over coffee or something. I think that should be avoided.  ;That's a great criterion: re-reading the book with a new interpretation that changes your understanding of it. I think I will pay more attention to that!  ;"

In his original notes, Stoker called Renfield    Flyman   [1], yet in the novel he disguised the significance of the flies by never stating explicitly why Renfield started to devour them. Thus, when Seward wrote that Renfield was a 'zoophagous maniac' in eating live animals[2], he misunderstood the nature of his patient's deeper intent.Two types of flies can be identified in the book. The first were the common houseflies which Renfield baited with sugar, stored in boxes and ate compulsively. Ingesting these houseflies, symbols of evil, bearers of pestilence and objects of disgust, was believed by Renfield to give him longevity. According to Seward, the eating of flies 'was life, strong life, and gave life to him'. There are obvious parallels here to Dracula with his drinking of blood. When disallowed from eating flies, Renfield ate spiders, and, when forbidden from spiders, sparrows, not because he wanted live flesh, but because the flies were inside them.  More tellingly, the second kind of flies that Renfield consumed were blowflies.   A particularly disturbing scene depicts Renfield eating a blowfly 'bloated with some carrion food'. Blowflies, which usually feed on rotting flesh, are symbols of death stalking a person. A sense of putrefaction is prevalent throughout the novel, such as when Hawker noted that Dracula 'is surrounded by the smell of decay'. Significantly, it was Dracula who had been supplying Renfield with blowflies, the patient confessing near the end of his life that 'he used to send in the flies...great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings'. Dracula, who was able to control Renfield in this way, can therefore be seen as personifying the Lord of the Flies, a translation of the biblical Beelzebub, more commonly known as the Prince of Demons or the Devil [3].  [1] Eighteen-Bisang, R. & Miller, E. (2008)  Bram Stoker's Notes for Dracula,  Jefferson: McFarland p.319[2] The term 'zoophagous', coined in 1835 by W. Kirby in his  On Power of God in Creation of Animals  (p.70), means animal eater. It fell out of use in 1840 when it was felt 'carnivore' was more suitable. Stoker resurrected the word to invent his disorder for Renfield. Today, 'zoophagia' is used to describe stage two of a psychological disorder called clinical vampirism, also know as 'Renfield's Syndrome'.[3] Jeffrey, D.L. (ed.)

I guess this shows we should take the grade with a pinch of salt.-----The police presence in 'The Tell-Tale Heart' and 'The Black Cat' was crucial to the psychological states of both protagonists and to the stories' endings. Poe's use of the police brought a new element to fantasy as he was one of the first writers to give them a role in fiction[1].In 'The Tell-Tale Heart', Poe depicted three policemen sitting around cheerfully whilst the murderer had a mental breakdown brought on by what he thought were their 'hypocritical smiles'. Initially he had believed 'my  manner  had convinced them' that nothing was amiss. However, the longer the police stayed, the more anxious he became: 'They heard! - they suspected! - they  knew!'. Thus, even though the police were unaware that a crime had been committed, his paranoia made him admit his guilt. This reaction is significant in that it showed for the first time in fiction what a person's reaction could be when confronted by the idea of this newly established body of authority[2].In 'The Black Cat' the police played a similar role as, even though they partook in a 'rigorous investigation' of the premises, the murderer felt secure that his crime would go undetected. He related that 'their assurance of my guiltlessness' meant that they suspected nothing. This false sense of bravado proved his undoing. Again, the presence of the police was key to the story. After the black cat's scream, Poe gave his only physical description of the police, writing of 'a dozen stout arms toiling' to knock down the wall, implying the firmness of this new force.Without the police, both stories would have had incomplete endings. Poe's inclusion of the police brought a new dimension to fiction in that their arrival could bring closure to a story. In doing so, the police became an obvious symbol of authority. For the reader, this also had the significant effect of creating a greater consciousness of what it meant to be policed.[1] Poe was also responsible for what is considered to be the first detective story, 'The Murders on the Rue Morgue' (1841). See Flanders, J. (2011)  The Invention of Murder  p.294[2] Both these stories were written in Philadelphia and were published in 1843. However, the police in Philadelphia were established in 1845. It seems he may have been influenced by a stay in Richmond, Virginia where a police force had been established some years earlier.

Reading the stories I realised I had read most of them as a child, but like your daughter, I never saw anything dark in them the first time around. Reading them again now, years later, with the specific intent of reading for hidden meanings and symbolism I see a very dark side to the stories that I never picked up on as a child. So my ""shock"", was actually surprise that I didn't  ""see"" any of this darkness the first time around. Oh to be an innocent child again.Offended? No. This realisation led me to questions such as: what type of lives did people live that led them to make up these stories? In what context did parents tell their children these stories? What can we learn about life back them from reading these stories? Were they insignificant, incidental stories,  or a major part of child rearing practices back in the day?So my advice, don't stare at the darkness but become a detective!

One peer gave me 1s on the accusation that my essay was plagiarised!   Here is the comment:peer 3      This is a perfect essay. Given the reference cited below, it seems likely that the author simply copied the essay from the reference. I wish I could think otherwise but I cannot. Awarding ones on this basis.While I am flattered that the person believes my essay is 'perfect' (I wouldn't agree here), I am quite offended about this accusation as it has no basis.   If it helps contextually, I am a high school English teacher; I would hope that my writing of essays is in some way effective.   I will copy and paste my essay for reference.   By the way, the works cited reference was for my Hemingway quote.My plea is this: please assess peers on the basis of what you see, not conjecture.   Students on this course put a lot of time into reading, thinking and writing essays so it is only fair that the same level of consideration be given when you are assessing a work as well.My essay:                 Grimm   s fairytales give us greater insight into human behavior and choices.   Despite the profusion of fantastical elements, such as animorphism, personification of the natural world, magic, and so on, the reader easily suspends disbelief by empathizing with characters.   We can immediately relate to the desires of the characters, and wring our hands at their misfortune brought on by poor decisions.   This suspension of disbelief and empathy is created in spite of the potent natural symbolism and fantastic elements, which in turn creates the timelessness and universal appeal of the stories.    The desires of the characters are the most striking feature and immediately create empathy.   Humble desires and actions help us respect people like the fisherman, as opposed to the insatiable greed of his wife in    The Fisherman and his Wife   .   The cheeky mischief of Tom Thumb makes us laugh, while the broken promises and betrayals (   Cat and Mouse in Partnership   ,    How Mrs Fox Married Again   ) make us cringe and acknowledge unethical actions.   Universal understandings of ethical behaviour are what help give these stories their timeless and universal appeal.  Natural symbolism is another prominent feature that immediately helps us relate to key meanings in the text.   Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.  Hemingway once remarked,    All good books have one thing in common     they are truer than if they had really happened.      This is especially true in the case of these fairytales.

I hate Tom and Jerry personally because to me it is a series of rather violent but completely meaningless and mindless actions. It's gratuitous violence at its best, even if it is a cartoon and even if it's meant to be funny, it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. However I have no issue with the Grimm tales, or Dracula or Poe or any of the other works we are going to study.  There is violence in quite a lot of fantasy and science fiction stories, but it's important to consider why that violence is there in the first place. All the works we are studying are not mindless slasher novels but absolute literary classics that have withstood the test of time - therefore there has to be value in the violence within them.  Fantasy and Science Fiction often simply holds up a mirror to our society, and in showing us these alternate worlds it tells us a lot about the way things are in our world. At the time of the Brothers Grimm violence and extreme corporal punishments were very much a part of life. Even now, we live in a society that contains a significant amount of violence, and so it's only natural that this violence is reflected in works of arts and in literature.If the violence offends the OP or anyone else then that is probably a good place to start the analysis of the piece. We have the freedom to analyse any of these pieces on the grounds that we choose and what better place to start than with something to which you have a strong reaction to. What role does the violence play in the story? Why is it there? What does it tell us about the character, the authors, what does it tell us about society at the time, or even now? All the writers we are studying are literary masters and there will have been a reason for them inserting violence into their stories. Before dismissing any of these stories for their violence surely we first need to understand why it's there in the first place.   (by the way, I haven't read all the way to the bottom of the thread, I wanted to comment on this particular bit - sorry if this has all already been said below!);I'm doing my essay on another topic and since we can only submit one short essay I won't get the chance to discuss this so I thought I'd mention it here.  When Alice encounters the Red King sleeping, Tweedledee tells her he is dreaming of her. This reminded me of  Zhuangzi's question: ""Am I a man dreaming he is a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he is a man?"" after waking up from a vivid dream where he was a butterfly and was not aware of himself as a man.  Having the Red King asleep and dreaming of Alice in the Looking Glass world begs the question: is Alice dreaming of herself in Looking Glass world meeting the sleeping Red King, or is the Red King dreaming of Alice dreaming of being in Looking Glass world? In which case when she wakes up is it truly reality or still an extension of the Red King's dream?  Or are they like two mirrors face to face: Alice dreams of being in Looking Glass world meeting the Red King who's dreaming of Alice dreaming she is in   Looking Glass world   meeting the Red King....ad infinitum.  ;"

I don't think your essay deserved the low score you say it received as I enjoyed it, but I know it's a bit frustrating when you don't have constructive feedback on what to improve so here's my two cents, hope it helps.I agree with your point for the second part or so of the novel, but in the first part the reader gets to read all the journals, letters etc, before the characters think about pooling them together. That is in part what creates such suspense because we already understand what is happening before the characters really get a grasp on the situation. That's my opinion anyway. Then as you say the characters then start to pool their writings together, they become very aware that all they write will be read (which as you say is quite ironic), and of the importance of learning from the records they create.  I think there might be a bit of lack of structure in your essay, it probably would have help to have a concluding paragraph or sentence to help tighten it all up. There is something about your essay that for me doesn't flow as well as it could, but I'm sorry I'm struggling to put my finger on what that is. I think it might be the need for a little more structure. Maybe someone will have better feedback on this than me.  I also found your second paragraph a bit disconnected from the rest of the essay which made it a bit confusing. I think if you took out that paragraph and maybe added a final concluding paragraph instead it would have worked a little better.  Hope this helps!;Hi Kasey,  I agree with Laurie's feedback. You start with a thesis about science vs superstition and throughout your essay you focus more on a Van Helsing = science + superstition idea. I think all you needed to do is to add in your introductory paragraph that the way Stoker illustrates his point about science vs superstition is to have Van Helsing representing the mix of the two.   I also think saying that Van Helsing knows that more than science is needed because he represents that bridge is maybe a little easy. He starts by using science but science fails him and so he turns to the darker and more powerful superstitions, as well as the religious iconography etc. In which case is he the bridge or does he represent a contrast between the two?With regards to form Laurie's done a great job there, so I won't go over what she said already. It's well written overall but there are a few things here and there that you could tighten which as Laurie points out would also probably reduce your word count. For example: "" In the end, it is not science that defeats Dracua, rather it is the religious iconography and superstitious practices that bring him down"" feels little clumsy to me. You could say ""In the end, it is not science but religious iconography and superstitious practices that defeat Dracula"". That way you avoid the repetition in your original sentence.  Hope this helps!  ;Hi Florencia,  I just wanted to add a quick comment. I really like your idea that once Dracula's nature is understood and once his location is known he effectively loses his power and is defeated. That said, although your introduction and conclusion deal with this specifically, your middle two paragraphs deal with knowledge but in a different context. Maybe that's why two of your peers didn't find your thesis clear.  For me your essay makes a number of different points, all interesting but not all following the same thesis. The introductory and concluding paragraph deal with one thesis as I mention above. However, the second paragraph is pretty disconnected dealing with how much characters reveal to each other, whilst the third deals with the idea of class vs knowledge, science and superstition. Another very interesting point, and one that hadn't occurred to me - in fact I wish I'd read an essay on that now, it would have been very interesting. I think if you had just focused on the class vs superstition point, or just on the fact that Dracula's power resides in the unknown and mysterious it would have been a big 3 from me.  Hope this helps!  ;Here's my essay. I got some lovely feedback - thank you very much to all my peers - but I'd also love to hear what needs improving, or if there's anything lacking in my essay. Any criticisms welcome!  There is strong Christian imagery throughout Dracula, with Christian symbols and faith used as a defense and weapon against the vampires. However, Stocker also subverts Christian concepts such as the Eucharist for example, in having Mina forced to drink Dracula   s blood to    commune    with him. Renfield plays a particular role in perverting Christian ideas by making a God, or anti-God of Dracula.Just as John the Baptist announced the arrival of Christ, so Renfield announces the arrival of his master, paving the way for supreme being. In preparation, Renfield forgoes his comparatively frivolous and insignificant hobby - the flies and the spiders - instead swearing faithfulness to the higher power of Dracula. This is reminiscent of the preparation that a priest or monk might go through before taking orders. Renfield in effect becomes a disciple of Dracula, and Seward himself observes his patient is taken over by a religious mania.  There are also clues in Renfield   s speech. He refers to Dracula using the    He    and    His    customary when referring to God. He further likens himself to Enoch who in the Bible is said to have    walked with God: and he was not; for God took him"", (Genesis 5:22-29). By doing this, Renfield likens Dracula to God and expresses his wish to be taken as Enoch was.Stoker uses the idea that Dracula is an anti-God or anti-Christ to add an unfinished note to the story. If Dracula is an anti-Christ there is a suggestion that he might resurrect and in fact, Mina (and therefore her unborn child) still has his blood inside her meaning that part of him lives on.

You're completely right in saying that I shouldn't attribute anything to Stocker's intention, as you say anything we come up with in our analysis is just conjecture.  And also I agree with you and peer 2 my final point about Mina was flawed, that needs correcting.  Thanks again for the feedback Florencia, really helps to have things to look out for in future essays.  ;I really like the idea of Dracula representing a invasion by the continent, it's something that I hadn't thought of when I read it so that's definitely made me think about it in a different way! It's very similar to the parallel you draw with the idea of Irish Independence, since Dracula could then be seen to represent invasive England, so the two points work well together. And of course the sexual imagery is very strong throughout the book so all very valid points.  I have to admit though that I agree with peers 2 and 3, it would work   better to focus on one particular theme and really explore it. Personally I would have loved to hear more about your first / third idea which I find really interesting. Although a very valid point, your second point is quite disconnected from the other two and with the limit we have on word count it means you can't really delve deep into any of your ideas. I think consolidating points 1 and 3 together and drawing out examples from the book would have been a really interesting essay from a different view point.  Or of course an essay focused on sexual imagery in Dracula would also work great since there is so much material to talk about, especially that scene where one of the female vampires almost starts to drink Harker's blood and Dracula stops her. In my opinion the most sexually charged scene in the whole book!You've definitely enriched my reading though so overall well done!;Here's my essay too.

The thread is here:  https://class.coursera.org/fantasysf-003/forum/thread?thread_id=533Hope you're feeling better after your hospital trip!  ;I'm going to sound like a bit of a moron here, but in Hong Kong where I live there was a bank holiday on Monday so when I got back from work last night (Tuesday, it's now Wednesday morning here) I thought it was Monday night and forgot to submit my essay. I just woke up and realised what day it is and that I'd missed the deadline.*slaps forehead*The worst thing is that the essay was all written out and ready to go, I   had it saved on my hard drive but for some reason hadn't submitted it early, a mistake I shall not make again. I thought I'd use the forum instead for grading and start the post your essay thread early. I actually find the grading process really helpful - I've learnt quite a lot from it so far - so I'm keen to provide feedback for anyone that wants it. I've also posted my essay below, if anyone has any feedback. Thanks!!Shelley   s original subtitle for Frankenstein was    The Modern Prometheus   . In Greek mythology Prometheus stole fire from the gods to bestow it upon man and faced eternal punishment as a consequence. This is very similar to the Fall of Man where Adam and Eve are punished for taking knowledge from God, and indeed Frankenstein can be seen to represent a second Fall as a consequence of scientific progress going too far.   Frankenstein reaches for forbidden knowledge, that of bestowing life which is the power of a god and which is reminiscent of the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. His punishment for acquiring this power is to be persecuted by his creation for the rest of his life. Frankenstein is aware of his fall, saying    the apple was already eaten, and the angel   s arm bared to drive me from all hope    - the hope of returning to his own version of Eden. The creature experiences his own version of The Fall when he is rejected by his creator, just as Adam was cast out of Eden. When the creature tries to reach for human companionship he becomes ashamed of the horror of his appearance and Adam and Eve become ashamed of their nakedness. The creature also becomes aware of his Fall when he reads Milton   s Paradise Lost, referring to Adam   s supplication to his creator and wishing for his own Eve to share his sorrows.   Frankenstein and the creature can therefore be seen as two sides of the same coin and indeed it isn   t coincidental that the creature is nowadays often referred to as Frankenstein. Together they represent mankind: they have both fallen and are fated to cause each other immeasurable pain until they destroy each other. The story can be seen as a warning that mankind will fall again if science is allowed to go too far, and man will in the end be the cause and instigator of his own demise.  ;"

After all, what we remembered from our childhood is beautiful girls with beautiful clothes, parties with sweet cakes, charming princes, birds and cats that can talk, and so on. I once tried to read again many fairy tales when I was a grown up, and I was shocked. I guess maybe we only learn to value life when we are adults in a modern society. We value it so much that many people now oppose the death penalty. Children, on the other hand, can be cruel sometimes. And in old times, people also didn't value life as much as we do now. One can get handed just because of stealing! It is unimaginable today.But anyway, people die all the time in novels and TV shows. I love Holmes, Poirot, CSI, Criminal Minds, Bones, etc. And there are so many dead bodies in there. But I am enjoying these stories and shows.

I am a pacifist at heart, but I also have studied enough history to know that the humankind has used violence to fight off any peoples they consider to be ""others"".   The Inquisition, the Crusades, the European colonization of the Western hemisphere, Asia and Africa, the Jewish Holocaust, and African slave trade  were all brutal periods in human history.   Unfortunately, violence continues in  more recent times even in the so-called ""more civilized"" Western civilizations.   Examples, such as the CIA  supported tortures and murders in Latin America during the 1970s and  80s (e.g., ""los desaparecidos"".   Unfortunately, the ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" philosophy still permeates through much of the world.It  is not surprising to me that these fairly tales as oral history reflect their times and continue to resonate in modern times.   Isn't capital punishment/the death penalty still in effect in most parts of this country?   And, what about television and movies, and more importantly for our future, video games?   Isn't violence rampant throughout these media?So, the fact that fairy tales have violence is not shocking to me.   Unfortunately, the human race has not evolved beyond the use of force and violence to accomplish its goals.Fairy tales can serve as a reminder that we have to look deep and hard to uncover the ways in which we continue to glorify and justify violence from generation to generation.;Hello,I reviewed five students essays; however, I have not received any reviews of my essay.

So while I understand most of the  references  in the books, I can see while some of it may confuse someone who has never been exposed to British culture. Things that are second nature to a British reader such as afternoon tea, the references to  royalty   or the croquet game, may have the average American reader have to pause and think them through which I personally think makes the flow of the book a bit choppy since it is already a little scattered sometimes. Plus I find that most Americans are exposed to the Disney cartoon version early in life and never actually read the book until high school or later (if ever). Not sure when most British students are exposed to Alice, or how popular the ""Americanized"" movie version is in England, but I think this changes our  perception  of it as well.;I think the books are much more that of a young child's imagination and the way they see the world and not so psychedelic drug like.

What has changed ... ?I think, in the past 100 years, the most powerful force we have encountered is the advancement of knowledge in its infinitely various and expanding forms: science, technology, communications, and ect. Societies throughout history have always experienced change, yet our modern society experiences such an accelerated rate of change that I do not think we can truly comprehend how radically different our present world is in comparison to that of the not-so-distant past. Some time ago, I was listening to one of the Teaching Company's Great Courses on Medieval history. One thing the instructor tried to illustrate was the exceedingly slow pace of life, particularly for the rural peasant, and how slowly the entire culture changed over generations. Triggering events such as war, starvation, or plague often acted as catalysts for immediate change. Today, we might blame the stock market for causing job loss, or praise advancements in science for revolutionizing the way in which we stay in touch with each other (as in our iPads, or this MOOC). We are so accustomed to change that we are no longer alarmed by it.  I absolutely love the opening scenes where we meet Jonathan Harker on his cross-country trip to Castle Dracula. There is such an innocence in his observations; he is seeing the world for the first time. As I recall, the Victorian age was one of expansion, with Great Britain involving herself in the affairs of China, India, and Africa. America herself was on the advent of the Spanish-American War; the transcontinental railroad had been completed, her Native Americans re-settled into Reservations, and the West, closed. This was also the the era of the great explorers. ""King Solomon's Mines"" heralded in a popular fascination with adventure, and the world would remain fascinated with adventure as the automobile and the airplane came into play.  I think, in many ways, these years before The Great War (WWI) were the end of an age of innocence.  Perhaps this is what changed, our innocence. We discovered everything worthy of discovery, we conquered everyone worthy of conquering, and we did it in the name of the betterment of society. Bram Stoker wrote against this historical backdrop, and it seems to me that his timing in publishing a book that struggles with the loss of innocence as very serendipitous. And as for today? Why are monsters featured as saviors for us mortals? I don't know. I learned the other day, through my job, that there are a dozen venues in our city offering certain illicit services. My place of employment has been fighting against certain other types of semi-illegal businesses from entering our city - but all that we fight for today could be made legal by the courts tomorrow. Why do we fight at all? There is such a great yearning in our traditional American culture for right and justice, but no one seems to be able to agree on just what that is anymore. It's saddening, really. I no longer think the monsters in our movies are scary when the real world can be so much more terrifying. Perhaps, for all our great knowledge, what we have lost is wisdom. What dark mirror do our ninety-minute flicks reflect back to us? Perhaps it is we who have become the monsters.  ;I had to put it down because of work, so I'm still reading it, but in the middle of the week I lost patience and found a few minutes to flip through and skim ahead! (I know, it's a terrible approach to a course focusing on close reading!) After having a few days away from it now, I find there are certain patterns that have come to light while thinking about it. Such as, the interplay of light/dark, day/night, mental stability/insanity, life/death, burial/birth, old age/youth, tradition/modernization, and so on. In fact, the more I think about it, the more elements come into play. Stoker really packed a lot into the complex web of characters and relationships he's created. This is definitely a book I want to read again!  ;You asked a good question: ""should I write about what I think or what peers want to read?"" These replies are great; they're focusing on structure and approach, and offer a lot of good advice. I'd like to address another aspect to your question that also may help. This is a two-fold answer, so hang onto your perspective ...First, it was emphasized in the introductory video that our readers are our fellow peers. Based on this recommendation, then yes, you should follow the advice of your peers and gear your essays toward benefitting the enlightenment of the intelligent, thoughtful student in regards to the topic, material, and approach of your essays. This, ideally, will help your essay in earning their commendation, and at the least, their counsel.  On the other hand, my experience as a writer, coupled with the research I've done concerning the publishing world (not academia), has shown me that when I write, the first person I need to write for is myself. I am my first reader. While I am skilled enough to write what other people would have me to write (specifically, business correspondences for my job), which I do well, I prefer writing for myself. When I write for myself, I find I take more time investing myself into my projects, and that the results have more impact on others, than if I had created some imaginary reader to write for whom I had never met.    Besides, one of the faults of choosing to write on a particular topic for the publishing world by basing the choice of topic on what's selling today is that, by the time your material hits the press, your topic is already out of date - especially if the average shelf life for new publications is only 3 months (I forget the source on that). Large publishing houses sort out what they are going to publish by way of using a heavily researched marketing questionnaire. (The first Harry Potter book hit something like three-fourths of their targets, which is why they pushed it so aggressively when it was released, offering alongside it books in a similar vein. This strategy is the same as grocery store selling candy and T.V. Guide at the checkout stand.)  Are you reading what you read last year? Not at all. And neither is anyone else.We have here perhaps 1,000 students. That's 1,000 possible different perspective on what constitutes a good, well-written and persuasive essay on such-and-such topic. The odds are that the majority of us (who are supposedly upper-level undergraduate English Majors) will share a common, well-educated background in the literary arts and therefore able to offer constructive criticism to the shared aim of bettering ourselves together throughout these units. However, then there are those of us here (myself included) who have little to no ""formal"" education in English, so our comments may not always be as academically sound or as productive as those who have been studying English for three or four years.  Basically, write what moves you. By all means, consider the suggestions you've received and apply the skills you are learning in the academic setting, but don't forget that you are the primary recipient of your efforts in everything you do. If you choose to write on a topic that has challenged you, inspired you, or moved you in some way, you will be better able to express yourself more powerfully on the page, and  we - your readers - will be moved. Writing well is more than technique - it's art. Even in academia.;"

Most people learn best through a combination of the three types of learning styles, but everybody is different.  Auditory Learners: HearAuditory learners would rather listen to things being explained than read about them. Reciting information out loud and having music in the background may be a common study method. Other noises may become a distraction resulting in a need for a relatively quiet place.  Visual Learners: SeeVisual learners learn best by looking at graphics, watching a demonstration, or reading. For them, it's easy to look at charts and graphs, but they may have difficulty focusing while listening to an explanation.  Kinesthetic Learners: TouchKinesthetic learners process information best through a ""hands-on"" experience. Actually doing an activity can be the easiest way for them to learn. Sitting still while studying may be difficult, but writing things down makes it easier to understand.  Types of Learning Styles: What Everybody Should KnowAlthough most people use a combination of the three learning styles, they usually have a clear preference for one. Knowing and understanding the types of learning styles is important for students of any age. It is advantageous for students to understand their type of learning style early on so that homework and learning may become easier and less stressful in the future. Although it may be tempting to stick with what works, it's important to practice and train the other types of learning styles early on so that, as he grows, the child can utilize the other types just as effectively.

Given that much space, I think it would be very difficult to properly explain the relevant historical context to a novel, which may be why they are limited only to ""literary"" matters (which, I agree, can be a broader category, but the assignment specifically asks for ""plot, style, theme, structure, imagery, allusion, narrator reliability, and so on"").

I take  Aesop's fables as an example as it was the first reading assignment.

Trees provide spiritual guidance (   The Almond Tree   ) and protection (   Fred and Kate   ).   Apples, with their biblical connotative meanings of both knowledge and danger, are a common motif (   The Golden Bird   ,    Snow White).   Gold also brings salvation to the poor, but also leads the greedy down the path of avarice (   The Golden Goose   ).   All such symbols are immediately recognizable for children everywhere, and the imbuement of magical or special properties in these seemingly common things engages our fascination and attention, helping us to look thoughtfully at the world and our place within it.""Please note that I have no disregard for this wonderful analysis. However, as somebody keen on getting his creative juices flowing to develop ideas and concepts better, as per my understanding, one would be better off not breaking everything down intellectually to this level. I do not believe writers critically break down associations and meanings held by objects and people, but do this in a more intuitive   way. Thus, creative writing, like music and art, is about what feels right and not what looks analytically and thematically accurate. I understand that snakes symbolically represent deceit, betrayal and slyness. I could see that in Adam and Eve's story, and could see that in Harry Potter as well. I would not sit and analyse the thematic unity in character traits of snakes before I get one to star in my books. I would be aware of this intuitively.My question is, in order to write creatively - is this not something to be understood and appreciated in an under the radar sense? As readers, the reason why books wow us is in their ideas, the motion, the stillness, the concepts and the beauty. Creative beauty, in my opinion, does not come through hard analysis, formulas, associations and dissection, but through letting one's imagination fly and feeling the beauty of ideas and concepts take over oneself.  How exactly then does critically analysing works to this depth help?;That's a beautiful answer! Thanks for sharing your insight!  I have a fear though. I fear that I will not be able to see the quilt as complete, as I used to before critically reading it. Would that make me lose sight of the sense of beauty and awe I find in a piece of work? Would deconstructing something to it's bare components make me lose the 'feel' of the story?  I think (and this is just a personal opinion and may be flawed) that to recreate magic in my writings, I need to keep my finger on the pulse of the what made the story awesome. By critically reading the story, and breaking it down into sub components, I would be able to see how the story is structured, how the author put certain events in a certain order to keep the reader guessing etc. This does help me understand ideas behind these areas as well. I feel I would however, lose track of what I loved about the story and the feeling I experienced. Ultimately, when writing a story, I often aim to recreate the kind of magic I felt while reading the other texts I have read. I feel that if I lose sight of what made those stories special, I will not be able to recreate that magic.Is there a recommended way in which authors should analyse stories? Should they do this critically? Or should they stick to the feel? I am not sure, but I do want to build better habits to write better stories! What do you think?;Loved your answer, and I connect to your thoughts very well.Thank you! That helps.;I agree. I often tend to wonder whether there is any intrinsic value to the deep intellectual analysis that works are put under. Those writings weren't made for this, and the analysis leads to naught. The purpose of the writings was to raise questions, not think about Mary Shelley and how her meeting with her husband shaped her decision to write about Frankenstein.As somebody who wishes to get into writing, I think it's a good idea to stop analyzing (or berating oneself at the dearth of intellectual output), and start writing.

In the Victorian Era it is improper to talk about sexual encounters, even straight sex. So we get an allegorical account of what happened.   Mr. Harker opens the with person after person telling him that he should turn back, saying what he is trying to do is wrong, waving signs to ward off evil spirits and crossing themselves, yet he continues on.   He hears the words: satan, devil, werewolf, witch, vampire and all sorts of admonishing and still continues on, even going through fire. He literally goes through hell, fire and damnation to get to the door of Castle Dracula and everything in him is urging him to turn back but still willingly enters when asked. This sounds, to me, like folks trying to talk someone out of choosing an alternate lifestyle, even a temporary one or going into a den of iniquity.  Once he accepts the invitation, he and the vampire get to know each other. As they become more intimate, Jonathan feigns innocence (as virgins do) and is apprehensive about proceeding but it   s too late. The trio of women are but another extension of Dracula   s psyche, performing unmentionable or unnatural acts. Men providing nourishment or being nursed on or being penetrated is considered emasculating acts or role reversal.  This new world is very scary and so are the new feelings. Jonathan is ashamed to be excited by what is considered an abomination that is, somehow, sexy.  He wants out but by this time Dracula is falling for him and tries to force him to stay. There's even a mention of Love. Jonathan  decides that his existence is not what he wants and escapes and then covers his deed with a hasty marriage.   They move on with their lives but his experience is a constant presence in their relationship. Maybe he   s living in the closet or    living on the down low,    as they say. Finally, his desires manifest itself in their bedroom and affects Mina negatively. Dracula   s escape on the Czarina Catherine vessel, while possessing Mina.     This ship is named for a woman known for her promiscuity or as a nymphomaniac. Mina trials could even represent an STD due to Jonathan's indescretions, some of which can cause infertility.  Jonathan then decides that he can no longer run from who he is and what he did and goes to the root of the problem to cut if off or behead it.

There isn't a whole lot of text devoted to him in ""The Birthmark,"" but what is there speaks volumes. Hawthorne describes Aminadab as ""a man of low stature, but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was grimed with the vapors of the furnace"" (26). He is actually a little creepy, if not vaguely sinister. We learn that he isn't capable of understanding the science behind Aylmer's work, but that he can execute all the physical details easily. And then, of course, we have the very direct line: With his vast strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the indescribable earthiness that incrusted him, [Aminadab] seemed to represent man's physical nature; while Aylmer's slender figure, and pale, intellectual face, were no less apt a type of the spiritual element. (26)That's our first tip-off that we're dealing with a symbol here. Aminadab symbolizes man's earthly, physical half; Aylmer symbolizes man's lofty, spiritual half. Our second tip-off is his name. ""Aminadab"" is the name of a high priest in the Bible, so it's not a stretch to think that Hawthorne's character is also meant to symbolize men of religion, in contrast to Aylmer, who symbolizes men of science. The first thing we notice is that the man of religion is, in this story, subordinate to the man of science (Aminadab is Aylmer's servant). This isn't a value judgment on Hawthorne's part; rather an observation of the times in which he is living. See both ""In a Nutshell"" and ""Setting,"" where we discuss the ideological environment of ""The Birthmark"" and of Hawthorne's own time. You'll see that science was on the rise as compared to religion.At first, it's hard to reconcile the fact that Hawthorne equates science with loftiness/spirituality (in Aylmer's character) and religion with earthiness/physicality (in Aminadab's character). We would expect the opposite: the spiritual man is the religious man, while the earth-bound man is science-driven. But this is not the case. We can understand these associations by recognizing that Hawthorne is interested in a particular kind of scientific inquiry     the kind that, perhaps in Hawthorne's opinion blasphemously, is built upon man's spiritual aspirations to conquer nature and become like God. Aylmer isn't exactly experimenting with pea plants here; he's trying to remove the symbol of man's inherent flawed spirit. That's why science = spiritual.Notice that Aminadab, unlike Aylmer, has no such aspirations. ""If she were my wife,"" Aminadab says, in his only line of dialogue, ""I'd never part with that birthmark"" (28). This is the first time we can sense that Aminadab knows something Aylmer doesn't. He may not be able to follow Aylmer's science, but when it comes to wisdom, he just might have the edge. To the man of science, becoming God is a lofty and noble goal. But to Aminadab, it is blasphemous, impossible, and certainly unwise to try.The last thing to talk about here is that laugh at the end of the text. When it becomes apparent that the birthmark is fading from Georgiana's cheek, Aylmer hears ""a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant Aminadab's expression of delight"" (85). We hear nothing more from the Aminadab until Georgiana dies; then ""a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again!"" (91). We see that religion has triumphed over science in that Hawthorne's tale has proved the foolishness of trying to become God; religion, despite having been made into a servant by science, has the last laugh     literally.But the reader can't safely take Aminadab's side here; in one sense, we're right back to where we started with that slightly sinister tinge to his character. He laughs at Georgiana's death. In this way, Hawthorne complicates his story considerably. He's certainly questioning the wisdom of letting scientific inquiry drive our entire ideology; but he's certainly not so positive about religion, either.http://www.shmoop.com/birthmark/aminadab.html;"

So it would be ""flight of death"", which makes even more sense!  ;When I think of the death-eaters and that he sought the death wand and its power over other people's lives, I believe that he was a ""flight of death."" I think you are forgetting that immortality to Tom Riddle was a means to an end - namely an undead dictator who led by fear, not love. His image was meant to be terrible and not necessarily convey his desire for immortality, because in a way, he already had it. This is actually more similar to Dracula. Both had immortality and had to be whittled down first before destruction.Remember, that immortality is something Tom Riddle already had by the time he took the name Voldemort.  ;Excellent point. If I could revise my earlier assessment, I would say that Voldemort both feared death and wished to wield it as weapon. His earlier focus on horcruxes was replaced before the final battle with his search for the death wand. What was his motivation for this search? Because in so wielding, he would be immortal? Perhaps he believed that, but as we know from the story, all three brothers died because of their gifts. I am now wondering if his violent actions were intended to create a kind of horrific immortality upon the minds of muggles and magic-born alike.I feel like I need to re-read Riddle's earlier life in The Half-Blood Prince again. I just remember so much of the last book, but perhaps there are deeper motivations I neglected. I still think of Tom as that crying baby who inflicted his pain on others, very similar to Hitler, Napoleon and other similar ambitious world dictators.;A final point is that there is no immortality of physical form, even for the gods. Destruction can always occur as in the case of Dracula and Voldemort. Immortality is a dream with so many caveats so as to not be in itself immortality. Being perpetuated in history or converted to another form is a type of immortality, but not in keeping with the dream as I understand it.Is immortality the same as invincibility? After all, even those who are invincible may be subject to forces outside of human control, such as time or gravity.;Although I though Dracula overlong, the sexual puns, suggestions that both Arthur and Jonathan were cockolds, and the ridiculous justifications of what it means to be male or female has me in stitches.Throughout the entire time, I was wondering if this was merely a modernist view of Dracula and NOT what a contemporary Victorian audience would have seen.Two incidents of particular were of note to me. When Nina is walking back with Lucy, she makes a point to cover her feet in mud, so that from a distance it will look to a passerby that she is wearing shoes. Isn't that a bit extreme and laughable? And then of course, the first visit of Lucy's tomb, the ""sperm"" from Van Helsing's candle drips onto her face plate. As I understand it, there may have been something about whale sperm used in the wax of candles then, but still, isn't this an outward display of a lecherous old man?For me, the puns and allegory was so suggestive, that like reading Romeo and Juliet, I could help but laugh rather than being frightened by Dracula.;"

Especially since we have so many Victor Frankenstein's around. Honestly, there is nothing that suggests to me that he should have compounded his creation by creating a female version. How was that supposed to work... I mean, really?! The movies that convey a Mrs. Frankenstein Monster are accurate, I think. She would kill herself...that the male counterpart doesn't suggests more selfishness than Victor ever did.Victor is self-absorbed, but his situation has become that of the modern man. Most of us sacrifice technology for a personal connection to someone. The fact we are taking an online class is proof enough of that. I've also thought of Frankenstein as less a morality play (because the moral is way too transparent) and more of an allegory. The parallels between Victor and his monster are startling and I'm surprised in bringing up Forbidden Planet, Professor Rabkin failed to mention how the monster represents Victor's id or super-ego, depending on his state.;I understand where you're coming from, but his creature's wish is anything but modest. I appreciate that few have any sympathy for Frankenstein, but for the same reason, you should have little sympathy for the murderous monster he created.Two points. Victor did everything he could for Justine. If he told the truth, it would be a wild story. And just like in the real world, it is almost impossible to overcome a murder's confession, no matter what her intention. I really cannot comprehend this critique of Victor. Criticize him for isolating himself at Ingolstadt in his studies, leaving the monster immediately after its creation or any other number of issues, but Justine's death is an unavoidable consequence of his monster.As for ""modest wish"", Victor already lost two people to the monster's rage and you believe those deaths should be rewarded? If we are to make the monster a child (which his speech and thought processes are certainly nothing like a child's), then he should be punished and being too powerful to punish, perhaps destroyed. Would Victor be more sympathetic if he destroyed his monster with some clever trick? I think Mary Shelley intentionally had Victor as spineless, so that the tragedy could play its way through like a classic Greek tragedy. But I cannot see how giving him a woman would have satiated him. As a woman, Mary Shelley knew that there is no such thing as ""giving someone a woman', because you cannot guarantee love or satisfaction. And would sex even be possible with no hope of procreation? Would that please the monster or would he come killing more people for getting the power to procreate over time? How much is enough for such a powerful, unstoppable creature?;Isn't that the interesting bit? Neither Victor nor his monster are a complete person. Victor is able to give life, but cannot take it, while the monster deals death with no ability to procreate. It is a tragic divorce that suggests separating Victor from his creation is not an answer to the questions brought up in the story.;I think this a valid critique of Victor - he is mentally imbalanced, almost unhinged in his sanity. Constantly he doubts reality and what is happening to him. This makes for passages filled with self-doubt, suggesting he is a poor choice of narrator. He does try to reason with authorities, but he knows, just like we do, that there is no way to save Justine. No one would believe him that a monster he created was clever enough to plant a locket in revenge of its creator! This plea rarely works with humans much less anything else. What you are reading in the narrative is how Victor uses Justine's trial as a sense of horror rather than a detailed blow-by-blow courtroom drama. Do you really think Mary Shelley intended us to condemn Victor for Justine or that she just wanted the natural chain of tragedy to impact him?;I appreciate that viewpoint and no doubt Professor Rabkin does, too. I do not think it is wrong, just not my opinion. I do not like Victor, but to criticize him so heavily as to claim that is the moral point of the novel I cannot agree with. The problem with Victor is that he creates a monster, but has no capacity or ability to parent it. I think the point is not that others couldn't have tried more ways to love it, but that as humans with the right to create, we are inherently selfish creatures, able to create life but genetically questionable in protecting it. It is easy to criticize Victor until you realize that some of his behaviors actually hit home. It is his creation that rips his life asunder, not him. I agree that Victor's poor relationships may have provided touchpoints for the monster, but it is the monster and Victor's inability to understand and control it.I have often seen the monster as the symbol of industrialization and innovation. How often have we created something only to find that we have no control of how it is used, misused and possibly tears our contemporary existence apart? Ultimately, you may hate Victor, but his pain is ours as well, no matter our best intentions.;Ultimately, we are to feel sympathy for both Victor and his monster, but never to lose sight of the shortcomings of both. They both are examples of how NOT to be and BOTH of them are warnings for us all.;An interesting article I'd thought to share...  http://kaylathetheoxenophile.wordpress.com/professional-readings/a-literary-criticism-on-nathaniel-hawthornes-dr-heideggers-experiment-using-a-formalistic-approach-centered-on-deciphering-studied-texts-symbols-to-find-its-speci/ I agree with its conclusion ... do you?

The creature, in his own bizarre way, seemed almost more ethical than the human.   ;The suit the monster is wearing in that Hugh Grant movie is pretty impressively well-tailored -- considering the creature is meant to be 8 feet tall...     ;With my Frankensteinian images formed largely through movies, I had always thought of the monster as a big, doltish creature who moved with the clunkiness of a rusted robot and had a more or less monosyllabic vocabulary of grunts and snarls, at best.   So it came as quite a surprise to read Shelley's depiction of an incredibly articulate being -- fond of Goethe, Plutarch and Milton -- who is not only huge and powerful but tremendously well-spoken and as graceful as an athlete. So, which image serves the story better? Obviously, the monster would not have been able to reason, beg, argue and plead with its maker as effectively had it been limited to a childlike vocabulary. And I suppose we're to think its pain at the cold rejection by humans is all the more keenly felt, given its intelligence?   The movie version, on the other hand, can perhaps better convey a sort of noble-savage image, a simple being frustrated by its limitations (though if he existed today, the NBA would love to get its hands on him!)   and by human rejection.What does anyone think?   ;Solitude is also an interesting theme when you compare/contrast this book to ""Dracula"" -- where a major theme was the constructive collaboration of a team of smart, competent -- and pretty level-headed -- people to find a solution to a frightening, existential threat.   ;Terrific observation, Elizabeth!   There's no doubt that the weather affects our mood and our outlook on life, and a cold, gray, weirdly abnormal summer like that would be bound to affect someone as sensitive as Shelley evidently was.   Thanks for pointing this out.;Actually,   there WERE other witnesses, at least if we take Frankenstein at his word:   ""Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.""  ;Shelley devotes pages and pages and pages to the monster telling his story, all leading up to his request that Frankenstein make him a mate -- then in a few sentences, F. says no and the monster goes dashing angrily down the mountainside. She spends chapter after chapter describing F's change of heart and his final decision to make a ""bride"" for the monster, followed by his long, circuitous   trip to England and thence to his ocean-side laboratory -- then, in the course of a sentence or two, when the monster suddenly appears to watch, F. changes his mind and instantly destroys the work-in-progress (by the way, it's not hard to understand how F. could have found plenty of body parts in the big city -- but out there in the middle of nowhere??).   I just find the pacing horrible. It's all-or-nothing, either agonizingly slow, or else agonizingly fast -- the only constant being the agonizing part. I think Shelley needed a good (patient, talented) editor. Anyone else? ;Well, maybe ""pacing"" wasn't exactly the right word.   What I was trying to get at was that after a LOOOONG, drawn-out build-up,   Shelley reaches a point of climax but just seems to breeze past it without fully explaining, describing or elaborating how and why things happen.   It seems, for example, that just a glimpse of the monster as Frankenstein was working on the ""bride"" was enough to make him throw away months and months of work and planning in a moment.     Maybe it was just me, but I felt under-served.   It was if the candle she was working by was burning down to its final few flickers and she knew she had to wrap things up quickly.   I wanted more.    ;Oxana, that's absolutely relevant to Frankenstein.   During the creature's months in the shack up in the mountains, he fully convinces himself that because he loves and appreciates the family on the other side of the wall, and has nothing but the warmest and most complete admiration for them, and plans to approach them in a peaceful and loving manner, he can expect the same from them.

Sometimes it's fun and appropriate to read and interpret a novel at an only superficial level. After all, maybe what the author meant to do was tell a story, without any subliminal allegories or symbols. However, at least when I signed up in this course I figured (correctly) that it would be mostly about literally analyzing (as in dissecting) the story to find as many ulterior meanings as possible. A lot of people don't like that, but in many cases, I think it allows us to see deeper, different layers to the writing.;In the last video in this unit,  Some Thoughts on Love, Professor Rabkin says Victor destroyed his ""Monster's"" bride because he was small-minded, petty and mean. Does anyone else think he's being a bit too rough on Frankenstein's character?I think Victor's concerns were genuine regarding the creature's potential children (that they would come to loathe and attack humanity), even if they were founded on his unjust hatred of his creation and therefore misguided. In that sense, his purported reason for destroying his bride seemed to me sincere. Of course, Frankenstein was precipitated and irresponsible for hating his ""Monster"" so profoundly, but I believe his intentions were not, essentially, evil or mean-spirited.Moreover, Professor Rabkin dismisses his character as egotistical and, in a sense, incapable of love. I have to disagree with him here too; his love at least towards Elizabeth, his father and his fondness for Clerval, though probably of a selfish nature, seemed authentic. As did, I should say, his ability to profoundly and poignantly admire the wonders of nature.What do you guys think?;You're missing the point. The professor makes him out to be a sociopath, I just don't think he was, in essence, evil. Egotistical certainly, grossly misguided absolutely, and vain to boot. But not, I would say, evil. I think Walton's admiration of him was not completely misplaced. He got caught up in his fervor for knowledge and discovery, and had a thrifty moral compass throughout, besides being a horrid judge of character with his creation. However, consider this: he was not a murderer, thief or defiler (at least, not a defiler of the living, and of the dead only for an episode after which he realized how horrifying his actions were).In fact, his list of serious crimes amount to three things, none of which measure up in severity to his creation's murders: firstly, being irresponsible, prejudicial and mean-spirited to his  ""Monster""  from the get-go; secondly, allowing Justine to hang without earnestly attempting to provide reasonable doubt as a testifying witness; and finally, destroying the creation's bride and his only hope of happiness. But again, I think this was a result of being misguided and reserved in his judgment, precisely because of selfishness, and not because he was ""evil"".;Javier, his actions against the monster were, well... monstrous. But I mean it's not like Frankenstein was completely unjustified in believing that his creation could be, to some extent, evil. He  did murder an innocent boy and frame an innocent woman. My sympathy to the monster extended as far as his first murder in cold blood, as would be the case, I think, with any other figure, fictional or real. In this sense, killing (or rather, not finishing) the creature's bride was not an act of mere pettiness or meanness.;Well, to be fair, Frankenstein did try to sway the judges (""my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them""). If he had told the truth, he would probably have been branded a madman, like he thought. He could have made something up about witnessing something suspicious, but as he was not even in Geneva when the murder occurred they probably would have thought he was making it up to defend Justine, whom the judges knew he was fond of.I know it seems like I'm defending Frankenstein, and in a way, I suppose I am; it just seems to me a lot of people berate him way too harshly. He certainly was not blameless, but remember, he wasn't the one who murdered William, Elizabeth or Clerval, and I think it's unlikely, in any case, that he could have saved Justine, whose death really lies in the hands of the creature that framed her.;"

I like to interpret this as a science fiction novel which expresses the fear of technology's impact on our society and our survival.Saying the monster didn't exist is like saying that the machines weren't really harvesting the humans for energy in the Matrix (first movie) and that Keanu Reeves was just hallucinating. Both interpretations work, but the latter robs the story of its meaning.;I'm sorry to say that I thought both were pretty monotone. I thank god that Shelley at least had a better vocabulary. Whenever Stoker had to describe something positive he used the words 'good', 'sweet', 'pretty' and 'pure' no matter who the narrator. He even once described Mina as 'good, good, sweet, sweet' as if by repeating the same words he somehow made it better. As for the vampires, the only word he used to describe them was 'voluptuous'.Shelley has a better grasp over basic descriptions but nuanced characters and the power of suggestion seem to be beyond both their powers.;Your idea is very interesting. I don't really agree with it, mainly because I didn't see Shelley at any time even hint that this possibility is something she considered worth exploring. However, I see what you are driving at. The great similarity in the stories of the creator and creation can be an indication of a split personality. I mean:- Victor has intellectual passion that results in a discovery that results in monster.- Monster has academic inclinations that result in its question of identity that result in its anger.- Monster's anger results in victor's anger (death of William) and fear.- Victor's anger brings destruction upon Monster's bride.- Monster's anger brings destruction upon Victor.They have a symbiotic relationship going on. It literally looks like they feed off of each others passions. This could Victor's convoluted way of not taking responsibility for the deaths. He could attribute his creation of the monster to intellectual curiosity and the destruction of the bride to saving the planet from a new species. This would justify all the murders in the novel. I mean sure, he would feel bad and blame himself, but in his heart of hearts, he would know that he couldn't have done anything to stop that monster. It could be for this comfort that he creates this monster, as a thing to take the fall for his own misconducts. I don't entirely believe this, but its possible.What I find much more interesting is the suggestion that knowledge leads to misery. By the monster's own admission, its knowledge of human affairs was what led it to question its own identity, existence, and loneliness, thus ultimately leading to its grief. Frankenstein's acquisition of an amazing scientific advancement was what sealed his fate. Now, i am not a Christian, so I don't know if this is true, but in Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card, there is a biblical allusion to the tree of knowledge vs the tree of life. The implication (in the novel) is that superior powers of intellect must be compensated for by a shorter life. However, Mary Shelley goes way beyond this. She equates life to eros (life-force or sexual instinct) exhibited in Victor's act of creation and the monster's desire for a wife. Due to the consumption of the fruit from the tree of knowledge, the eros is converted to thanatos which is:  ""the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state"". This is exhibited by Victor tearing up the monster's bride as well as the monster's murders. More disturbingly, Victor's pursuit of knowledge, the creation of the monster, threatened the logos, or the rationality principle. The monster's framing of Justine and its misuse of its knowledge of our justice system (note the similarity of the name Justine to justice) causes Elizabeth to begin to doubt in the integrity and fairness of the justice system. The monster begins to sow the seeds of anarchy, upsetting the smooth rationality of the current institutions.Thanatos is associated with counter-intuitive or unnatural behavior (such as the historical events the monster studied about). Murder definitely qualifies as both. Mary Shelley has repeatedly shown how the thirst for knowledge results in the unnatural and the grotesque. Although Frankenstein is a science fiction novel, rather than heralding the future, it shies away from it. In the novel, science is seen as something which disturbs the balance and progress as endangering the status quo. Any form of change (both social and evolutionary) is seen with fear. I find this regressive knowledge vs life attitude to be the central conflict of this novel, and in today's context, I think that this view is completely outdated. Right now, innovation is the only way to solve the world's problems. Retreating to the Swiss Alps and acting as if the industrial revolution never occurred isn't going to help. Neither are novels like Frankenstein.;I felt the same about the destruction of the bride. What I found even more annoying were the huge descriptions of natural beauty that seemed to have no bearing on the novel. I love huge descriptions when they are actually there for a purpose, such as symbolism or atmosphere (like in H P Lovecraft) but when they are repetitive scenes of beauty which serve no purpose other than to reiterate the protagonists despondency for the millionth time, I get kinda pissed off!;I think that large vision is never an excuse for shoddy craftsmanship. A writer cannot be a great artist with a brilliant story and no technique. The novel which suffers from this defect cannot be a great novel.;I think Frankenstein recoils from the monster because he is his own creation. Creation in the 19th century was attributed to God and the idea of man having the power to grant life must have been considered horrific. It is this belief which branded Frankenstein, his otherness caused by the identity of his creator. Before he was animated, Frankenstein's bench-mark of beauty must have been sculpture or works of art. However, after giving him life, Victor has challenged God and therefore, since man is inferior to God, his creation must also be inferior to God's creation. On animation, the bench-mark shifts to the perfection of the human form, and the monster falls short due to the human identity of his creator.;"

I wrote my essay about ""The Bosom Serpent"" and ""Young Goodman Brown"" since they were both in Mosses of an Old Manse.   I could never find where the required Poe readings were listed. The syllabus said that all the required stories are in The Portable Poe, so I assumed we were responsible for reading the entire collection. Where were these stories listed?;I'm glad you posted this thread. I'm a little bit unclear about exactly what oedipal structure entails. When Professor Rabkin talks about it he says that we're not talking about Freudian version of the Oedipus complex, but rather, we're referring to the actual myth of King Oedipus. I failed to see how the ""generational struggle"" was a major component of the original myth. King Oedipus was never fighting for his wife's affections; he was awarded them because he defeated the Sphinx. It would be nice if someone could provide a simple definition of oedipal structure because I'm still a bit confused. Thank you.  ;I had the same experience. Evaluators took of points because they claimed that we were only supposed to read the Hawthorne stories specifically named on the syllabus. I believe they are mistaken. I wrote my essay about ""Young Goodman Brown"" and ""The Bosom Serpents,"" two stories from Mosses of an Old Manse.   I thought the syllabus said we are responsible for all the stories in Mosses of an Old Manse, Twice-Told Tales, and The Portable Poe. I know that's a lot to read, but so far the bar has been set pretty high for this course's workload.  ;Anyway, this is what I originally thought, but I stand corrected. There is a separate section that denotes the specific readings:  In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee.""  All the readings except Ray Bradbury's  The Martian Chronicles  and Ursula K. LeGuin's  The Left Hand of Darkness  will be available online at no charge.I guess I just overlooked this information. Ooops.  ;Emmanuelle, that couldn't have been my essay you read. I discussed ""The Bosom Serpents,"" not the ""Tell-Tale Heart."" I'm really disappointed with myself that I didn't analyze the assigned stories for this essay. I could have just as easily used ""The Birthmark"" and ""Rappaccini's Daughter"" to support my thesis.  Oh well.  I've  decided to post my essay  in case you're interested in reading it. Enjoy.  In  Doctor Who, a British science fiction drama,  the lead character suggests that both    the devil    and the    things that men do    are the same thing in the end. Although Hawthorne did not believe these ideas were entirely the same, his writings show a greater concern for the    things that men do    because of evil's ubiquitous nature.  Even though Hawthorne personally believed in the existence of a devil, his journal entries never explored the nature of Satan.   When his stories gave evil a physical form, the forms were metaphorical. For example, in    Young Goodman Brown    Satan bears a    considerable resemblance    to the protagonist and has the same    rank and file.    By drawing this comparison, Hawthorne wants the reader to think about the evils inside of Brown   s own heart. By the end of the story Goodman Brown himself becomes the most frightful thing in the forest. Hawthorne turns the reader's attention to the evil that every human is capable of.  We see this again in    Egotism,    when the sin of pride appears as one   s own personal snake. Even though the Bible has portrayed Satan as a snake, the serpent here does not represent Satan but rather reflects Hawthorne   s own personal belief of original sin.   This idea is supported through Roderick   s suggestion that there   s    poisonous stuff in any man   s heart to generate a brood of serpents.   Rosina confirms the metaphorical nature of the serpent when she says that    what it typified is as shadowy as itself.     The greatest danger to Hawthorne was looking at other   s sins without acknowledging the evil lurking within. It   s just like the narrator of    Young Goodman Brown    says:    The fiend is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man.    For Hawthorne, the fiend wasn   t some noisy beast devouring souls; she was the sultry voice already inside our heads     distorting our self-concepts.  Hawthorne, Nathaniel.

I've been doing some research to try to find out what Hawaiian or Pacific Island tradition this refers to. We know that it must be a Pacific Island tradition because Dr. Moreau mentions in chapter 14 that the  Kalaka people are the ones who educated the gorilla. I find it a very strange coincidence that the Shaka sign that surfers use today  demonstrates 3 missing fingers just as the gorilla's gesture does. Is there a correlation here? As far as I can tell, the history of the Shaka sign only dates back to the 1950s, nearly a century after Wells wrote The Island of Dr. Moreau. It's possible that some portion the Shaka sign's history has been forgotten. Maybe there was a protosymbol that predated the Shaka sign that time has forgotten. If anyone could shed some light on this issue, I might actually be able to sleep tonight. I'm dying to figure this out. Here is  what is already known about the history of the  Shaka sign: think:  http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/7837-the-history-of-the-famous-surfing-shaka-sign;Here is the passage I was referring to:  [The Gorilla] seemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held his own hand out and counted his digits slowly,    One, two, three, four, five     eigh?    I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did the same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction. Then his  swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift movement     and vanished.Perhaps I was mistaken to call this a ""greeting"" because now that I read it again, I see that Edward, once he discovered that it was common for these Beast People to be missing up to 3 fingers, no longer thinks it's a greeting. Nevertheless, I am still convinced this gesture has a meaning. The gorilla responds to the sign with ""immense satisfaction."" This tells me that the symbol has some sort of personal meaning to the gorilla, perhaps even to the Kalaka people who trained him as well.;Hello everyone! I thought it would be fun to discuss adaptations of our required readings as well explicit or implicit references to those works.

Such worry (that I mentioned at the top of this comment) seems just  Victor's paranoia; considering how badly the creature needed the bride and how his sorrowful experiences had lead him think like that,  Victor, as  a creator to take responsibility over his creation, should have satisfied the creature's modest wish.;"

After the process the student can compare the grade and comment between the true course evaluation and this alternative evaluation.            The ""Alternative and Comparative Peer Evaluation"" real benefit is that the student can communicate with their evaluator about their disagreement and will give some insight and some 'answer' why their essay graded (like that) by their peer in the (real) peer assessment (if the grade remain the same point and similar comment).

Like Hawthorne's said in The  Birthmark, ""Thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its  invariable triumph over the immortal essence"" (1). There is Aylmer (1)  that  egocentrically think Georgiana birthmark is rather a boundary for  she to became perfect (beautiful) women and try remove the birtmark,  including that make Georgiana died (because the birthmark is unseparated  condition of Georgiana's nature). In ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" (1) there  is Giovanni who cannot understand and accept Beatrice condition, and  make she drink the antidote that result in her death (because the  Beatrice poison is part of her life).                  There is Owen that compensate his unresolved love and the  (perfect) beauty of Annie to the mechanical butterfly, like Owen said     it has absorbed my own being into itself;...is represented ... the soul  of an Artist of the Beautiful!   (1). In ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment  (2),"" we can see Heidegger's friends Medbourne, Killigrew, Gascoigne and  Widow Wycherly that still seek the perfect time of their youth when  changed by the water (their behavior dont change due experience of being  old before).                In Poe ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Man of  the Crowd,"" and ""Mesmeric Revelation"" (3) I've found Poe Fantasy about  strugle and way to understand other or ourself with some different way  like hipnotize, observation, etc.                  I think the moral in some Hawthorne and Poe novel is to make  unconditonal acceptance to other and learn from our own mistake  (imperfect state) to make introspection about who we are, especially  when we see and think about other and problems. Like Mr. Rabkin says  that the word ""know"" is contain some difference meaning (4), so we  cannot just use our ""know"" only without know what others ""know,"" its  like use empathy when see other people or problems.

So, please - be honest, I really want to know, and I will take no offense. Of course, any other ideas, comments or whatever are welcome. Thank you.Throughout  the centuries, many authors wrote about humans striving for perfection  at all costs. In the ancient Greece, the Myth of Icarus tells about a  man who flew to close to the Sun, thus destroying his own wings and  falling to death. That this motif is ubiquitous in all cultures, we can  conclude from looking into stories of Bladud, Jatayu and Kua Fu - who  represent the Briton, Indian and Chinese ""version of Icarus"",  respectively. The stories of ""why claiming the Sun"" are different for  these characters, but the actual cause is the same for all of them  (striving for perfection), just as is the final outcome (death). The  same idea appears in the Book of Genesis - Eve is tricked in eating from  the tree that will make her and Adam omnipotent, like God, but they are  punished by being excluded from Heaven. When comparing our world, the ""modern"" world, with the ancient  cultures, we claim ""progress and prosperity"". We claim that the science  and technology advancement allowed us to create a more developed  society. A society more evolved and better in all fields, from social  relations to healthcare. In the short-story ""The Birthmark"", N. Hawthorne writes about a  distinguished scientist, a man who astonished the whole Europe with his  mind's achievements. That man,  Aylmer, marries a woman with a birthmark  on her cheek, otherwise perfectly beautiful. Understanding this  perfection stained only by the birthmark, he uses all means available to  remove it. Eventually, he succeeds, but the wife dies. In this work, the author shows us that all these centuries, milions  of chips fabricated and bilions of engines manufactured later we still  suffer from the same weaknesses we suffered in the dawn of our time. The  human spirit is still willing to sacrifice himself and anything else  just to get a little bit closer to the perfection, for no matter how  short a time interval.FORM:peer 1     Form meets the satisfactory standard.  I found no structural errors.peer 2      The structure and grammar of the essay seems adequate. However, the  thesis presented did not have a conclusion. The third paragraph is a  description of the story and it is not needed since we all read the same  stories. I would suggest a bit more planning with the next essay. The  score for the Form is of 2.peer 4      Weird grammar fail, need for spell check, bad use of ""the"", and  confusingly constructed sentences. You did try for some big words  though.peer 5     Cite your workCONTENT:peer 1     This is a little hard to follow jumping to so many examples.  It is hard in 320 words to develop so many thoughts adequately.peer 2      The essay presents valid arguments. As mentioned earlier, the structure  of the essay and lack of conclusion makes it seem less insightful and  persuasive. Therefore, the score for the content is of 2.peer 4     Interesting idea but too much background and not enough from the work itself.COMMENTS:peer 1      I don't agree that these stories support striving for perfection as  much as seeking power.  Maybe  Aylmer wanted a ""perfect"" wife so he felt  more powerful as the possessor of the perfect woman.peer 4      Just really hard to read. More knowledge of the English language is  necessary to write a college level essay for an informed reader of this  course.TOTAL SCORE: 4;Thank you very much for your opinion .But still, my question remains: how bad my English is?;"
